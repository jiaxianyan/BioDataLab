  # Core Task
  Systematically search the PubMed database for research published between 2021/01/01 and 2021/03/01 to identify studies reporting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) involving Ciprofloxacin, acting as either the precipitant or the object drug. The search should employ keywords such as "Drug Interactions"[MeSH] or "drug-drug interaction", while strictly excluding drug-food and drug-gene interactions by filtering out terms like "Food-Drug Interactions"[MeSH Terms], "food"[Title], "Pharmacogenetics"[MeSH Terms], or "gene"[Title/Abstract]. Following the initial search, conduct a detailed abstract analysis to screen for and isolate literature that specifically focuses on clinical or pharmacological interactions between Ciprofloxacin and other pharmaceutical agents, ensuring all irrelevant topics are removed from the final collection.

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: JSON list of objects. The list must include all articles obtained from the initial PubMed search.
  - Each object must contain exactly two fields:
    - `"PMID"`: PubMed ID as a string
    - `"Accepted"`: Boolean value (`true` if the article meets all inclusion and filtering criteria, `false` otherwise)
  - Save Path: Save the complete list to: `<r></r>/ddinter_retrieval.json`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/ddinter_retrieval/`

    # Output Example (For Reference Only)
  [
    {
      "PMID": "99999999",
      "Accepted": false
    },
    {
      "PMID": "88888888",
      "Accepted": true
    }
  ]
