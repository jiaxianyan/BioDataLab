  # Core Task
  Search PubMed for previous HSC-focused studies using single-cell RNA sequencing data, with the following query and date restriction:`query = ('("Hematopoietic Stem Cells"[Title/Abstract] OR "HSC"[Title/Abstract])'AND ("single-cell RNA sequencing"[Title/Abstract] OR "scRNA-seq"[Title/Abstract])'NOT ("Hepatic Stellate Cells"[Title/Abstract])') AND ("2023/02/10"[Date - Publication] : "2023/03/10"[Date - Publication])`. Select studies that meet the following criteria: (i) datasets are publicly accessible; (ii) data is generated using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology; (iii) included cell types are restricted to early-formed HSCs, HSCs, and their derived cell types.

    # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: JSON list of objects. The list must include all articles obtained from the initial PubMed search.
  - Each object must contain exactly two fields:
    - `"PMID"`: PubMed ID as a string
    - `"Accepted"`: Boolean value (`true` if the article meets all inclusion and filtering criteria, `false` otherwise)
  - Save Path: Save the complete list to: `<r></r>/stemdriver_retrieval.json`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/stemdriver_retrieval/`
