Task: |
  Calculate the Spearman correlation coefficient between protein abundance and transcript expression levels. 
  
  The input data is provided in two separate CSV files: `benchmark/dataset/CancerProteome/protein_abundance.csv` and `benchmark/dataset/CancerProteome/transcript_levels.csv`. 
  
  Both files contain a ''GeneID'' column for matching, a ''Protein_Abundance'' column, and a ''Transcript_Level'' column, respectively.
  
  Merge the two files on ''GeneID'', then compute the correlation. Save the final calculated correlation coefficient as a single numeric value in `<r></r>/cancerproteome_annotate.txt`.

  Output Example:
  ```
  0.85
  ```

  All intermidate results should be save in `<t></t>/cancerproteome_annotate` directory.
