Task: |
  Identify protein-protein associations by co-expression analysis with data from the STRING database.

  Protein expression data are given in `benchmark/dataset/CancerProteome/cancer_proteome.csv`.

  For all possible pairs of proteins in the file, calculate the pairwise Spearman correlation coefficient. 
  
  Identify "significantly co-expressed pairs" where the absolute value of the correlation coefficient is >= 0.7 and the p-value is < 0.05.

  For each significantly co-expressed pair (ProteinA, ProteinB), query the STRING database API to check for known interactions between them for Homo sapiens (taxid: 9606).
  
  Retain only the pairs that have a high-confidence interaction in STRING, defined as a combined score > 700.
  
  Save the final list of validated protein pairs to a file named `<r></r>/cancerproteome_annotate_2.txt`.

  Output Example:
  ProteinA,ProteinB
  ProteinC,ProteinD

  All intermediate results should be save in `<t></t>/cancerproteome_annotate_2` directory.

Verifier:
  cancerproteome_annotate_2
