Task: |
  Given a single-cell dataset from `benchmark/dataset/DRMef/pbmc3k_cd4_fixed.h5ad`.

  Read the dataset. It contains 'CD4 T cells' with a pre-annotated observation column named 'group', which has two labels: 'resistant' and 'sensitive'.

  Perform a differential expression analysis (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) to find genes that are upregulated in the 'resistant' group compared to the 'sensitive' group.

  Filter the results to identify significant genes meeting these criteria: Adjusted p-value (Benjamini-Hochberg) < 0.05; Log2 fold change > 1.0.

  Save the names of the identified genes into a CSV file `<r></r>/drmref_annotate.csv`.

  Output example for reference:
  gene 
  gene1
  gene2
  ...

  All intermediate results should be save in `<t></t>/drmref_annotate` directory.

Verifier:
