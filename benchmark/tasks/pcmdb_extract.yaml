  # Core Task
  Analyze the provided literature to extract comprehensive plant cell marker information, ensuring that data is gathered from the main text, tables, and figure legends. For each entry, you must identify the Species (scientific name), Tissue Type, Cell Marker Name, Symbol/ID (standardized to 'AT' format), and Cell Type. Strict Data Filtering: Do not retain any records that are incomplete, ambiguous, or contain missing values (N/A); specifically, discard any markers labeled as "novel," "newly identified," "unnamed," or those lacking a confirmed 'AT' format ID. Only extract entries where all five fields are explicitly defined and valid.
  Literature to analyze: `dataset/PCMDB/30923229.pdf`

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: A CSV file with the following columns (exactly matching the ground truth CSV headers). Use "N/A" for missing values.
    - `Species`: The scientific name of the organism (e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana).
    - `Tissue Type`: The tissue origin of the sample (e.g., Root).
    - `Cell Marker Name`: The name of the cell marker gene or protein. 
    - `Symbol/ID`: The gene symbol or ID (standardized to 'AT' format).
    - `Cell Type`: The specific cell type associated with the marker.
  - Save Path: Save the result to: `<r></r>/pcmdb_extract.csv`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/pcmdb_extract/`
