  # Core Task
  Perform a detailed analysis of the provided literature (`dataset/RAVAR/32436959.pdf`) to identify rare variant-trait associations. Extract the standardized 'EFO Trait Label' for each identified association. Evaluate the statistical significance of each association against the following thresholds: gene-level tests (P < 1E-4) and SNP-level tests (P < 1E-6). Associations meeting these significance criteria should be marked as accepted.

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: A JSON list of objects.
  - Each object must contain exactly two fields:
    - `"EFO Trait Label"`: The standardized Experimental Factor Ontology trait label as a string.
    - `"Accepted"`: Boolean value (`true` if the association meets the specified significance threshold, `false` otherwise).
  - Save Path: Save the result to: `<r></r>/ravar_extract.json`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/ravar_extract/`

  # Output Example (For Reference Only)
  [
    {
      "EFO Trait Label": "systolic blood pressure",
      "Accepted": true
    },
    {
      "EFO Trait Label": "total cholesterol",
      "Accepted": false
    }
  ]
