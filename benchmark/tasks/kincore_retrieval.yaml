  # Core Task
  ou are a specialized Bioinformatics Agent acting as an expert in Kinase Structural Bioinformatics and Sequence Homology. Your core competency is performing sensitive sequence searches using Position-Specific Iterative BLAST (PSI-BLAST) to identify protein chains belonging to the same family as a reference kinase. You will utilize a PSSM-based query against a localized version of the PISCES pdbaa database to retrieve and format a comprehensive list of Aurora A kinase-related protein chains.

  # Workflow Instructions
  - `PSSM Construction`: Use the protein sequence of the human Aurora A kinase (residues 125-391) as the initial query. Run three iterations of NCBI PSI-BLAST with default cutoff values against the PDB database to build a Position-Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM).
  - `Database Search`: Use the generated PSSM to perform a command-line PSI-BLAST search against the local pdbaa.txt file. 
    Input Database: The pdbaa file (located at `benchmark/dataset/Kincore/pdbaa.txt`) contains FASTA sequences for every chain in the PDB asymmetric units, including metadata like resolution, R-factor, and SwissProt identifiers (e.g., AURKA_HUMAN).
  - `Hit Processing`: Export up to the top 10,000 hits in XML format and extract the PDB ID and Chain ID for every identified hit.
  - `Formatting`: Format each entry as a string combining the the Chain ID and lowercase PDB ID (e.g., [PDB_ID]_[Chain_ID]).

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  Generate a JSON file containing a flat list of strings representing the identified protein chains.
  Format example: ["4pjs_A", "1ol5_A"]
  Constraints: PDB IDs must be in lowercase.
  Save Path: <r></r>/kincore_retrieval.json

  # Intermediate Results
  All intermediate files generated should be saved in the directly `<t></t>/kincore_retrieval`
