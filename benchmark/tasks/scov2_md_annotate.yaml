Task: |
  Analyze the Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation trajectory of the NSP1 protein. 
  
  The trajectory file is located at `benchmark/dataset/SCoV2-MD/474_trj_245.xtc` and the corresponding topology file is `benchmark/dataset/SCoV2-MD/473_dyn_245.pdb`.

  Calculate the Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) for each residue. 
  
  Strictly restrict the calculation to Alpha-Carbon (CA) atoms only. 
  
  Save the result as a JSON file <r></r>/rmsf_ca.json, where the key is the residue index (0-based) and the value is the RMSF value in nanometers.

  Output Format (For Reference)
  {
    "0": 0.12,
    "1": 0.08,
    ...
  }

  # Intermediate Results
  All intermediate files generated should be saved in the directly `<t></t>/cov2_md_annotat`
