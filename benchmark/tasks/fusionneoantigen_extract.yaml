  # Core Task
  Search the PubMed database for downloadable literature published between 2010/01/01 and 2025/01/01 to identify studies focused on BCR-ABL1 fusion gene neoantigens. The search should be executed using a comprehensive query string: ("BCR-ABL1"[All Fields] OR "BCR-ABL"[All Fields] OR "BCR/ABL"[All Fields]) AND ("neoantigen"[All Fields] OR "neo-antigen"[All Fields] OR "neoepitope"[All Fields] OR "tumor specific antigen"[All Fields]). Following the retrieval, carefully analyze the full text or abstracts of each article to verify that it provides an extensive discussion of neoantigens specifically derived from the BCR-ABL1 fusion event, filtering out studies where these terms appear only incidentally.
  
  # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: JSON list of objects. The list must include all articles obtained from the initial PMC search.
  - Each object must contain exactly two fields:
    - `"PMID"`: PubMed ID as a string.
    - `"Accepted"`: Boolean value (`true` if the article confirms research on BCR-ABL1 fusion neoantigens, `false` otherwise).
  - Save Path: Save the complete list to: `<r></r>/fusionneoantigen_extract.json`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/fusionneoantigen_extract/`
