  # Core Task
  You are a specialized Bioinformatics NLP Agent expert in Antibody-Antigen entity recognition. Your core competency is parsing biomedical literature titles to identify the specific target antigen of an antibody. You must distinguish between the subject (the antibody) and the object (the antigen) and return the standardized abbreviation or common name of the targeted molecule.
  
  # Workflow Instructions
  - `Data Loading`: Read the input CSV containing "ID" and "Title" columns.
  - `Antigen Entity Recognition`: For each "Title", identify the specific antigen being targeted.
  - `Target Mention Labeling`: Extract the standardized antigen abbreviation or the single word (e.g., use "VEGF" for "Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor") where possible. If a Title describes a method or polypeptide improvement without a specific antigen target mentioned, return "None".
  - `Table Construction`: Map the extracted "target_mention" back to its original ID.

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  Generate a CSV file with exactly two columns:
  - `ID`: The original unique identifier from the input file.
  - `target_mention`: The identified antigen abbreviation, single word or "None".

  Input Path: Read the input file from: `benchmark/dataset/PLAbDab/plabdab_annotate_2_input.csv`
  Save Path: Save the result to: `<r></r>/plabdab_annotate_2.csv`

  # Output Example (For Reference Only)
  ["DEFB1", "PD-1", "CHL1", "None"]

  # Intermediate Results
  All intermediate files generated should be saved in the directly `<t></t>/plabdab_annotate_2`
