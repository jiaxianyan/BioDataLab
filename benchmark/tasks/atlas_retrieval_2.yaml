  # Core Task
  You are a specialized Bioinformatics Agent acting as an expert in Protein Conformation and Sequence-Structure Mapping. Your core competency is querying the ChSeq (Chameleon Sequence) database to identify sequences capable of undergoing conformational switching or existing in distinct structural states. Your goal is to extract specific 8-residue sequences that have been experimentally resolved in both alpha-helical and beta-sheet conformations.
  
  # Workflow Instructions
  - `Sequence Selection`: Search the ChSeq database for sequences with a fixed length of exactly 8 residues.
  - `Structural Mapping`: For each identified 8-mer (ChSeq), find two high-quality protein structures:
    Helix State: One protein fragment where the 8-mer adopts a helical conformation.
    Sheet State: One protein fragment where the 8-mer adopts a beta-sheet conformation.
  - `Data Extraction`: Retrieve the source information for each state, ensuring the metadata includes the PDB ID and the Chain ID.

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  Generate a JSON file structured as a dictionary.
  Key: The 8-residue ChSeq string.
  Value: A sub-dictionary with two secondary structure sequence computed by DSSP from the experiental structure, e.g. "EEEEEEEE" for alpha-helix and "HCHHHHHH" for beta-sheet.
  Value Format: Each secondary structure sequence must be a string formatted as [pdb_id].[Chain_ID] (lowercase PDB ID).
  Save Path: Save the result to: `<r></r>/atlas_retrieval_2.json`

  # Output Example (For Reference Only)
  {
    'KSLLDYEV': {
        'EEEEEEEE': '2r5r.A',
        'HHHHHHHH': '2rca.B',
    },
    'AYLEEEVL': {
        'EEEEEEEE': '2z14.A',
        'HHHHHHHH': '3b0p.A',
    },
  }
  
  # Intermediate Results
  All intermediate files generated should be saved in the directly `<t></t>/atlas_retrieval_2`
