  # Core Task
  Analyze the literature to classify the primary therapeutic effect of the natural product-based drug combination into one of three categories: (1) enhancing drug efficacy by augmenting sensitivity and achieving synergy, (2) decreasing adverse drug reactions, or (3) reversing drug resistance.
  Literature to analyze: `dataset\NPCDR\27980427.pdf`, `dataset\NPCDR\25653233.pdf`, `dataset\NPCDR\23429291.pdf`, `dataset\NPCDR\21088503.pdf`, `dataset\NPCDR\32872376.pdf`, `dataset\NPCDR\29626307.pdf`

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: A JSON list of dictionaries with "PMID" and "TypeID". 
  - "PMID" is the filename, and "TypeID" is the classification category mentioned above (int).
  - Save Path: Save the complete list to: `<r></r>/npcdr_extract_1.json`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/npcdr_extract_1/`

  # Example Output (For Reference Only)
