Task: |
  # Core Task
  Analyze the full text of the provided literature to locate and extract dNTP measurement data from tables and text descriptions, including values, dimensions, errors, and experimental details (extraction method, measurement type, organism, and sample source).

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: A CSV file with the following columns (exactly matching the ground truth CSV headers). Use "N/A" for missing values.
    - `dNTP`: The specific dNTP measured (e.g., dATP, dTTP).
    - `Value`: The measured quantitative value.
    - `Dimension`: The unit of measurement (e.g., pmol/10^6 cell).
    - `Error`: The error or standard deviation associated with the measurement.
    - `Extraction method`: The method used to extract dNTPs (e.g., methanol).
    - `Measurement type`: The technique used for measurement (e.g., dNTP incorporation assay).
    - `Organism`: The scientific name of the organism.
    - `Sample source`: The biological source of the sample (e.g., cell line).
  - Save Path: Save the result to: `<r></r>/dntppooldb_extract.csv`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/dntppooldb_extract/`
