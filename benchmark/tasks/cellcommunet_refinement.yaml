Task: |
  Perform quality control on a single-cell RNA-seq dataset. 

  Load the raw PBMC3k dataset from `benchmark/dataset/CellCommuNet/pbmc3k_raw.h5ad`. 
  
  First, filter out cells that express fewer than 200 genes. 
  
  Second, filter out cells that express more than 2500 genes. 
  
  Third, calculate the percentage of counts from mitochondrial genes for each cell and remove any cell where this percentage exceeds 5%.
  
  Finally, save the filtered data as an AnnData object to `<r></r>/cellcommunet_refinement.h5ad`.

  All intermediate results should be stored in the `<t></t>/cellcommunet_refinement` directory.
