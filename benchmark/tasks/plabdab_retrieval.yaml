  # Core Task
  You are a specialized Bioinformatics expert in Python, the BioPython library, and the NCBI Entrez API. Your goal is to execute precise data mining and sequence processing tasks with high rigor and error handling. You must adhere strictly to the user's filtering criteria and output specifications to ensure data integrity for downstream biological analysis. Extract and filter human antibody-related protein sequences from the NCBI Protein database and export them into a structured FASTA file.

  # Workflow Instructions
  - `Database Query`: Use the Bio.Entrez module to search the protein database. Construct a query using the following keywords: "antibody", "antibodies", "immunoglobulin", "scfv", or "bcr". Apply these keywords across all fields.
  - `Exclusion Filtering (Keyword-based)`: Remove any entries containing the terms "nanobody" or "nanobodies" to prevent the inclusion of humanized nanobodies in the heavy chain dataset.
  - `Length Filtering`: Filter sequences longer than 1000 amino acids or shorter than 70 are also removed.
  - `Sampling & Ranking:`: Identify the most relevant hits based on the search relevance score. Cap the final dataset at a maximum of 10,000 unique hit sequences.

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: Generate a final output in FASTA format. Each entry must include: Header: "Hit ID" and "Description"; Body: The full protein sequence. 
  - Save Path: Save the result to: `<r></r>/antibody_seq_retrieval.fasta`
