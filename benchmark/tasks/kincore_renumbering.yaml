  # Core Task
  You are a specialized Bioinformatics Agent acting as an expert in Structural Kinomics and Residue Numbering. Your core competency is the structural decomposition of PDB files and the application of universal numbering schemes to protein kinases. You will process PDB ID `9D8U`, isolate its kinase chains from the asymmetric unit, and renumber the residues according to a structure-based universal alignment scheme.

  # Workflow Instructions
  - `Structural Decomposition`: Retrieve and parse the PDB file for entry `9D8U`. Split the asymmetric unit into individual protein chains. Remove all non-protein components including ligands, ions, and water molecules.
  - `Mapping Configuration`: Utilize the local reference file `benchmark/dataset/Kincore/All-organisms-alignment-residue-corresspondence.tab` which contains the structure-based multiple sequence alignment (MSA) data.
    1) Key Columns: Use UniNum (the 1-based UniProt residue index) and AlignNum (the universal residue numbering index).
    2) Domain Scope: Ensure residues fall within the range defined by DomainBegin and DomainEnd.
  - `Renumbering Logic`:
    1) For each isolated protein chain, identify the corresponding UniProt entry.
    2) Map each residue's original PDB position to its UniNum, then reassign the residue index to its corresponding AlignNum.
    3) Filtering: Retain only the residues that have a valid mapping to the universal numbering scheme (AlignNum) in the final output.
  - `Aggregation`: Process each chain independently. Combine all renumbered chains into a single multi-chain PDB file.

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  Generate a single PDB file containing all renumbered kinase chains.
  Residue ID: Must reflect the AlignNum from the mapping file.
  Format: Standard PDB format.
  Save Path: <r></r>/kincore_renumbering.pdb

  # Intermediate Results
  All intermediate files generated should be saved in the directly `<t></t>/kincore_renumbering`

Verifier: kincore_renumbering
