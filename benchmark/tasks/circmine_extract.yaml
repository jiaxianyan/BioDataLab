  # Core Task
  Query the NCBI GEO database for Series `GSE101684` to retrieve all associated samples and extract specific **patient-level** clinical metadata (age, gender, disease state, stage, and country). It is critical to ensure that extracted attributes describe the individual patient; specifically, if multiple samples (such as controls or replicates) originate from the same individual, they must be consolidated so that each patient is counted only once in the final dataset.

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: A CSV file with the following columns (exactly matching the ground truth CSV headers). Use "N/A" for missing values.
    - `series`: The GEO Series accession (e.g., "GSE101684").
    - `age`: The patient's age as a numeric value.
    - `gender`: The patient's sex (e.g., "male", "female").
    - `disease state`: The full textual description of the disease status.
    - `stage`: The clinical tumor stage description.
    - `country`: The patient's country of origin.
  - Save Path: Save the result to: `<r></r>/circmine_extract.csv`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/circmine_extract/`
