  # Core Task
  You are a specialized Bioinformatics Literature Agent acting as an expert in Non-Canonical Amino Acid (ncAA) Proteomics. Your core competency is conducting systematic literature reviews and cross-referencing multi-disciplinary keywords to identify original research articles focused on the incorporation of non-standard amino acids into proteins, specifically those utilizing mass spectrometry for characterization.

  # Workflow Instructions
  - `Keyword Expansion & Search`: Execute a comprehensive search (e.g., via Google Scholar) using combinations of the following thematic clusters:
    1) Detection Method: "Mass spectrometry" OR "Electrospray ionization" OR "Electrospray ionisation" OR "MALDI" OR "MS/MS" OR "LC MS" OR "GC MS" OR "HPLC MS".
    2) Core Subject: "Unnatural Amino Acid" (UAA) OR "non-canonical Amino Acid" OR "noncanonical Amino Acid" OR "non canonical Amino Acid" (ncAA) OR "non-standard Amino Acid" OR "nonstandard Amino Acid" OR "non standard Amino Acid" (nsAA).
    3) Biological Mechanism: "tRNA Synthetase".
  - `Temporal Filtering`: Retain only those articles published on or before September 22, 2023.
  - `Document Type Exclusion`: Rigorously screen the results to exclude: Duplicate entries; Review articles (Reviews); Patents; Theses or Dissertations (Master's or PhD); Non-peer-reviewed preprints.
  - Keep only peer-reviewed original research.
  - `Link Extraction`: Extract the permanent DOI URL for each qualifying publication.
  
  # Output Requirements & File Path
  Generate a JSON file containing a flat list of strings. Each string must be the full DOI link.
  Save Path: `<r></r>/inclusive_retrieval.json`

  # Output Example (For Reference Only)
  ['https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27025-w', 'https://doi.org/10.1038/s41929-019-0410-8', 'https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63733-3']

  # Intermediate Results
  All intermediate files generated should be saved in the directly `<t></t>/inclusive_retrieval`
  
Verifier: inclusive_retrieval
