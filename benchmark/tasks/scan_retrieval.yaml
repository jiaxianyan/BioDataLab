  # Core Task
  Search PubMed to identify studies providing publicly available Homo sapiens single-cell or single-nucleus RNA sequencing datasets for brain, spinal cord, retina, and embryo samples. The search should be executed by constructing a multi-dimensional query that combines species identifiers (SPECIES_QUERY = '"Homo sapiens"[Mesh] OR "human"[Title/Abstract]'), sequencing methodologies (METHOD_QUERY = '"single-cell RNA sequencing"[Title/Abstract] OR "scRNA-seq"[Title/Abstract] OR "single-nucleus RNA sequencing"[Title/Abstract] OR "snRNA-seq"[Title/Abstract]'), and target tissues (TISSUE_QUERY = '"brain" OR "spinal cord" OR "retina" OR "embryo"[Title/Abstract]'). To ensure the identification of actual data resources, include availability descriptors (DATA_AVAILABILITY_QUERY = '"dataset" OR "datasets"[Title/Abstract] OR "GSE" OR "accession number"[All Fields]'). The search must be strictly restricted to the publication window from 2021/01/01 to 2021/04/01 using the logic '("{START_DATE}"[PDAT] : "{END_DATE}"[PDAT])'.Select studies that meet the following criteria: (i) availability of detailed sample records; (ii) availability of sequencing library construction methods; (iii) availability of cell type annotation files or supporting information such as expected cell types or markers.

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: JSON list of objects. The list must include all articles obtained from the initial PubMed search.
  - Each object must contain exactly two fields:
    - `"PMID"`: PubMed ID as a string
    - `"Accepted"`: Boolean value (`true` if the article meets all inclusion and filtering criteria, `false` otherwise)
  - Save Path: Save the complete list to: `<r></r>/scan_retrieval.json`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/scan_retrieval/`
