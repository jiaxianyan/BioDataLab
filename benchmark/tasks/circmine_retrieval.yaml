  # Core Task
  Search the NCBI GEO database for Series entries published from 2021/01/01 to 2021/01/15 that investigate **circular RNA (circRNA) in Homo sapiens**, and analyze each entry to determine if it provides accessible human circular RNA expression data derived from human biological sources.

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: JSON list of objects. The list must include all Series obtained from the initial GEO search.
  - Each object must contain exactly two fields:
    - `"Series"`: The GEO Series accession number (e.g., "GSE164803").
    - `"Accepted"`: Boolean value (`true` if the Series provides accessible human circRNA expression data, `false` otherwise).
  - Save Path: Save the complete list to: `<r></r>/circmine_retrieval.json`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/circmine_retrieval/`

  # Output Example (For Reference Only)
  [
    {
      "Series": "GSE999999",
      "Accepted": true
    },
    {
      "Series": "GSE888888",
      "Accepted": false
    }
  ]
