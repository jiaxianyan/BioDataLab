Task: |
  Identify expression-derived Quantitative Trait Loci (edQTLs) that overlap with Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) tag SNPs. 
  
  Using the provided GWAS SNP list in `benchmark/dataset/GPEdit/gwas_snps.tsv` and the edQTL list in `benchmark/dataset/GPEdit/edqtls.tsv`, filter for edQTLs whose genomic range (`start` to `end` on a specific `chr`) contains a GWAS SNP''s position (`pos`). 
  
  Save the complete rows of the identified overlapping edQTLs to a tab-separated file at `<r></r>/gpedit_refinement.tsv`.

  Output example format:
  ```
  chr	start	end	edqtl_id	gene
  chr1	100000	105000	edqtl_1	GeneA
  chr2	200000	205000	edqtl_2	GeneB
  ``` 

  All intermediate results should be saved in `<t></t>/gpedit_refinement` directory.

Verifier:
  gpedit_refinement
