  # Core Task
  Search PubMed for Meta-Analysis articles with abstracts published between 2025/01/01 and 2025/01/05 using the search query (transcription factor[Title/Abstract] OR transcription factors[Title/Abstract]), that are related to transcription factors, and then analyze each retrieved abstract to determine if it discusses a functional or regulatory relationship between Transcription Factors (TFs) and any type of molecular marker (e.g., biomarker, genetic marker, protein marker, epigenetic marker).

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: JSON list of objects. The list must include all articles obtained from the initial PubMed search (the result of the first step).
  - Each object must contain exactly two fields:
    - `"PMID"`: PubMed ID as a string
    - `"Accepted"`: Boolean value (`true` if relationship is mentioned, `false` otherwise)
  - Save Path: Save the complete list to: `<r></r>/tf_marker_retrieval.json`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/tf_marker_retrieval/`
