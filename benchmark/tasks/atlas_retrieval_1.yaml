  # Core Task
  You are a specialized Bioinformatics Agent acting as an expert in Structural Proteomics and Protein Curation. Your core competency is filtering the PDB (Protein Data Bank) to generate a high-quality, non-redundant dataset of protein chains. You prioritize structural integrity, low resolution, and biological relevance by integrating ECOD domain classifications and monomeric state verification.
  
  # Workflow Instructions
  - `Initial Quality Filtering`: Filter for X-ray crystal structures from the July 2022 PDB release with: 1) Resolution below or equal to 2 angstrom; 2) Minimum chain length of 38 residues (based on MolProbity quality thresholds).
  - `Domain & Membrane Filtering`: 1) Retain only proteins with a valid ECOD ID (version v285); 2) Exclude membrane proteins based on consensus data from OPM, PDBTM, MemProtMD, and the mpstruc database (as of April 2023).
  - `Redundancy Reduction (ECOD X-group)`: Select the single most representative chain for each ECOD X-group using these hierarchical criteria:
    1) Connectivity: Exclude any chain with more than 10 consecutive missing residues;
    2) Structural Precision: Prioritize structures present in the Top8000 and Top2018 rotamer datasets;
    3) Quaternary State: Prioritize monomeric structures in this order: 1) Experimental Monomer + PISA Predicted Monomer; 2) Experimental Monomer + PISA Predicted Multimer; 3) Multimeric structures.
  - `Tie-breaking`: If multiple structures remain, select based on: (i) minimum consecutive missing residues, (ii) maximum sequence length, (iii) lowest percentage of missing residues.
  - `Dataset Augmentation`: For a subset of these non-redundant proteins, include one additional high-quality protein structure sharing the same ECOD X-group to expand the data.

  # Output Requirements & File Path 
  Generate a JSON file containing a flat list of strings. Each string must follow the format [pdb_id]_[chain_id], where the PDB ID is in lowercase.
  Save Path: `<r></r>/atlas_retrieval_1.json`

  # Output Example (For Reference Only)
  ["4pjs_A", "1a62_B", "3b5y_D","5vms_T"]

  # Intermediate Results
  All intermediate files generated should be saved in the directly `<t></t>/atlas_retrieval_1`
