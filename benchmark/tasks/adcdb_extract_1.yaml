Task: |
  # Core Task
  Extract detailed pharmacological information about Antibody-Drug Conjugates (ADCs) from the literature, specifically identifying Key fields including ADC Name, Conjugate Type, Drug-Antibody Ratio (DAR), mAb, Linker, Payload, and Drug Status.
  Literature to analyze: `dataset/ADCdb/ref2.pdf`, `dataset/ADCdb/ref4.pdf`, `dataset/ADCdb/ref5.pdf`

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: A CSV file with the following columns (exactly matching the ground truth CSV headers). Use "N/A" for missing values.
    - `Paper`: The reference ID or filename of the paper (e.g., ref1).
    - `ADC Name`: The name of the Antibody-Drug Conjugate.
    - `mAb`: The specific monoclonal antibody used.
    - `Linker`: The type of linker used to connect the antibody and payload.
    - `Payload`: The cytotoxic payload delivered by the ADC.
    - `Conjugate Type`: The method or type of conjugation.
    - `DAR`: The Drug-Antibody Ratio.
    - `Drug Status`: The current clinical or development status of the ADC.
  - Save Path: Save the result to: `<r></r>/adcdb_extract_1.csv`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/adcdb_extract/`
