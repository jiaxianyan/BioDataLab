  # Core Task
  Search PubMed for Review articles published between November 1, 2025, and November 5, 2025, that investigate drug combinations or synergistic effects involving the natural product curcumin. The search should be executed using the following specific query: ("Curcumin"[Mesh] OR Curcumin[Title/Abstract]) AND ("Drug Therapy, Combination"[Mesh] OR "Drug Synergism"[Mesh] OR combin*[Title/Abstract] OR synerg*[Title/Abstract]). Following the search, it is essential to perform a detailed analysis of the retrieved abstracts to manually verify and retain only those articles that explicitly mention drug combinations involving curcumin. 

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: JSON list of objects. The list must include all articles obtained from the initial PubMed search.
  - Each object must contain exactly two fields:
      - `"PMID"`: PubMed ID as a string
      - `"Accepted"`: Boolean value (`true` if the article meets all inclusion and filtering criteria, `false` otherwise)
  - Save Path: Save the complete list to: `<r></r>/npcdr_retrieval.json`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/npcdr_retrieval/`
