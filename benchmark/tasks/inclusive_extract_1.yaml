  # Core Task
  You are a specialized Bioinformatics NLP Agent acting as an expert in Synthetic Biology and Genetic Code Expansion (GCE). Your core competency is the high-fidelity extraction of experimental data from scientific literature regarding the site-specific incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs). You will process specific PDF publications to curate a structured dataset of orthogonal translation systems (aaRS/tRNA pairs), their origins, and their applications in protein engineering.

  # Workflow Instructions
  - `Literature Processing`: Parse the provided PDF files located at the specified path.
  - `Data Extraction & Formatting`:
    1) ncAA Identifiers: Extract abbreviations and full names. Use "not available" if missing.
    2) aaRS ID Construction: Follow the syntax [Org Abbr]-[Natural Substrate]RS ([Mutations/Wild Type]). (e.g., Ec-MetRS (wild type) or Mb-PylRS (Y271C, N311Q, Y349F, V366C)).
    3) tRNA ID Construction: Follow the syntax [Org Abbr]-tRNA [Natural AA] [Anticodon]. (e.g., Bs-tRNA Tyr CUA). Each tRNA has a name composed of three words: (a) abbreviation of the organism from which it was derived; (b) tRNA; (c) AA naturally transported by the tRNA; (d) anticodon. For example, 'Bs-tRNA Tyr CUA' indicates a tRNA naturally found in Bacillus subtilis, which transports tyrosine, whose anticodon is CUA. 
    4) Organism Mapping: Identify full scientific names for both aaRS and tRNA origins.
    5) Protein Application: Identify the target protein. Critical: If multiple proteins are tested in one paper, create a unique row for each protein.
    6) Site Mapping: If multiple independent sites are tested, separate with ; and sort by residue number (ascending). If multiple sites are incorporated simultaneously (jointly), use +.
    7) Host System: Identify the test organism or specify "in vitro".

  # Input File Path
  Input Path: `benchmark/dataset/iNClusive/` (Files: paper_data_17_21.pdf, paper_data_947.pdf, paper_data_966_1011.pdf, paper_data_1748.pdf, paper_data_2126_2127.pdf)

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  Generate a CSV file using a semicolon (;) as the delimiter for each input PDF file. 
  Output Path: <r></r>/inclusive_extract_1/
  Naming Convention: Output filenames must match the input PDF filename (e.g., paper_data_17_21.pdf results in paper_data_17_21.csv).
  The CSV must contain the following columns exactly as named:
    "ncAA abbreviation(s) used in the publication"
    "ncAA name, as mentioned in the publication"
    "aaRS ID (abbr. organism, abbr. natural substrate, RS, mutations if any)"
    "aaRS origin organism full name"
    "tRNA ID (abbr. organism, tRNA, natural AA transported, anticodon)"
    "tRNA organism"
    "Tested in (protein)"
    "Tested in (protein position)"
    "Tested in (organism/in vitro)"
