  # Core Task
  Select the provided literature that meet the following criteria: (1) Studies have reported significant single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTLs) associated with SNP rs10095121. To further validate or conduct in-depth analysis, it is necessary to locate the corresponding raw genotype measurement data from the relevant literature. If the experimental data in a study includes this variant (rs10095121), it is considered acceptable even if the SNP is not explicitly mentioned in the text; (2) studies use actual biological samples (excluding meta-analyses or secondary analyses) and contain at least 40 samples or 5,000 cells; (3) data is generated using reliable single-cell sequencing technologies (e.g., 10x, Smart-seq/Smart-seq2, CITEseq); (4) datasets include genome-wide or local region eQTL mapping.
  Literature to analyze: `dataset/scQTLbase/35672358.pdf`, `dataset/scQTLbase/37558883.pdf`, `dataset/scQTLbase/35915177.pdf`, `dataset/scQTLbase/40562914.pdf`

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: JSON list of objects. The list must include all articles obtained from the initial PubMed search.
  - Each object must contain exactly two fields:
    - `"PMID"`: PubMed ID as a string
    - `"Accepted"`: Boolean value (`true` if the article meets all inclusion and filtering criteria, `false` otherwise)
  - Save Path: Save the complete list to: `<r></r>/scqtlbase_retrieval.json`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/scqtlbase_retrieval/`
