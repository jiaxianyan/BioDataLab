Task: |
  # Core Task
    Systematically extract all molecular regulation events described in the provided research paper and organize the output into a structured format containing the Regulation Direction, the Mechanism Type, and the Standardized Symbol for each molecule.
    Literature to analyze: `dataset\NPCDR\paper.pdf`

  # Output Requirements & File Path
    -  Output format: A CSV file with the following columns (exactly matching the ground truth CSV headers). Use "N/A" for missing values.
      - `Direction`: Standardize all values to either "Up-regulation" or "Down-regulation" based on the experimental results.
      - `Type`: Specify the precise biological mechanism described (e.g., "Expression", "Phosphorylation", "Activation", "Cleavage", or "Translocation").
      - `Symbol`: Convert the common names or aliases used in the text (e.g., "p53", "EGFR", "TNF-alpha") into their corresponding official HGNC approved gene/protein symbols (e.g., "TP53", "EGFR", "TNF") using all-uppercase letters to ensure database compatibility and uniqueness.
    - Save Path: Save the complete list to: `<r></r>/npcdr_extract_2.csv`
    - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/npcdr_extract_2/`
