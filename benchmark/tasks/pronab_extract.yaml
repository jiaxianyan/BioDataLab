Task: |
  # Core Task
  Extract protein-nucleic acid binding data from the provided literature, specifically identifying Key fields including UniProt ID, protein mutation(s), nucleic acid name, nucleic acid type, PDB complex ID, experimental method, and thermodynamic parameters (dG and Kd).
  Literature to analyze: `dataset/ProNAB/10383437.pdf`

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: A CSV file with the following columns (exactly matching the ground truth CSV headers):
    - `UniProt Id`: The UniProt ID of the protein.
    - `Mutation Protein`: The mutation(s) in the protein (e.g., 'R355A' or 'wild').
    - `Nucleic Acid Name`: The name of the nucleic acid.
    - `Type Nuc`: The type of nucleic acid (e.g., 'DNA').
    - `PBD Compelx`: The PDB ID of the complex.
    - `Method`: The experimental method used.
    - `dG wild(Kcal/mol)`: The dG value for the wild type.
    - `Kd wild(M)`: The Kd value for the wild type.
  - Save Path: Save the result to: `<r></r>/pronab_extract.csv`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/pronab_extract/`
