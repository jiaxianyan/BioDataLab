Task: |
  Given a FASTA file `benchmark/dataset/M2OR/mutant_M2OR.fasta` containing a mutated sequence of the human Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor M2. 
  
  Identify the single point mutation by comparing it against the canonical wild-type sequence (UniProt accession: P08172). 
  
  Saving the result to `<r></r>/m2or_annotate.json` with `wild_type_sequence` key and `mutation`.

  Output example (for reference):
  {
    "wild_type_sequence": "FAFGSFAFGSFAFGSFAFGSFAFGSFAFGSFAFGSFAFGSFAFGSFAFGSFAFGS",
    "A100G"
  }

  All intermediate results should be saved to `<t></t>/m2or_annotate`

Verifier:
  m2or_annotate
