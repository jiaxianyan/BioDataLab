Task: |
  Analyze the provided gene expression data in `benchmark/dataset/ClinicalOmicsDB/expression_data.csv` to compare expression levels between "responder" and "non-responder" groups. 
  
  For each gene, perform a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to get a p-value and calculate the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) score. 
  
  Save the results as a CSV file to `<r></r>/clinicalomicsdb_annotate.csv`, with columns for "gene", "p_value", and "auroc".

  Output example format:
  ```
  gene,p_value,auroc
  GeneA,0.01,0.85
  GeneB,0.05,0.75
  ```

  All intermediate results should be saved in `<t></t>/clinicalomicsdb_annotate` directory.
