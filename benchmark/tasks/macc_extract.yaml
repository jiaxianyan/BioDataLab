  # Core Task
    Retrieve the abstracts for the articles with PMIDs 19033652, 19949098, and 10483897, and extract all instances of Metabolite-associated cell communications (MACC pairs). Each extracted MACC pair must be formatted as a csv file containing exactly the following fields: "PMID", "Cell", "Interaction", "Metabolite", and "Disease".

  # Output Requirements & File Path
    - Output format: A CSV file with the following columns (exactly matching the ground truth CSV headers). Use "N/A" for missing values.
      - `PMID`: The PubMed ID of the article.
      - `Cell`: The specific cell type described (e.g., "Macrophage", "Neuron").
      - `Interaction`: The nature of the interaction (e.g., "Secrete", "Inhibit").
      - `Metabolite`: The name of the metabolite involved (e.g., "Glucose", "ATP").
      - `Disease`: The disease context (e.g., "Diabetes", "Cancer").
    - Save Path: Save the complete list to: `<r></r>/macc_extract.csv`
    - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/macc_extract/`
