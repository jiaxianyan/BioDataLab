Task: |
  Load the NCBI GEO single-cell RNA-seq dataset GSE182298 located at `benchmark/dataset/SCovid/GSE182298`.'
  
  Perform Quality Control (QC) filtering with the following strict criteria:

  Filter out cells that have fewer than 200 detected genes.

  Filter out genes that are detected in fewer than 3 cells.

  Calculate the percentage of mitochondrial genes (genes starting with prefix "MT-") for each cell.

  Apply the tissue-specific mitochondrial filtering rule: If the input tissue is Liver, remove cells with a mitochondrial gene proportion > 50%. (Note: For non-liver tissues, the threshold would be > 20%).
  
  Save the list of remaining valid cell barcodes to a CSV file named <r></r>/qc_passed_barcodes.csv (single column, no header).

  All temp data should be save in `<t></t>/scovid_refinement`.

  Output Format (For Reference)
