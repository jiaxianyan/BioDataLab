  # Core Task
  Extract comprehensive sample metadata from the GSE210066 Series, including identifiers (Sample ID, Project ID), biological context (Sample type, Tissue, Disease), and technical details (Platform, RNA Source). Furthermore, carefully analyze the data to determine the total number of high-quality cells successfully captured (#Cell) and the Median UMI count for each sample.

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: A CSV file with the following columns (exactly matching the ground truth CSV headers). Use "N/A" for missing values.
    - `Sample ID`: The unique identifier for the sample (e.g., GSM number).
    - `Project ID`: The project identifier (e.g., GSE number).
    - `Sample type`: The type of sample (e.g., tumor tissue).
    - `Tissue`: The tissue of origin (e.g., liver).
    - `Disease`: The disease condition (e.g., intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma).
    - `Platform`: The sequencing platform used (e.g., 10x5').
    - `RNA Source`: The source of RNA (e.g., cell).
    - `#Cell`: The total number of high-quality cells.
    - `Median UMI`: The median Unique Molecular Identifier count.
  - Save Path: Save the result to: `<r></r>/disco_extract.csv`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/disco_extract/`
