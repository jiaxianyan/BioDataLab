Task: |
  Search the NCBI GEO database for Series containing 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data from animal gut or fecal samples. 
  
  The data should published between 2010.01.01 and 2024.01.01. 
  
  The search criteria must include the keywords "<key>gut microbiota</key>", "<key>16S rRNA</key>", "<key>V4</key>", and "<key>Illumina</key>". 
  
  The search should be limited to studies that are linked to a publication. 
  
  Save the list of resulting SRA Study accession numbers (SRR IDs) to a JSON file `<r></r>/amdb_retrieval.json`.

  Output format (for reference only):
  [
    "SRR12345678",
    "SRR12345679",
    "SRR12345680",
    ...
  ]

  All intermediate results should be saved in `<t></t>/amdb_retrieval` directory.
