  # Core Task
  Search GEO for cancer-related datasets involving Docetaxel treatment in human samples ('Homo sapiens') by executing a query that combines the drug identifier (DRUG = 'Docetaxel'), the species limit (SPECIES = '"Homo sapiens"[Organism]'), and cancer-specific descriptors (CANCER = 'cancer OR tumor OR carcinoma OR neoplasm'). The search must be restricted to the Series data type ('"gse"[Filter]') and filtered by a specific publication window from 2021/01/01 to 2021/06/01 using the logic '("{START_DATE}"[PDAT] : "{END_DATE}"[PDAT])'. Then manually select qualified datasets that meet five criteria: (1) include baseline (pre-treatment) expression profiles; (2) have a sample size of at least 10; (3) provide raw data files (CEL for microarray, FASTQ for RNA-seq); (4) for microarray data, are restricted to platforms GPL96 [HG-U133A], GPL570 [HGU133 Plus 2], and GPL571 [HG-U133A 2].

    # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: JSON list of objects. The list must include all articles obtained from the initial PubMed search.
  - Each object must contain exactly two fields:
    - `"Series"`: Series ID as a string
    - `"Accepted"`: Boolean value (`true` if the article meets all inclusion and filtering criteria, `false` otherwise)
  - Save Path: Save the complete list to: `<r></r>/ctr_db_retrieval.json`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/ctr_db_retrieval/`
