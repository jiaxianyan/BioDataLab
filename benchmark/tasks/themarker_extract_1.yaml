  # Core Task
  Analyze the provided literature to classify the therapeutic biomarker (ThMAR) CRP (also known as PTX1) into one of the following five types:
  1. Pharmacodynamic biomarker (PDY)
  2. Safety biomarker (SAF)
  3. Monitoring biomarker (MOI)
  4. Predictive biomarker (PRD)
  5. Surrogate endpoint (SUR)

  The definition, importance, and typical examples of each ThMAR type are explicitly described in the image `dataset\TheMarker\ThMARs_TYPE.png`.
  Literature to analyze: `dataset\TheMarker\34903842.pdf`, `dataset\TheMarker\25135077.pdf`, `dataset\TheMarker\30289572.pdf`, `dataset\TheMarker\19435794.pdf`,
  `dataset\TheMarker\FDA.pdf`

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: A JSON list of dictionaries with "PMID" and "TypeID".
  - "PMID" is the filename(For FDA.pdf, "PMID" is "FDA"), and "TypeID" is the classification category mentioned above (int).
  - Save Path: Save the complete list to: `<r></r>/themarker_extract_1.json`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/themarker_extract_1/`

  # Example Output (For Reference Only)
  [
    {
        "PMID": "22222222",
        "TypeID": 2
    },
    {
        "PMID": "33333333",
        "TypeID": 4
    }
