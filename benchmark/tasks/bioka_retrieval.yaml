  # Core Task
  Conduct a comprehensive literature search on PubMed for articles published between 2022/01/01 and 2022/01/05 related to biomarkers in cat species, using specific keywords (biomarker, marker, indicator, predictor). Exclude non-research articles (reviews, comments, letters, editorials) and non-English publications. Refine the abstract analysis to extract sentences containing both entity terms ('biomarker', 'marker', 'indicator', 'target') and clinical qualifiers ('diagnostic', 'prognostic', 'therapeutic', 'valuable') to filter the entire paper collection.. Finally, perform a thorough filtration and curation of the collection, selecting papers with a specific focus on a particular disease or trait, concise conclusions, and detailed experimental information (e.g., in vitro, in vivo, clinical tests, or behavioral tests).

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: JSON list of objects. The list must include all articles obtained from the initial PubMed search.
  - Each object must contain exactly two fields:
    - `"PMID"`: PubMed ID as a string
    - `"Accepted"`: Boolean value (`true` if the article meets all inclusion and filtering criteria, `false` otherwise)
  - Save Path: Save the complete list to: `<r></r>/bioka_retrieval.json`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/bioka_retrieval/`
