  # Core Task
  Query the NCBI GEO database for Series `GSE116315`, retrieve all associated samples, and extract specific metadata fields including sample name, project ID, cell line/tissue, organism, treatment, genotype, and technique for each sample.

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: A CSV file with the following columns (exactly matching the ground truth CSV headers). Use "N/A" for missing values.
    - `Sample Name`: The GSM accession and title. Connect them using a hyphen (-) in the middle, for example: GSM1234567-Sample1.
    - `Source Project ID`: The GEO Series accession (e.g., GSE999999).
    - `Cell Line/Tissue`: The specific cell type or tissue used (e.g., HeLa cells).
    - `Organism`: The scientific name of the organism (e.g., Homo sapiens).
    - `Treatment`: Specifies the experimental treatment or drug applied (e.g., Doxorubicin). For combination therapies involving multiple drugs, use a plus sign (+) as a strict separator without any spaces (e.g., Doxorubicin+Cyclophosphamide); ensure no whitespace exists around the plus sign, as formats like 'Doxorubicin + Cyclophosphamide' are incorrect.
    - `Genotype`: The genetic background (e.g., CRISPR-KO).
    - `Technique`: The experimental technique used (e.g., ChIP-seq).
  - Save Path: Save the result to: `<r></r>/dda_extract.csv`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/dda_extract/`
