Task: |
  Calculate the Pearson correlation matrix for the genes in the provided expression data `benchmark/dataset/CancerSCEM/gene_expression.csv`. 

  Identify the most highly correlated gene pairs (with correlation coefficient > 0.9).
  
  Saving the result to `<r></r>/cancerscem_annotate_2.txt`.
  
  Output format requirements (for reference only):
  gene_1
  gene_2
    
  All intermediate results should be saved in `<t></t>/cancerscem_annotate_2/` directory.

Verifier:
  cancerscem_annotate_2
