Task: |
  Identify the top 100 genes that most frequently exhibit Allele-Specific Methylation (ASM) across a population of samples. 

  Given detected ASM sites across multiple biological samples `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/mock/mock_asm_sites.csv` and genomic coordinates for all genes `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/mock/mock_genes.csv`.

  For each sample, quantified the number of ASM sites within each gene body and its $3~\mathrm{kb}$ upstream region. The frequency of genes covered by ASM was then aggregated across all samples. 
  
  Finally, identified the top 100 genes with the highest ASM frequency, and save the result into a csv file `<r></r>/asmdb_annotate.csv`

  Output example for reference:
  gene_id,frequency
  GENE_1,15
  GENE_2,14
  GENE_3,13
  GENE_4,12
  ...

  All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/asmdb_annotate`
