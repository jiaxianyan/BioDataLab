  # Core Task
  Search PubMed for Homo sapiens spatial transcriptomics literature published between 2021/01/01 and 2021/02/01 to build a comprehensive knowledge base, specifically by executing a query that combines species identifiers ('"Homo sapiens"[Mesh] OR "human"[Title/Abstract]') with topic-specific keywords ('"spatial transcriptomics"[Title/Abstract] OR "spatially resolved transcriptomics"[Title/Abstract]'), while strictly excluding non-original research by appending 'NOT ("review"[PT] OR "editorial"[PT] OR "comment"[PT] OR "letter"[PT])'. Filter the collected datasets based on the following criteria: (i) availability of raw sequencing files; (ii) presence of spatial location information or image files.

  # Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: JSON list of objects. The list must include all articles obtained from the initial PubMed search.
  - Each object must contain exactly two fields:
    - `"PMID"`: PubMed ID as a string
    - `"Accepted"`: Boolean value (`true` if the article meets all inclusion and filtering criteria, `false` otherwise)
  - Save Path: Save the complete list to: `<r></r>/crost_retrieval.json`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `<t></t>/crost_retrieval/`

  # Output Example (For Reference Only)
