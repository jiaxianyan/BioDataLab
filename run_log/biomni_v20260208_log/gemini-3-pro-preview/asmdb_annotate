The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\nImport file: assistant.tool_biodatalab.support_tools\n====================================================\nMethod: read_function_source_code\n  Description: Read the source code of a function from any module path.\n  Required Parameters:\n    - function_name (str): Fully qualified function name (e.g., 'bioagentos.tool.support_tools.write_python_code') [Default: None]\n\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module.

[ ] Inspect the input files `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/mock/mock_asm_sites.csv` and `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/mock/mock_genes.csv` to understand their structure and column names.\n3.  [ ] Process the gene file to define the region of interest for each gene (Gene Body + 3kb upstream).\n4.  [ ] Map the ASM sites to these gene regions. For each sample, count how many ASM sites fall within each gene's extended region. Actually, the prompt says \"The frequency of genes covered by ASM was then aggregated across all samples.\" This usually means counting in how many samples a gene has at least one ASM site, or simply the total number of ASM sites per gene across all samples. Let's re-read carefully: \"For each sample, quantified the number of ASM sites within each gene body and its 3 kb upstream region. The frequency of genes covered by ASM was then aggregated across all samples.\" This phrasing is slightly ambiguous. It could mean:\n    *   Sum of ASM site counts per gene across all samples.\n    *   Count of samples where the gene has > 0 ASM sites (Frequency of *occurrence*).\n    *   Let's look at the output example: `gene_id, frequency`. If the values are like 15, 14, 13, and there are many samples, it might be the number of samples. If the values are huge, it's total sites. Given \"frequency of genes covered by ASM\", it strongly suggests \"number of samples in which the gene shows ASM\". I will proceed with this interpretation: Count the number of samples where a gene has at least one ASM site in its defined region.\n5.  [ ] Aggregate the counts to get a frequency per gene.\n6.

Ah, I see the previous error was `NameError(\"name 'pd' is not defined\")`.\n\nLet me try again, being very careful.\n\n<execute> #!python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\n\n# Define paths\nasm_sites_path = 'benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/mock/mock_asm_sites.csv'\ngenes_path = 'benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/mock/mock_genes.csv'\noutput_path = '/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/asmdb_annotate.csv'\ntemp_dir = '/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/asmdb_annotate'\n\n# Ensure output directory exists\nos.makedirs(os.path.dirname(output_path), exist_ok=True)\n\n# Load data\nprint(\"Loading data...\")\ntry:\n    asm_df = pd.read_csv(asm_sites_path)\n    genes_df = pd.read_csv(genes_path)\n    print(f\"Loaded {len(asm_df)} ASM sites and {len(genes_df)} genes.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error loading data: {e}\")\n    exit(1)\n\n# Define function to calculate search region\ndef get_search_region(row):\n    # 3kb upstream + gene body\n    upstream_dist = 3000\n    if row['strand'] == '+':\n        # Upstream is before start (smaller coordinate)\n        # Region: [start - 3000, end]\n        search_start = max(0, row['start'] - upstream_dist)\n        search_end = row['end']\n    elif row['strand'] == '-':\n        # Upstream is after end (larger coordinate)\n        # Region: [start, end + 3000]\n        search_start = row['start']\n        search_end = row['end'] + upstream_dist\n    else:\n        # Fallback\n        search_start = max(0, row['start'] - upstream_dist)\n        search_end = row['end']\n    return pd.Series([search_start, search_end], index=['search_start', 'search_end'])\n\n# Apply function to genes\nprint(\"Calculating gene search regions...\")\ngenes_df[['search_start', 'search_end']] = genes_df.apply(get_search_region, axis=1)\n\n# To optimize the overlap, we can process by chromosome\nprint(\"Overlapping ASM sites with genes...\")\nresults = []\n\n# Get unique chromosomes from both datasets to iterate\nchroms = set(genes_df['chrom']).union(set(asm_df['chrom']))\n\nfor chrom in chroms:\n    genes_chrom = genes_df[genes_df['chrom'] == chrom]\n    asm_chrom = asm_df[asm_df['chrom'] == chrom]\n    \n    if genes_chrom.empty:\n        continue\n    \n    if asm_chrom.empty:\n        # If there are genes but no ASM sites, they have frequency 0\n        for _, gene in genes_chrom.iterrows():\n             results.append({'gene_id': gene['gene_id'], 'frequency': 0})\n        continue\n        \n    for _, gene in genes_chrom.iterrows():\n        # Find ASM sites in range\n        in_range_mask = (asm_chrom['pos'] >= gene['search_start']) & (asm_chrom['pos'] <= gene['search_end'])\n        overlapping_asm = asm_chrom[in_range_mask]\n        \n        if not overlapping_asm.empty:\n            # Count unique samples\n            unique_samples = overlapping_asm['sample_id'].nunique()\n            results.append({\n                'gene_id': gene['gene_id'],\n                'frequency': unique_samples\n            })\n        else:\n             results.append({\n                'gene_id': gene['gene_id'],\n                'frequency': 0\n            })\n\n# Create results DataFrame\nresults_df = pd.DataFrame(results)\n\nprint(\"Aggregating and sorting...\")\n# Sort by frequency descending\nsorted_df = results_df.sort_values(by='frequency', ascending=False)\n\n# Select top 100\ntop_100 = sorted_df.head(100)\n\nprint(\"Top 5 result preview:\")\nprint(top_100.head())\n\n# Save\nprint(f\"Saving to {output_path}...\")\ntop_100.to_csv(output_path, index=False)\nprint(\"Done.\")</execute>"
