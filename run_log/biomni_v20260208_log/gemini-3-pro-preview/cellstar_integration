The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\nImport file: assistant.tool_biodatalab.support_tools\n====================================================\nMethod: read_function_source_code\n  Description: Read the source code of a function from any module path.\n  Required Parameters:\n    - function_name (str): Fully qualified function name (e.g., 'bioagentos.tool.support_tools.write_python_code') [Default: None]\n\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module.

NCBI taxonomy prefers Scientific Name usually, but common names are accepted.\n- `bladder` -> Uberon primary label is `urinary bladder`.\n- `acinic cell` -> Cell Ontology primary label is `acinar cell`.\n\nIf the user wants me to match the reference format exactly for the first two lines, I should not have changed them. But that contradicts the instruction to standardize.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, and the presence of `Rhabditis elegans` (which is scientifically incorrect for the model organism *C. elegans*), I believe the primary goal is correction/standardization. The reference output might have been a copy-paste of the input to show columns.\n\nHowever, I should double check if \"acinic cell\" is a valid label in CL. It is a synonym. \"bladder\" is a valid broad term but usually implies urinary bladder.\n\nLet's refine the standardization to be most scientifically accurate.\n- Species: `Rhabditis elegans` -> `Caenorhabditis elegans`.\n- Tissue: `multi-cellular organism` -> `whole organism` (Standard in single-cell metadata for whole body samples).\n- Tissue: `haemolymph` -> `hemolymph` (Standard spelling).\n\nThe previous execution replaced:\n- `bladder` -> `urinary bladder`\n- `acinic cell` -> `acinar cell`\n- `adipocyte` -> `fat cell`\n\nWait, `adipocyte` (CL:0000136) primary label IS `fat cell`. `adipocyte` is a synonym.\nThe reference output used `adipocyte`.\nIf I change `adipocyte` to `fat cell`, I deviate from the reference.\n\nLet's assume the Reference Output text is the \"Gold Standard\" for those specific rows.\nReference: `axolotl,bladder,acinic cell`\nReference: `African malaria mosquito,haemolymph,adipocyte`\n\nMy output:\n`axolotl,urinary bladder,acinar cell`\n`African malaria mosquito,hemolymph,fat cell`\n\nThis is quite different. The instruction \"Standardizing\" usually means mapping to the Primary Label of the ontology.\nHowever, in many single-cell datasets (like CellXGene), they might map to specific fields.\n\nLet's re-read carefully: \"Standardizing ... with taxonomy, Uberon and the Cell Ontology\".\nThis strongly suggests using the official labels. The reference output provided in the prompt looks suspicious\u2014it matches the input exactly. It is highly likely the user provided the *input* format as the \"Output format (for reference)\" by mistake, or simply meant \"This is the columns and style\". The key is the task \"Standardizing\".\n\nI will stick to the standardized primary labels (e.g., `fat cell` instead of `adipocyte`, `urinary bladder` instead of `bladder`) as that is the definition of standardization against an ontology.\n\nHowever, I will verify the generated file content one last time and perhaps make sure the \"Rhabditis elegans\" row is correct.\n\nPlan:\n1.
