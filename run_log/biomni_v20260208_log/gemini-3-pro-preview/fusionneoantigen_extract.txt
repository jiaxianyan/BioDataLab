# Core Task
Search the PubMed database for downloadable literature published between 2010/01/01 and 2025/01/01 to identify studies focused on BCR-ABL1 fusion gene neoantigens. The search should be executed using a comprehensive query string: ("BCR-ABL1"[All Fields] OR "BCR-ABL"[All Fields] OR "BCR/ABL"[All Fields]) AND ("neoantigen"[All Fields] OR "neo-antigen"[All Fields] OR "neoepitope"[All Fields] OR "tumor specific antigen"[All Fields]). Following the retrieval, carefully analyze the full text or abstracts of each article to verify that it provides an extensive discussion of neoantigens specifically derived from the BCR-ABL1 fusion event, filtering out studies where these terms appear only incidentally.

# Output Requirements & File Path
- Output format: JSON list of objects. The list must include all articles obtained from the initial PMC search.
- Each object must contain exactly two fields:
  - `"PMID"`: PubMed ID as a string.
  - `"Accepted"`: Boolean value (`true` if the article confirms research on BCR-ABL1 fusion neoantigens, `false` otherwise).
- Save Path: Save the complete list to: `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/fusionneoantigen_extract.json`
- Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/fusionneoantigen_extract/`

# Output Example (For Reference Only)

  {
    "PMID": "40459423",
    "Accepted": false
  },
  {
    "PMID": "35456656",

]

I will start by creating the necessary directories and setting up the search using Biopython.

1. [ ] Create directories and setup Biopython Entrez search.
2. [ ] Fetch abstracts for the search results.
3. [ ] Analyze abstracts to filter for relevant studies.
4. [ ] Save the final JSON output.

Step 1: Create directories and setup Biopython Entrez search.

<execute>

output_file = os.path.join(output_dir, "fusionneoantigen_extract.json")

# Create directories
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
os.makedirs(temp_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Setup Entrez
Entrez.email = "assistant@biomni.com"  # Good practice to provide an email

# Define the search query
query = '("BCR-ABL1"[All Fields] OR "BCR-ABL"[All Fields] OR "BCR/ABL"[All Fields]) AND ("neoantigen"[All Fields] OR "neo-antigen"[All Fields] OR "neoepitope"[All Fields] OR "tumor specific antigen"[All Fields]) AND ("2010/01/01"[Date - Publication] : "2025/01/01"[Date - Publication])'

print(f"Query: {query}")

# Perform the search
try:
    handle = Entrez.esearch(db="pubmed", term=query, retmax=100) # retmax 100 should be sufficient for this specific query, likely not thousands of hits.
    record = Entrez.read(handle)
    handle.close()
    
    id_list = record["IdList"]
    print(f"Found {len(id_list)} articles.")
    print(f"IDs: {id_list}")
    
    # Save IDs to temp file
    with open(os.path.join(temp_dir, "search_ids.json"), "w") as f:
        json.dump(id_list, f)

AB  - BCR-ABL kinase is the major oncogenic driver of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). 
      Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which are highly potent in targeting BCR-ABL, 
      are currently used as first-line treatment. Although TKIs are effective, drug 
      resistance caused by the emergence of drug-selected secondary mutations in 
      BCR-ABL remains a major problem for relapse, especially in patients with compound 
      mutations. In this study, we aimed to investigate potential neoepitopes derived 
      from mutated BCR-ABL and to generate neoepitope-specific TCRs for adoptive T cell 
      therapy. Two candidate peptides derived from the E255V and the T315I mutation 
      (designated ABL-E255V and ABL-T315I) were selected for study based on their in 
      silico predicted binding affinity to HLA-A2. By immunizing transgenic mice that 
      express a diverse human T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire restricted to HLA-A2, we 
      detected CD8+ T cell responses against the ABL-E255V, but not the ABL-T315I 
      peptide. From immune responding mice, two E255V-specific TCRs were isolated. 
      Human CD8+ T cells were engineered to express the specific TCRs for 
      characterization, in which one TCR was identified as a therapeutic candidate due 
      to its superior avidity and lack of detectable off-target reactivity. 
      Importantly, we demonstrated that the ABL-E255V neoepitope was naturally 
      processed and presented. In summary, our results demonstrate that HLA-A2(+) CML 
      cells harboring the E255V mutation can be targeted by specific TCRs, which may 
      benefit patients who are highly resistant to available TKIs due to compound 
      mutations.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to explore the application of interaction-dependent 
      fucosyl-biotinylation (FucoID), a chemical biology-based proximity labeling 
      technique, in capturing tumor antigen-specific T cells and its clinical value in 
      chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) . Methods: Flow cytometry and fluorescence 
      microscopy were employed to evaluate the experimental parameters for FucoID in 
      CML. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 14 newly diagnosed CML patients 
      in the chronic phase. These samples underwent flow cytometry-based sorting and 
      were subsequently labeled with FucoID to facilitate the isolation of tumor cells 
      and T cells, followed by the immunophenotypic identification of tumor 
      antigen-specific T cells. Finally, the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of 
      FucoID in CML was assessed. Results: Initially, the experimental parameters for 
      FucoID in CML were established. The proportion of CD3(+) T cells in patients was 
      (8.96+/-6.47) %, exhibiting a marked decrease compared with that in healthy 
      individuals at (38.89+/-22.62) %. The proportion of tumor-specific antigen-reactive 
      T cells was (3.34+/-4.49) %, which demonstrated interpatient variability. In 
      addition, the proportion of tumor-specific antigen-active T cells in CD4(+) T 
      cells was (3.95+/-1.72) %, which was generally lower than the proportion in CD8(+) 
      T cells at (5.68+/-2.18) %. Compared with those in tumor-specific 
      antigen-nonreactive T cells, CCR7(-)CD45RA(-) effector memory T cells and 
      CCR7(-)CD45RA(+) effector T cells were highly enriched in tumor-specific 
      antigen-reactive T cells. Moreover, the intensity of tumor immune reactivity in 
      patients exhibited a significant correlation with white blood cell count (WBC) 
      and hemoglobin (HGB) levels in peripheral blood, while no such correlation was 
      observed with other clinical baseline characteristics. Conclusion: The 
      combination of FucoID and flow cytometry enables the rapid identification and 
      isolation of tumor antigen-specific T cells in CML. The successful application of 
      this method in CML and the implications of our findings suggest its potential 
      clinical value in the field of hematologic malignancies.

Title: Neoantigens in Hematologic Malignancies.

Abstract: T cell cancer neoantigens are created from peptides derived from cancer-specific  aberrant proteins, such as mutated and fusion proteins, presented in complex with  human leukocyte antigens on the cancer cell surface. Because expression of the  aberrant target protein is exclusive to malignant cells, immunotherapy directed  against neoantigens should avoid "on-target, off-tumor" toxicity.

Title: BCR-ABL-specific CD4(+) T-helper cells promote the priming of antigen-specific  cytotoxic T cells via dendritic cells.

Abstract: The advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy markedly improved the  outcome of patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However,  the poor prognosis of patients with advanced-phase CML and the lifelong  dependency on TKIs are remaining challenges; therefore, an effective therapeutic  has been sought. The BCR-ABL p210 fusion protein's junction region represents a  leukemia-specific neoantigen and is thus an attractive target for  antigen-specific T-cell immunotherapy. ...

I will evaluate the abstracts to determine which articles meet the criteria and create the final list.

Based on the abstracts:
1.  **PMID 39931057**: "T cell receptors specific for an imatinib-induced mutation in BCR-ABL for adoptive T cell therapy." - Discusses neoepitopes derived from mutated BCR-ABL (E255V, T315I). This fits the criteria of neoantigens derived from BCR-ABL1 fusion/mutation events. Accepted.
2.  **PMID 37749032**: "Application and clinical significance of intercellular proximity labeling technique in chronic myelogenous leukemia". - Mentions "tumor antigen-specific T cells" but focuses on a technique (FucoID) to capture them. It doesn't explicitly discuss *BCR-ABL1 fusion* neoantigens as the primary subject of discussion or target characterization in the abstract, but rather uses CML as a model. However, CML's primary antigen is BCR-ABL. Let's look closer. "capturing tumor antigen-specific T cells... in CML". It doesn't explicitly confirm the antigen is BCR-ABL fusion derived in the abstract text provided, just "tumor antigen". However, given the context of CML, it's highly likely. But the strict criteria is "extensive discussion of neoantigens specifically derived from the BCR-ABL1 fusion event". This paper seems more about the *method* of isolation. Let's look at the others first. Wait, checking the other paper (28153834) suggests targeting junction sequences is a known strategy. This paper (37749032) might be too methodological. Let's mark it False for now unless I see strong evidence in the title/abstract. The abstract says "tumor-specific antigen-reactive T cells" without naming BCR-ABL. I will mark it False as it seems to be a method paper using CML as a model, not a study *on* BCR-ABL neoantigens themselves.
3.  **PMID 32117272**: "Neoantigens in Hematologic Malignancies." - Review article. Mentions "mutated and fusion proteins". Likely discusses BCR-ABL as a classic example. "The efficacy of neoantigen vaccines...". The abstract is general. I need to be careful. Is it a study *focused* on them? "carefully analyze... to verify that it provides an extensive discussion... filtering out studies where these terms appear only incidentally." As a review of hematologic malignancies, it likely discusses BCR-ABL, but is it the *focus*? Probably a section. I will check if I can see more content or make a judgment. Usually, reviews covering the topic are accepted if they discuss it substantially. However, compared to 39931057 (specific TCRs for BCR-ABL mutations), this is broad. The prompt asks for "studies focused on BCR-ABL1... neoantigens". A broad review might not be "focused" enough. But let's look at 28153834 and 27181332.
4.  **PMID 28153834**: "Fall of the mutants: T cells targeting BCR-ABL." - "Targeting the tumor-specific junction sequence produced by the BCR-ABL fusion... Comoli et al demonstrate... infusions of (p190)BCR-ABL neoantigen-specific T cells". This is definitely focused. Accepted.
5.  **PMID 27181332**: "BCR-ABL-specific CD4(+) T-helper cells promote the priming of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells via dendritic cells." - "The BCR-ABL p210 fusion protein's junction region represents a leukemia-specific neoantigen...". Study focuses on CD4+ T cells specific to this neoantigen. Accepted.

Re-evaluating 32117272: It is a review. "Neoantigens in Hematologic Malignancies". It likely contains a section on BCR-ABL. Does that count as "focused on"? Usually, for "studies focused on...", specific experimental papers are preferred, or reviews *specifically* on that topic. A general review of all heme malignancies might be too broad. I will mark it False to be safe, or check if I can get more info. But based on the title, it's a general review.
Re-evaluating 37749032: "Application... of intercellular proximity labeling... in CML". Focus is the technique. False.

So:
39931057: True
37749032: False (Method focused)
32117272: False (General review, likely incidental/section only)
28153834: True
27181332: True

Wait, looking at 28153834 again, it seems to be a "Commentary" or "Inside Blood" article about another paper ("Comoli et al"). The title "Fall of the mutants" suggests it discusses the findings. If it discusses the topic extensively, it is relevant. It explicitly mentions "p190 BCR-ABL neoantigen-specific T cells". I will keep it as True.
