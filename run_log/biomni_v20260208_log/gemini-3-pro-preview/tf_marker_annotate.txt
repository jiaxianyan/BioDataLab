Classify gene entries in `benchmark/dataset/TF-Marker/tf_marker_entries.json` into five categories based on their functional description. 

Read the paper conent file `benchmark/dataset/TF-Marker/paper_content.md`. 

Classify the gene based on the paper content and following rules: (i) TF: TFs, which regulate the expression of markers. For example, FOXA1 (HNF3A) is a TF involved in embryonic development which plays an important role in cancer. Studies showed that FOXA1 could regulate the expression of cell marker PLOD2 by binding to its promoters, thereby affecting the occurrence and development of lung cancer; (ii) T Marker: markers, which are regulated by TFs. For example, TF POU5F1 controls the expression of marker genes (e.g. YES1, FGF4, UTF1 and ZFP206) involved in embryonic development. These genes are defined as Tmarker; (iii) I Marker: markers, which influence the activity of TFs. For example, Marker gene CD27 could activate PRDM1 and XBP1 by binding to TF CD70 on B cells. CD27 plays a role as I Marker; (iv) TFMarker: TFs, which play roles as markers. TFMarkers are usually cell/tissue-specific TFs and used as cell markers. For example, TF GATA3 is a definitive cell marker of breast cancer; and (v) TF Pmarker: TFs, which play roles as potential markers. For example, Becker et al. (12) found that TF LGR5 was a potential marker of intestinal stem cells in human .  

Save the resulting categories list to `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/tf_marker_annotate.json`.

Output format (for reference):
[category_1, category_2, ...] 

All intermediate results should be save in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/tf_marker_annotate` directory.

First, I need to understand the structure of the input data to create an effective plan. I will inspect the `tf_marker_entries.json` file to see what information is provided for each gene entry, and I will also look at the `paper_content.md` file to understand the context.

My plan is as follows:
1. [ ] Inspect the contents of `benchmark/dataset/TF-Marker/tf_marker_entries.json` and `benchmark/dataset/TF-Marker/paper_content.md`.
2. [ ] Create a Python script to classify the entries using an LLM based on the provided rules and paper content.
3. [ ] Execute the classification and save the results in the required format.

Let's start by inspecting the files.

## ABSTRACT

Congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAMs) are rare lung abnormalities that result in cyst formation and are associated with respiratory distress in infants and malignant potential in adults. The pathogenesis of CPAMs remains unknown but data suggest disruption of the normal proximo-distal programme of airway branching and differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that adult human CPAM are lined with epithelium that retains SOX-2 and thyroid transcription factor-1 immunohistochemical markers, characteristic of the developing lung. However, RALDH-1, another key marker, is absent. This suggests a more complex aetiology for CPAM than complete focal arrest of lung development and may provide insight to the associated risk of malignancy.

## INTRODUCTION

The three-dimensional network of conducting airways is formed during the pseudoglandular phase of lung development, by branching morphogenesis. This process is controlled by temporal and spatial localisation of key genes and signalling molecules that co-ordinate to drive organ formation. The fundamental pathways used during development also have key roles in tissue haemeostasis and repair once the adult lung is formed; dysregulation of these same developmental pathways contributes to the pathogenesis of many adult diseases including emphysema, \(^{1}\)  fibrosis \(^{3}\)  and lung cancer. \(^{4}\)

Congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAMs) comprise a spectrum of lung abnormalities estimated to affect between: 1:11 000 and 1:35 000 live births. CPAMs are associated with neonatal respiratory distress, recurrent childhood pulmonary infection and, without resection, malignant potential in adults. CPAMs have traditionally been classified into types 0-4 depending on size and location of lesions present. The most common sub-types are 1  \((60\% -70\%)\) , characterised by large  \((>2\mathrm{cm})\)  intercommunicating cysts, and 2  \((15\% -20\%)\) , consisting of small  \((<2\mathrm{cm})\)  cysts and solid tissue

The high mobility group box transcription factor SOX-2, early embryogenic transcription factor thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and the retinoic acid synthesising enzyme RALDH-1 are necessary for normal patterning and development of airway branching in the mouse lung. In addition, SOX-2 overexpression in mouse has been previously found to result in cystic lesions resembling those observed in human CPAM. It is therefore hypothesised that alterations

in signalling during branching morphogenesis underlie CPAM pathogenesis. In these experimental pathology studies, we examine localisation of the proteins TTF-1, SOX-2 and RALDH-1 in lung tissue from 14 cases of type 1 and 2 cases of type 2 adult CPAM compared to normal adult lung parenchyma and embryonic (fetal) human lung.

## METHODS

Fourteen type 1 and 2 two type 2 CPAM resection specimens were obtained from the diagnostic archive of the Royal Brompton Hospital (ethics reference number 10/H0504/9). Normal adult lung tissue was obtained from the International Institute for the Advancement of Medicine (USA). Human fetal lung sections (14 weeks post conception, WPC) were provided by the Joint MRC/Wellcome Trust (099175/Z/12/Z) Human Developmental Biology Resource (www.hdbr.org). Sections of adult normal resected, CPAM and fetal human lung tissue underwent immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for SOX-2, TTF-1 and RALDH-1. Sections were incubated with primary antibody at optimised concentrations (Dako TTF clone 8G7G3/1 (M3575) at 1:500, Immune Systems. SOX-2 (GT15098) at 1:500 and Sigma ALDH1A1 (HPA002123) at 1:250) overnight at  \(4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) . Sections were then incubated with biotinylated antibody (1:50) from the VectaStain ABC kit followed by ABC reagent (1:50) and DAB substrate application. Sections were mounted in DPX and digital images were captured at  \(20\times\)  magnification using Leica Application Suite software (Leica microsystems, Milton Keynes, UK) for qualitative comparison of lung tissue sections.

## RESULTS

### SOX-2

Control embryonic lung section with primary antibody omitted shows no positive staining (figure 1A). In comparison, embryonic lung tissue shows positive SOX-2 immunostaining localised to airway epithelial cells with strong staining present in the large, proximal airways (figure 1B). SOX-2 was absent in normal adult epithelium (figure 1C) whereas positive SOX-2 staining was observed in CPAM lung tissue sections, localised to cyst-lining epithelial cells (figure 1D).

### TTF-1

Control embryonic lung section with primary antibody omitted shows no positive staining (figure 2A). TTF-1 was localised to airway

epithelial cells in embryonic lung tissue (figure 2B), but in adult sections was present in a sub-set of alveolar cells (figure 2C). In CPAM lung tissue sections, all cyst lining epithelial cells stained positively for TTF-1 (figure 2D).

Control embryonic lung section with primary antibody omitted shows no positive staining (figure 3A). Positive staining was localised to the airway epithelium in embryonic lung tissue (figure 3B). RALDH1 staining was absent in normal adult lung tissue (3K). Similarly, RALDH1 staining was absent, or only very weakly positive in CPAM lung tissue sections (figure 3C).

## DISCUSSION

This study shows that the embryonic airway epithelial cell markers SOX-2 and TTF-1 are retained in the cyst-lining epithelial cells of CPAM human lung tissue. However, localisation of

another key development protein, RALDH1, reported here for the first time, is similar to that of adult lungs. This suggests that the phenotype of CPAM epithelial cells may be more complex than complete focal arrest in development.

SOX-2, TTF-1 and RALDH1 expression in normal adult and embryonic lung tissue sections, as represented by positive IHC staining, was consistent with previous studies. [10] [11] SOX-2 is critical to cell pluripotency and self-renewal, with principal embryonic expression in the proximal airway epithelium during bronchiole development. In pseudoglandular human lungs, SOX-2 levels are high in proximal stalk epithelium (differentiating bronchioles), with low levels of SOX-2 present in the distal tip epithelium. Tip expression of SOX-2 disappears completely by 20 WPC and, as a result, involvement in peripheral alveolar development is minimal, and SOX-2 protein is absent in the adult lung. [12] However, expression was present in the cyst-lining epithelial cells of adult CPAM sections, suggesting cystic regions retain a proximal embryonic phenotype. This is supportive of previous studies by Ochieng et al demonstrating the likely role of SOX-2 overexpression in CPAM cyst development. [10]

TTF-1 expression in adult human lung tissue was localised to a sub-set of alveolar epithelial cells, presumably type II pneumocytes and absent from airway epithelium. TTF-1 is localised to all airway epithelial cells in human embryonic lungs but unlike SOX-2, there is no difference between proximal and distal airways. TTF-1 staining in cyst-lining epithelium of CPAM lung tissue more closely resembled the generalised epithelial expression of embryonic lung tissue.

RALDH1 expression was prominent in airway epithelial cells of pseudoglandular lung, whereas no staining was present in the adult lung. In CPAM lung tissue sections, some extremely weak RALDH1 staining was observed when compared with normal adult tissue but the pattern of staining did not resemble that seen in embryonic sections, suggesting that the phenotype of cyst-lining epithelium in CPAM differs from that of embryonic lung epithelium.

These findings may also be relevant to the unusual association of lung cancer developing in some CPAMs, mainly type 1 and rarely type 2.[5] Both SOX-2 and TTF-1(NK2X-1) genes are associated with tumour plasticity[4] and a decrease in expression of

genes that regulate retinoid metabolism and signalling, including RALDH1, has also been reported in non-small cell lung cancers. \(^{15}\)  Although most cancers associated with type 1 CPAMs are mucinous adenocarcinomas \(^{5}\)  and therefore negative for TTF-1, persistence of SOX-2 expression and loss of RALDH1 in the epithelial cells may have some bearing on tumour development and warrant further study.

We recognise th</observation>
The paper describes "SOX-2" and "TTF-1" (also known as NKX2-1, but referred to as TTF-1 in the paper) in the context of Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformations (CPAMs).

Key extracts from the paper:
- "Here, we demonstrate that adult human CPAM are lined with epithelium that retains SOX-2 and thyroid transcription factor-1 immunohistochemical markers, characteristic of the developing lung."
- "The high mobility group box transcription factor SOX-2, early embryogenic transcription factor thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1)..."
- "SOX-2 was absent in normal adult epithelium... whereas positive SOX-2 staining was observed in CPAM lung tissue sections, localised to cyst-lining epithelial cells."
- "TTF-1 staining in cyst-lining epithelium of CPAM lung tissue more closely resembled the generalised epithelial expression of embryonic lung tissue."

Based on the rules:
(iv) TFMarker: TFs, which play roles as markers. TFMarkers are usually cell/tissue-specific TFs and used as cell markers.

Both SOX-2 and TTF-1 are explicitly described as transcription factors ("transcription factor SOX-2", "transcription factor thyroid transcription factor-1").
The paper states they are "retained... [as] immunohistochemical markers, characteristic of the developing lung" and their presence/absence is used to characterize CPAM vs normal adult lung.
They are being used as *markers* to identify the nature of the CPAM epithelium (resembling embryonic phenotype).

Therefore, both fit the definition of "TFMarker" best. They are TFs acting as markers for the specific condition/tissue state (CPAM/embryonic lung phenotype).

Let's double check other categories:
- TF: TFs regulating markers. While they are TFs, the text focuses on them *being* markers themselves in this context, not on them regulating a specific *other* marker that is the focus of the study (though they regulate development). The rule says "TF: TFs, which regulate the expression of markers." The text says "retains SOX-2 and thyroid transcription factor-1 immunohistochemical markers".
- T Marker: markers regulated by TFs. These *are* TFs.
- I Marker: markers influencing TFs. These *are* TFs.
- TF Pmarker: TFs as *potential* markers. The paper seems quite definitive: "retains ... markers", "positive ... staining". However, let's look closer. "suggests that the phenotype ... may be more complex". But the staining is definite. Rule for TF Pmarker: "TFs, which play roles as potential markers. For example, Becker et al. (12) found that TF LGR5 was a potential marker...". Rule for TFMarker: "TF GATA3 is a definitive cell marker...". The paper uses them as established markers of "developing lung" to characterize CPAM. "immunohistochemical markers".

So "TFMarker" seems the most appropriate for both.

Let's refine the plan.
1. [x] Inspect files.
2. [ ] Write a script to categorize based on the text analysis. I can probably just write the solution directly since there are only 2 entries and the analysis is straightforward. However, the instructions ask to "Classify the gene based on the paper content and following rules" and "Save the resulting categories list to...". I should probably write a script to produce the JSON file to be safe and ensure the path is correct. I'll use a simple python script to write the JSON.

Wait, I should confirm the full list of entries. I saw `["SOX-2", "TTF-1"]`.
The task says "Classify gene entries...".
I'll create a python script that writes the classification result to the file.

Classification:
- SOX-2: TFMarker
- TTF-1: TFMarker

Reasoning:
The paper explicitly calls them "immunohistochemical markers" and notes they are transcription factors. They are used to identify the cell type/state (CPAM/embryonic).

I will construct a Python script to save the result.

I will now generate the JSON file with the classification results.

<execute>
import json
import os

# Define the output path
output_dir = "/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview"
output_file = os.path.join(output_dir, "tf_marker_annotate.json")

# Define the results based on the analysis
# Both SOX-2 and TTF-1 are Transcription Factors used as Markers in the paper.
results = ["TFMarker", "TFMarker"]

# Save the results
with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(results, f)

print(f"Results saved to {output_file}")</execute>
<observation>Results saved to /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/tf_marker_annotate.json
</observation>
I have completed the task. The classification was based on the provided paper content which identified SOX-2 and TTF-1 as transcription factors acting as markers ("TFMarker").

I'll double check the output format one last time.
"Output format (for reference): [category_1, category_2, ...]"
My code used `json.dump(["TFMarker", "TFMarker"], f)`, which produces `["TFMarker", "TFMarker"]`. This matches the format.

I'll verify the file content.
