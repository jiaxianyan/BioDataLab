# Core Task
Search the GWAS Catalog to identify and integrate GWAS datasets and corresponding articles with keywords "Atrial Fibrillation" that are published in 2025, roughly extracting some dataset details.

# Output Requirements & File Path
- Output format: A CSV file with the following columns (exactly matching the ground truth CSV headers). Use "N/A" for missing values.
  - `PMID`: The PubMed ID of the associated publication.
  - `Accession`: The unique identifier of the dataset (e.g., GCST number).
- Save Path: Save the result to: `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/pharmgwas_extract.csv`
- Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/pharmgwas_extract/`

# Output Example (For Reference Only)
PMID,Accession
99999999,GCST88888888
88888888,GCST77777777

I will search the GWAS Catalog for datasets related to "Atrial Fibrillation" published in 2025 and extract the relevant details.

Here is the plan:
1. [ ] create the intermediate directory.
2. [ ] Search the GWAS Catalog using the REST API for studies related to "Atrial Fibrillation".
3. [ ] Filter the studies for those published in 2025.
4. [ ] Extract the PMID and Accession ID (GCST).
5. [ ] Save the extracted data to the specified CSV file path.

Let's start by creating the intermediate directory.

<execute> #!BASH
mkdir -p /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/pharmgwas_extract/
mkdir -p /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/</execute>

I will write a Python script to query the GWAS Catalog API for studies related to "Atrial Fibrillation", filter them for the year 2025, and extract the required information.

1. [✓] create the intermediate directory.
2. [ ] Search the GWAS Catalog using the REST API for studies related to "Atrial Fibrillation".
3. [ ] Filter the studies for those published in 2025.
4. [ ] Extract the PMID and Accession ID (GCST).
5. [ ] Save the extracted data to the specified CSV file path.

# Define the output directory
output_dir = "/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/pharmgwas_extract/"

# GWAS Catalog API endpoint
# Using the search endpoint might be more effective or the studies endpoint with filter
# Let's try to search for the trait first.
# EFO trait for Atrial Fibrillation is EFO_0000275 usually, but let's search by keyword to be safe or use the provided keyword.

# Option 1: Search studies by EFO trait.
# First, let's just try to get studies and see the structure or use the search.
# A more robust way given the task "Search ... with keywords" is to use the solr search or just iterate recent studies if possible.
# However, the standard REST API allows filtering.

# Let's try to fetch studies associated with the trait "Atrial Fibrillation".
# The API documentation suggests /studies/search/findByEfoTrait?trait={trait}
# But finding the exact trait name format is tricky.

# Let's try a broader search using the main /studies endpoint and filtering in python if the volume isn't too huge,
# OR assume the user implies using the keyword in the title/trait.

# Let's try searching for the trait "Atrial fibrillation" directly via the text search if available, or just fetch all recent studies? No, fetching all is too much.
# Let's try the `efotraits` endpoint to find the exact trait uri first?
# Actually, the task says "Search the GWAS Catalog ... with keywords 'Atrial Fibrillation'".

# Let's try querying the /studies endpoint.
# It seems the API supports `?title=Atrial Fibrillation`? No.

# Let's use the `search` endpoint if it exists or use the `gwas-api` logic.
# A common way is to query `https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/rest/api/studies` and look for filtering.
# Let's try `https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/rest/api/studies/search/findByDiseaseTrait?diseaseTrait=Atrial%20fibrillation`

Both API attempts returned a 500 error. It seems the search endpoints might be unstable or require specific headers/parameters I'm missing.
I will switch to downloading the full study dump file from the GWAS Catalog FTP site, as it is a more reliable way to get bulk data. Then I can process it locally.

1. [✓] create the intermediate directory.
2. [ ] Search the GWAS Catalog.
   - [ ] Step 2a: Download the `gwas-catalog-studies_ontology-annotation_summary.tsv` or similar summary file.
   - [ ] Step 2b: Load the file and filter for "Atrial Fibrillation".
3. [ ] Filter the studies for those published in 2025.
4. [ ] Extract the PMID and Accession ID (GCST).
5. [ ] Save the extracted data to the specified CSV file path.

<observation>Error running Bash script (exit code 8):

The download failed. It's possible the URL is incorrect or `wget` is having issues.
I will try an alternative URL for the full studies download: `https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/api/search/downloads/studies_v1.0.2.tsv` or the main download link `https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/api/search/downloads/studies`.

Let's try the standard `studies` download endpoint.

<observation>Error running Bash script (exit code 8):
</observation>
The download is consistently failing with exit code 8 (server issued an error response). This suggests the server might be blocking automated requests or the URL has changed/is temporarily unavailable.

I will try to use `curl` with a user-agent string, as sometimes simple `wget` requests are blocked. I will also try the FTP site if the API download fails. The FTP path is usually `ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gwas/releases/latest/gwas-catalog-studies_ontology-annotation_summary.tsv`.

Let's try `curl` on the API endpoint first, then the FTP.

<execute> #!BASH

else
    echo "API Download failed. Trying FTP..."

It seems the `curl` download "succeeded" but the content is an HTML error page (based on the `<!doctype html>`). This means the API endpoint is returning an error page instead of the TSV file.

I will focus on the FTP download directly, as it is usually more stable for bulk data. I'll use the specific FTP path I mentioned.

1. [✓] create the intermediate directory.
2. [ ] Search the GWAS Catalog.

Great, I have the full studies file. Now I will process this file using Python to filter for "Atrial Fibrillation" and the publication year 2025.

The columns seem to be:
`DATE ADDED TO CATALOG`, `PUBMEDID`, `FIRST AUTHOR`, `DATE`, `JOURNAL`, `LINK`, `STUDY`, `DISEASE/TRAIT`, ...

I need to extract `PUBMEDID` and `ACCESSION`. Wait, looking at the header:
`DATE ADDED TO CATALOG	PUBMEDID	FIRST AUTHOR	DATE	JOURNAL	LINK	STUDY	DISEASE/TRAIT	INITIAL SAMPLE SIZE	REPLICATION SAMPLE SIZE	PLATFORM [SNPS PASSING QC]	ASSOCIATION COUNT`

It doesn't explicitly list "ACCESSION" or "GCST". Let me check if there are more columns or if "STUDY" contains the GCST.
Usually, there is a column for "STUDY ACCESSION".
Let me check the full header line to be sure.

That is strange. The standard GWAS Catalog studies file usually has an `ACCESSION_ID` column.
Maybe the file I downloaded `gwas-catalog-studies.tsv` is an older format or a simplified version?
Let me check the `gwas-catalog-studies-download-alternative-v1.0.2.1.txt` or `gwas-catalog-download-studies-v1.0.3.1.txt` that I saw in the file list earlier. One of them might have the Accession ID.

The script successfully filtered the studies and found 13 entries for "Atrial Fibrillation" published in 2025. The result has been saved to the required path.

I'll verify the content of the saved CSV file to ensure it matches the format requirements.

<execute> #!BASH
head -n 5 /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/pharmgwas_extract.csv</execute>
