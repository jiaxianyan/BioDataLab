# Core Task
You are a specialized Bioinformatics expert in Python, the BioPython library, and the NCBI Entrez API. Your goal is to execute precise data mining and sequence processing tasks with high rigor and error handling. You must adhere strictly to the user's filtering criteria and output specifications to ensure data integrity for downstream biological analysis. Extract and filter human antibody-related protein sequences from the NCBI Protein database and export them into a structured FASTA file.

# Workflow Instructions
- `Database Query`: Use the Bio.Entrez module to search the protein database. Construct a query using the following keywords: "antibody", "antibodies", "immunoglobulin", "scfv", or "bcr". Apply these keywords across all fields.
- `Exclusion Filtering (Keyword-based)`: Remove any entries containing the terms "nanobody" or "nanobodies" to prevent the inclusion of humanized nanobodies in the heavy chain dataset.
- `Length Filtering`: Filter sequences longer than 1000 amino acids or shorter than 70 are also removed.
- `Sampling & Ranking:`: Identify the most relevant hits based on the search relevance score. Cap the final dataset at a maximum of 10,000 unique hit sequences.

# Output Requirements & File Path
- Output format: Generate a final output in FASTA format. Each entry must include: Header: "Hit ID" and "Description"; Body: The full protein sequence. 
- Save Path: Save the result to: `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/antibody_seq_retrieval.fasta`

# Intermediate Results
All intermediate files generated should be saved in the directly `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/plabdab_retrieval`

To accomplish the task of extracting and processing human antibody-related protein sequences, I will follow a structured plan involving directory setup, database querying, data fetching, filtering, and final export.

Here is the plan:
1.  [ ] **Setup Environment**: Create the required intermediate and output directories. Import necessary libraries (Biopython).
2.  [ ] **Construct & Execute Search**: Build a robust NCBI Entrez query including keywords, organism (Homo sapiens), and relevance sorting. execute `esearch` to retrieve a list of candidate Protein IDs.
3.  [ ] **Fetch & Process Sequences**: Retrieve the protein records in batches using `efetch`.
4.  [ ] **Apply Filtering Logic**: Iterate through fetched records and apply the specific filters:
    *   **Exclusion**: Reject records with "nanobody" or "nanobodies" in the description.
    *   **Length**: Reject sequences < 70 or > 1000 amino acids.
    *   **Uniqueness**: Ensure no duplicate sequences are included.
5.  [ ] **Export Data**: Save the valid sequences (up to 10,000) to the specified FASTA file path.

I will now begin with step 1.

The task is completed. The sequences have been extracted, filtered, and saved to the specified path:
`/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/antibody_seq_retrieval.fasta`

The process involved:
1.  **Database Query**: Searched NCBI Protein for "antibody", "antibodies", "immunoglobulin", "scfv", "bcr" in "Homo sapiens".
2.  **Fetching**: Retrieved sequences in batches to ensure stability.
3.  **Filtering**:
    *   Removed entries with "nanobody" in the description.
    *   Restricted length to 70-1000 amino acids.
    *   Removed duplicate sequences.
4.  **Sampling**: Capped the final dataset at 10,000 unique sequences sorted by relevance.</solution>
