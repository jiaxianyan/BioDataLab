The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module.

The client proteins of these chaperones remain largely unknown, primarily because of the\nexceeding difficulty of determining protein-protein interactions under low-pH conditions. We developed a genetically encoded,\nhighly efficient protein photocrosslinking probe, which enabled us to profile the in vivo substrates of a major acid-protection\nchaperone, HdeA, in Escherichia coli periplasm. Among the identified HdeA client proteins, the periplasmic chaperones DegP\nand SurA were initially found to be protected by HdeA at a low pH, but they subsequently facilitated the HdeA-mediated acid\nrecovery of other client proteins. This unique, ATP-independent chaperone cooperation in the ATP-deprived E. coli periplasm\nmay support the acid resistance of enteric bacteria. The crosslinker would be valuable in unveiling the physiological interaction\npartners of any given protein and thus their functions under normal and stress conditions.\nPreserving the integrity and homeostasis of proteins under amino acids, has emerged as a superior strategy for the covalent\noptimal or nonoptimal conditions is fundamental for all liv- trapping of transient protein-protein interactions in vivo, which is\ning organisms.

C2 is alpha carbon.\n    *   So \"2-amino-8-oxodecanoic acid\":\n        *   C1: COOH\n        *   C2: CH(NH2)-R\n        *   C3..C10: Chain.\n        *   \"8-oxo\": Ketone at C8.\n        *   Chain length: Decanoic = 10 carbons.\n    *   Structure: HOOC-CH(NH2)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.\n    *   Let's verify the counting:\n        *   C1: COOH\n        *   C2: Alpha\n        *   C3: CH2\n        *   C4: CH2\n        *   C5: CH2\n        *   C6: CH2\n        *   C7: CH2\n        *   C8: C=O\n        *   C9: CH2\n        *   C10: CH3\n    *   SMILES: `CCC(=O)CCCCCC(N)C(=O)O` (ignoring chirality for a moment).\n    *   L-isomer is usually implied in biology. `CCC(=O)CCCCCC[C@H](N)C(=O)O`.\n    *   Wait, let's check the structure of Apicidin's AODA component to be sure.\n    *   Apicidin AODA is (S)-2-amino-8-oxodecanoic acid.\n    *   Let's check the SMILES construction:\n        *   C1 (Acid) - C2 (Alpha) - C3 - C4 - C5 - C6 - C7 - C8(=O) - C9 - C10.\n        *   Side chain from alpha carbon is: -(CH2)5-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.\n        *   Is that correct?\n        *   Decanoic acid: C1...C10.\n        *   C2 is alpha. So side chain is C3...C10.\n        *   C3, C4, C5, C6, C7 (5 carbons). C8 is ketone. C9, C10 (ethyl group).\n        *   Side chain = propyl-C(=O)-ethyl? No.\n        *   From C2 to C8 is C3-C4-C5-C6-C7 (5 methylenes).\n        *   So side chain is `-(CH2)5-C(=O)-CH2-CH3`.\n    *   Total carbons in side chain: 5 + 1 (C=O) + 2 = 8 carbons.\n    *   Alpha carbon + Carboxyl + Side chain (8) = 10 carbons. Matches \"decanoic\".\n    *   SMILES: `CCC(=O)CCCCCC[C@H](N)C(=O)O`.\n\n3.  **Final Verification**:\n    *   Abbreviation: AODA\n    *   Name: 2-amino-8-oxodecanoic acid\n    *   SMILES: `CCC(=O)CCCCCC[C@H](N)C(=O)O`\n\n4.  **Execute**:\n    *   Write the CSV for `paper_data_2228_2230.pdf`.\n    *   Finish.\n\n<execute>\n# Write result for paper_data_2228_2230.pdf\noutput_dir = \"/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/inclusive_extract_2/\"\nfile_path_2228 = os.path.join(output_dir, \"paper_data_2228_2230.csv\")\n\nwith open(file_path_2228, mode='w', newline='') as file:\n    writer = csv.writer(file, delimiter=';')\n    writer.writerow([\"ncAA abbreviation(s) used in the publication\", \"ncAA name, as mentioned in the publication\", \"ncAA SMILES notation\"])\n    writer.writerow([\"AODA\", \"2-amino-8-oxodecanoic acid\", \"CCC(=O)CCCCCC[C@H](N)C(=O)O\"])\n\nprint(f\"Created {file_path_2228}\")</execute>"
