The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\nImport file: assistant.tool_biodatalab.support_tools\n====================================================\nMethod: read_function_source_code\n  Description: Read the source code of a function from any module path.\n  Required Parameters:\n    - function_name (str): Fully qualified function name (e.g., 'bioagentos.tool.support_tools.write_python_code') [Default: None]\n\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module. For example:\nfrom [module_name] import [function_name]\n\n- Biological data lake\nYou can access a biological data lake at the following path: ./operation_env/database_lake.\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant datasets:\nEach item is listed with its description to help you understand its contents.\n----\n\n----\n\n- Software Library:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant libraries that you can use:\nEach library is listed with its description to help you understand its functionality.\n----\nrdkit: [Python Package] A collection of cheminformatics and machine learning software.\nlangchain: [Python Package] Building applications with LLMs through composability.\ntransformers:\n  [Python Package] State-of-the-art Machine Learning for Pytorch, TensorFlow, and\n  JAX.\nscikit-learn: [Python Package] Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.\nopenai: [Python Package] The OpenAI Python library.\nanthropic: [Python Package] The Anthropic Python library.\ngoogle-genai: [Python Package] Google Generative AI SDK.\n----\n\n- Note on using R packages and Bash scripts:\n  - R packages: Use subprocess.run(['Rscript', '-e', 'your R code here']) in Python, or use the #!R marker in your execute block.\n  - Bash scripts and commands: Use the #!BASH marker in your execute block for both simple commands and complex shell scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, etc.\n        "

Patients should be advised to promptly report any symptoms such as tiredness, weakness, sore throat, fever, stomatitis, malaise, or flu-like symptoms.\n\nDrug-Drug Interaction 2:\nCoadministration of efavirenz with other agents known to induce hepatotoxicity may potentiate the risk of liver injury. Efavirenz has been associated with hepatotoxicity during postmarketing use.\nThe risk of hepatic injury should be considered when efavirenz is used in combination with other agents that are potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., acetaminophen; alcohol; androgens and anabolic steroids; antituberculous agents; azole antifungal agents; ACE inhibitors; cyclosporine (high dosages); disulfiram; endothelin receptor antagonists; interferons; ketolide and macrolide antibiotics; kinase inhibitors; minocycline; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents; other HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors; proteasome inhibitors; retinoids; sulfonamides; tamoxifen; thiazolidinediones; tolvaptan; vincristine; zileuton; anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine, hydantoins, felbamate, and valproic acid; lipid-lowering medications such as fenofibrate, lomitapide, mipomersen, niacin, and statins; herbals and nutritional supplements such as black cohosh, chaparral, comfrey, DHEA, kava, pennyroyal oil, and red yeast rice). Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fever, rash, itching, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, right upper quadrant pain, dark urine, pale stools, and jaundice. Monitoring of liver function tests should occur before and during treatment, especially in patients with underlying hepatic disease (including hepatitis B or C coinfection) or marked transaminase elevations.\n\nDrug-Drug Interaction 3:\nCoadministration with inhibitors of CYP450 2C19 may increase the plasma concentrations of brivaracetam, which is partially metabolized by the isoenzyme. The risk of a clinically relevant CYP450 2C19-mediated interaction is considered to be low according to the manufacturer.\n</observation>"
