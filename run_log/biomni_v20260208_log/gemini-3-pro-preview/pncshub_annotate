Here are the first 10K characters...\nLine 22: In this report we demonstrate that SecA2 functions in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis. Furthermore, we show that SecA2 is required for the optimal secretion of superoxide dismutase (SodA) and catalase-peroxidase (KatG). Both of these proteins are synthesized without Sec signal sequences and function to detoxify reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI). This work suggests that SecA2 is part of a specialized secretion system that contributes to the virulence of M. tuberculosis by countering the oxidative attack of the host.\n  Context 20: facilitate development of new approaches for controlling tuberculosis. As in other bacterial pathogens, the exported proteins of  \\(M.\\)  tuberculosis are among the first molecules to interact with the host and we hypothesize that protein export is critical to virulence, possibly by serving to modify the hostile macrophage environment. Mycobacteria possess homologues of the Sec-pathway components but do not have obvious homologues of factors involved in the specialized types of secretion pathways referred to above (Braunstein and Belisle, 2000). However, mycobacteria are part of a developing group of Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria that share the uncommon property of possessing multiple secA genes (secA1 and secA2) in their genomes (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus gordonii, Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus anthracis) (Mazmanian et al., 2001; The Institute for Genomic Research, 2001; 2002; Bensing and Sullam, 2002; Lenz and Portnoy, 2002). We showed previously in  \\(M.\\)  smegmatis that SecA1 is an essential 'housekeeping' SecA while SecA2 is a non-essential accessory secretion factor which functions in protein export (Braunstein et al., 2001). The 'extra' SecA in these bacteria may be part of a new type of specialized secretion pathway that functions in bacterial pathogenesis. This idea is supported by the recent demonstrations that the accessory SecA in  \\(L.\\)  monocytogenes, SecA2, contributes to virulence and the accessory sec locus (secA2 and secY2) in  \\(S.\\)  gordonii exports an adhesin for platelet binding (Bensing and Sullam, 2002; Lenz and Portnoy, 2002).\n  Context 21: \n  Context 23: \n  Context 24: ## Results\nLine 119: ### KatG release is dependent on SecA2\n  Context 117: the  \\(\\Delta\\) secA2 mutant. Thus, when SecA2 is absent SodA release into the culture filtrate is reduced while SodA accumulates with the cell. These results, in combination with our prior demonstration that SecA2 functions in protein export (13), strongly argue that SodA is secreted by an unconventional protein export pathway involving SecA2.\n  Context 118: \n  Context 120: \n  Context 121: Superoxide dismutase (SodA) converts damaging superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen.

The culture filtrates produced from early growth periods (day 3) revealed that KatG release is also dependent on SecA2 (Fig. 6A). Following longer growth periods a difference in KatG release still existed but was less dramatic (Table 2). These longer growth periods correlate with the conditions used in the 2D-PAGE analysis and help explain why we did not identify KatG in our earlier analysis.\n  Context 127: Immunoblots in Fig. 6 were analysed by densitometry. The protein detected in the  \\(\\Delta\\) secA2 mutant samples was normalized to the amount of protein present in the corresponding H37Rv sample, which was defined as 1.0.\n  Context 128: \n  Context 130: \n  Context 131: ## Discussion\nLine 139: By comparing the profile of proteins secreted by H37Rv and the  \\(\\Delta\\) secA2 mutant we set out to identify secreted proteins that might explain the role of SecA2 in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis. The proteins of interest were expected to be underrepresented in the culture filtrate produced from the  \\(\\Delta\\) secA2 mutant. The majority of secreted proteins, both with and without classical signal sequences, were not affected by the absence of secA2 (Figs 5 and 6 and Table 2). Only three proteins were identified as being released in reduced amounts from the  \\(\\Delta\\) secA2 mutant: SodA, Rv0390 and KatG.\n  Context 137: In immunocompetent mice the  \\(\\Delta\\) secA2 mutant exhibited reduced growth during the first 3 weeks but persisted normally during the remainder of the infection. The complemented strain,  \\(mc^2 3116\\) , exhibited partial complementation of this attenuated phenotype, which is consistent with the phenotype being attributable to the  \\(\\Delta\\) secA2 mutation. The lack of full complementation is likely due to the fact that secA2 is not expressed from its endogenous promoter in  \\(mc^2 3116\\) . This experiment demonstrates that SecA2 contributes to growth-in-vivo prior to the onset of effective T cell immunity. Consistent with this finding, the  \\(\\Delta\\) secA2 mutant was also attenuated in SCID mice lacking T and B cells.\n  Context 138: \n  Context 140: \n  Context 141: Multiple laboratories have identified SodA as being released by M. tuberculosis, with  \\(20 - 92\\%\\)  of total SodA being reported as extracellular (Abou-Zeid et al., 1988; Andersen et al., 1991; Zhang et al., 1991; Sonnenberg and Belisle, 1997; Raynaud et al., 1998; Harth and Horwitz, 1999; Rosenkrands et al., 2000; Tullius et al., 2001). The fact that SodA (Fe-superoxide dismutase) lacks a classical signal sequence and is cytosolic in most bacteria has led to controversy regarding whether it is released by a specific secretion mechanism or cell lysis. Recently, Tullius et al. (2001) concluded that the release of SodA by M. tuberculosis was not due to a specific export mechanism. This conclusion was based on the demonstration that proteins highly expressed and stable need not be secreted to be detected in culture medium.\nLine 149: The mechanism(s) for the recognition of SodA, Rv0390 and KatG for export remains to be defined as does the role of SecA2 in the process. All of these exported proteins lack classical signal sequences for Sec dependent translocation, and there was no evidence that these proteins are subject to proteolytic processing during export. Furthermore, sequence analysis failed to reveal shared motifs that could serve as targeting sequences. However, it is important to note that identification of secretion targeting motifs by sequence analysis alone has proven difficult for other specialized secretion systems (Jarchau et al., 1994; Anderson and Schneewind, 1997).\n  Context 147: SodA by the \u0394secA2 mutant is reduced autolysis in the mutant. However, we don't favour this explanation as there was no evidence from the 2D-PAGE analysis that the two strains differ in their degree of global autolysis. A small amount of extracellular SodA was still observed in culture filtrates produced from the \u0394secA2 mutant. It remains to be determined whether this arises from a second SodA export mechanism or an undetectable small amount of autolysis that released cytosolic SodA.\n  Context 148: \n  Context 150: \n  Context 151: In terms of the function of SecA2 in export, it is possible that the protein has dual roles. One role would be for SecA2 to directly participate in the export of a specific subset of proteins, possibly ones lacking classical signal sequences. The second role would be to assist SecA1 in the export of some proteins that possess classical signal sequences. The latter activity is supported by our previous studies in M. smegmatis that showed SecA2 contributes to the export of some PhoA fusion proteins containing Sec signal sequences (two out of the three tested) and that SecA2 was not exclusively responsible for the expor</observation>"
