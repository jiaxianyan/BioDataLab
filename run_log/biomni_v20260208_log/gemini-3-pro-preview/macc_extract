The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1.

Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user.

This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag.

In this issue of the JCI, Sonveaux et al. show that human cancer \n      cells cultured under hypoxic conditions convert glucose to lactate and extrude \n      it, whereas aerobic cancer cells take up lactate via monocarboxylate transporter \n      1 (MCT1) and utilize it for oxidative phosphorylation (see the related article \n      beginning on page 3930). When MCT1 is inhibited, aerobic cancer cells take up \n      glucose rather than lactate, and hypoxic cancer cells die due to glucose \n      deprivation. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with an inhibitor of MCT1 retarded \n      tumor growth. MCT1 expression was detected exclusively in nonhypoxic regions of \n      human cancer biopsy samples, and in combination, these data suggest that MCT1 \n      inhibition holds potential as a novel cancer therapy.\nFAU - Semenza, Gregg L\nAU  - Semenza GL\nAD  - Vascular Program, Institute for Cell Engineering, Department of Pediatrics, John \n      Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA. \n      gsemenza@jhmi.edu\nLA  - eng\nGR  - N01-HV28180/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States\nGR  - P01-HL65608/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States\nGR  - P01 HL065608/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States\nGR  - N01 HV028180/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States\nGR  - R01 HL055338/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States\nGR  - P20 GM078494/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States\nGR  - R01-HL55338/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States\nGR  - P20-GM78494/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States\nPT  - Comment\nPT  - Journal Article\nPT  - Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\nDEP - 20081120\nPL  - United States\nTA  - J Clin Invest\nJT  - The Journal of clinical investigation\nJID - 7802877\nRN  - IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)\nRN  - 33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)\nRN  - 0 (Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters)\nRN  - S88TT14065 (Oxygen)\nRN  - 0 (Symporters)\nRN  - 0 (Monocarboxylate Transport Protein 1)\nSB  - IM\nCON - J Clin Invest. 2008 Dec;118(12):3930-42. doi: 10.1172/JCI36843.

Because nature and intensity of T cell responses is \n      controlled by dendritic cells (DCs), it is important to evaluate whether the \n      function of these cells can be modulated by aldosterone. In this study we show \n      that aldosterone augmented the activation of CD8(+) T cells in a DC-dependent \n      fashion. Consistently, the mineralocorticoid receptor was expressed by DCs, which \n      showed activation of MAPK pathway and secreted IL-6 and TGF-beta in response to \n      aldosterone. In addition, DCs stimulated with aldosterone impose a Th17 phenotype \n      to CD4(+) T cells, which have recently been associated with the promotion of \n      inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Accordingly, we observed that aldosterone \n      enhances the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an \n      autoimmune disease promoted by Th17 cells. In addition, blockade of the \n      mineralocorticoid receptor prevented all aldosterone effects on DCs and \n      attenuated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis development in \n      aldosterone-treated mice. Our data suggest that modulation of DC function by \n      aldosterone enhances CD8(+) T cell activation and promotes Th17-polarized immune \n      responses, which might contribute to the inflammatory damage leading to \n      hypertension and cardiovascular disease.\nFAU - Herrada, Andres A\nAU  - Herrada AA\nAD  - Millennium Nucleus on Immunology and Immunotherapy, Departamento de Genetica \n      Molecular y Microbiologia, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Pontificia \n      Universidad Catolica de Chile, Santiago, Chile.\nFAU - Contreras, Francisco J\nAU  - Contreras FJ\nFAU - Marini, Natacha P\nAU  - Marini NP\nFAU - Amador, Cristian A\nAU  - Amador CA\nFAU - Gonzalez, Pablo A\nAU  - Gonzalez PA\nFAU - Cortes, Claudia M\nAU  - Cortes CM\nFAU - Riedel, Claudia A\nAU  - Riedel CA\nFAU - Carvajal, Cristian A\nAU  - Carvajal CA\nFAU - Figueroa, Fernando\nAU  - Figueroa F\nFAU - Michea, Luis F\nAU  - Michea LF\nFAU - Fardella, Carlos E\nAU  - Fardella CE\nFAU - Kalergis, Alexis M\nAU  - Kalergis AM\nLA  - eng\nPT  - Journal Article\nPT  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't\nDEP - 20091130\nPL  - England\nTA  - J Immunol\nJT  - Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)\nJID - 2985117R\nRN  - 0 (Interleukin-17)\nRN  - 4964P6T9RB (Aldosterone)\nRN  - EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)\nSB  - IM\nMH  - Aldosterone/*immunology\nMH  - Animals\nMH  - Autoimmunity\nMH  - Blotting, Western\nMH  - CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology\nMH  - Dendritic Cells/*immunology\nMH  - Encephalomyelitis, Autoimmune, Experimental/immunology\nMH  - Female\nMH  - Interleukin-17/*immunology\nMH  - Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology\nMH  - Mice\nMH  - Mice, Inbred C57BL\nMH  - Microscopy, Confocal\nMH  - Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/immunology\nMH  - Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction\nMH  - Signal Transduction/immunology\nMH  - T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology\nEDAT- 2009/12/02 06:00\nMHDA- 2010/01/09 06:00\nCRDT- 2009/12/02 06:00\nPHST- 2009/12/02 06:00 [entrez]\nPHST- 2009/12/02 06:00 [pubmed]\nPHST- 2010/01/09 06:00 [medline]\nAID - jimmunol.0802886 [pii]\nAID - 10.4049/jimmunol.0802886 [doi]\nPST - ppublish\nSO  - J Immunol. 2010 Jan 1;184(1):191-202. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.0802886.

Glutamine is important in several key metabolic \n      processes of immune cells and enterocytes. Exogenous glutamine augments the \n      functions of lymphocytes and macrophages. Neutrophils also reportedly utilize \n      glutamine at a significant rate. Our recent studies demonstrated that glutamine \n      enhances neutrophil function. This article focuses on the effects of glutamine on \n      neutrophil function in surgical stress. Enteral glutamine administration enhanced \n      peritoneal and hepatic bacterial clearance in our rat peritonitis model. \n      Furthermore, IV glutamine supplementation improved the outcome of animals with \n      severe surgical stress. Our in vitro study revealed that supplemental glutamine \n      augmented the bacterial killing function of neutrophils from postoperative \n      patients. Glutamine increased phagocytosis of the neutrophils. In addition, \n      glutamine dose-dependently increased production of reactive oxygen intermediates \n      (ROI) by neutrophils. Thus, our studies suggest that glutamine supplementation \n      may improve bactericidal function of neutrophils by increasing both phagocytosis \n      and ROI production. In conclusion, glutamine plays an important role in \n      neutrophil function. Glutamine may be useful for the prevention, and treatment, \n      of severe infection in critical illness and trauma.\nFAU - Saito, H\nAU  - Saito H\nAD  - Surgical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.\nFAU - Furukawa, S\nAU  - Furukawa S\nFAU - Matsuda, T\nAU  - Matsuda T\nLA  - eng\nPT  - Journal Article\nPT  - Review\nPL  - United States\nTA  - JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr\nJT  - JPEN.
