Extracting the mutation sites of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) from the provided pdf file `benchmark/dataset/ViMIC/12985_2021_Article_1493.pdf`.

Saving the results into a json file `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/vimic_extract.json`.

Result format reference:
[
  "G130E",
  "L109R"
]

All intermediate results should be saved in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/vimic_extract` directory.

To extract the mutation sites of Hepatitis B virus (HBV) from the provided PDF, I will follow a systematic plan. I need to read the PDF content, identify mutation patterns (like "G130E"), filter them to ensure they are relevant to HBV as described in the paper, and finally save them in the required JSON format.

Here is my plan:

1. [ ] **Setup Directories**: Create the output directory `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview` and the intermediate directory `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/vimic_extract`.
2. [ ] **Extract Text from PDF**: Use `pdfplumber` to read the text content from `benchmark/dataset/ViMIC/12985_2021_Article_1493.pdf`.
3. [ ] **Identify Mutations**: Use Regular Expressions (Regex) to find potential mutation strings (e.g., matching patterns like `[A-Z]\d+[A-Z]`) within the extracted text. I will pay attention to context if possible to avoid false positives.
4. [ ] **Refine and Format**: Process the extracted list to remove duplicates and irrelevant matches, ensuring they look like standard amino acid mutations.
5. [ ] **Save Result**: Save the final list of mutations to `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/vimic_extract.json`.

Let's start by creating the directories.

Based on the observation, the mutations detected in the paper are clearly HBV drug-resistance mutations (DRMs). The extracted mutations are:
1.  **L180M** (frequently mentioned as rtL180M)
2.  **M204I** (mentioned as rtM204I or rtM204V/I)
3.  **M204V** (mentioned as rtM204V or rtM204V/I)
4.  **S202I** (mentioned as rtS202I)
5.  **V173L** (mentioned as rtV173L)

These mutations match the context of the paper (HBV/HDV coinfection, drug resistance). The "rt" prefix (reverse transcriptase) is often used for HBV polymerase mutations, but the request asks for the standard amino acid mutation format (e.g., "G130E"), which matches the "L180M" format.

I will formulate the final list.

1.  L180M
2.  M204I
3.  M204V
4.  S202I
5.  V173L

I will now create the final JSON file.

<execute>

I have completed the task. The extracted mutations are L180M, M204I, M204V, S202I, and V173L, which are confirmed by the text analysis of the provided PDF.

The extracted mutations have been saved to the specified JSON file.

Plan Checklist:
1. [✓] First step: Setup directories.
2. [✓] Second step: Extract text from PDF.
3. [✓] Third step: Identify mutations using Regex.
4. [✓] Fourth step: Refine and format the list.
5. [✓] Fifth step: Save result.

I will now verify the file existence one last time before providing the final answer.
