Identify the top 100 genes that most frequently exhibit Allele-Specific Methylation (ASM) across a population of samples. 

Given detected ASM sites across multiple biological samples `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/mock/mock_asm_sites.csv` and genomic coordinates for all genes `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/mock/mock_genes.csv`.

For each sample, quantified the number of ASM sites within each gene body and its $3~\mathrm{kb}$ upstream region. The frequency of genes covered by ASM was then aggregated across all samples. 

Finally, identified the top 100 genes with the highest ASM frequency, and save the result into a csv file `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/asmdb_annotate.csv`

Output example for reference:
gene_id,frequency
GENE_1,15
GENE_2,14
GENE_3,13
GENE_4,12
...

All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/asmdb_annotate`

I will start by creating a plan to solve the task.

1.  [ ] Create the working directory `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/asmdb_annotate`.
2.  [ ] Inspect the input files `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/mock/mock_asm_sites.csv` and `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/mock/mock_genes.csv` to understand their structure and column names.
3.  [ ] Process the gene file to define the region of interest for each gene (Gene Body + 3kb upstream).
4.  [ ] Map the ASM sites to these gene regions. For each sample, count how many ASM sites fall within each gene's extended region. Actually, the prompt says "The frequency of genes covered by ASM was then aggregated across all samples." This usually means counting in how many samples a gene has at least one ASM site, or simply the total number of ASM sites per gene across all samples. Let's re-read carefully: "For each sample, quantified the number of ASM sites within each gene body and its 3 kb upstream region. The frequency of genes covered by ASM was then aggregated across all samples." This phrasing is slightly ambiguous. It could mean:
    *   Sum of ASM site counts per gene across all samples.
    *   Count of samples where the gene has > 0 ASM sites (Frequency of *occurrence*).
    *   Let's look at the output example: `gene_id, frequency`. If the values are like 15, 14, 13, and there are many samples, it might be the number of samples. If the values are huge, it's total sites. Given "frequency of genes covered by ASM", it strongly suggests "number of samples in which the gene shows ASM". I will proceed with this interpretation: Count the number of samples where a gene has at least one ASM site in its defined region.
5.  [ ] Aggregate the counts to get a frequency per gene.
6.  [ ] Select the top 100 genes with the highest frequency.
7.  [ ] Save the result to `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/asmdb_annotate.csv`.

Let's refine step 4 based on the "frequency" interpretation.
Plan:
1.  [ ] Create the working directory `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/asmdb_annotate`.
2.  [ ] Inspect the first few lines of the input CSV files to identify column names.
3.  [ ] Write a Python script to:
    *   Load genes and define intervals (Start - 3000 to End).
    *   Load ASM sites.
    *   Overlap ASM sites with Gene intervals.
    *   For each gene, identify the set of unique samples that have an overlapping ASM site.
    *   Calculate the size of this set (frequency).
    *   Sort by frequency descending.
    *   Take top 100.
    *   Save to the output path.

I'll start by creating the directory and inspecting the files.

I will check the number of lines in the files to decide on the most efficient processing method.

1. [✓] Create the working directory `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/asmdb_annotate`.
2. [✓] Inspect the input files `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/mock/mock_asm_sites.csv` and `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/mock/mock_genes.csv` to understand their structure and column names.
3. [ ] Check file sizes (line counts).
4. [ ] Process the data using Python.
5. [ ] Select top 100 genes.
6. [ ] Save the result.

I am very sorry. It seems I am still having environment issues or making mistakes in the execution block context. I will explicitly import pandas again inside the block and ensure no other issues. It appears `import pandas as pd` was in the previous block but maybe not registered correctly or the block failed silently before?
