# Core Task
Analyze the provided literature to extract comprehensive plant cell marker information, ensuring that data is gathered from the main text, tables, and figure legends. For each entry, you must identify the Species (scientific name), Tissue Type, Cell Marker Name, Symbol/ID (standardized to 'AT' format), and Cell Type. Strict Data Filtering: Do not retain any records that are incomplete, ambiguous, or contain missing values (N/A); specifically, discard any markers labeled as "novel," "newly identified," "unnamed," or those lacking a confirmed 'AT' format ID. Only extract entries where all five fields are explicitly defined and valid.
Literature to analyze: `dataset/PCMDB/30923229.pdf`

# Output Requirements & File Path
- Output format: A CSV file with the following columns (exactly matching the ground truth CSV headers). Use "N/A" for missing values.
  - `Species`: The scientific name of the organism (e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana).
  - `Tissue Type`: The tissue origin of the sample (e.g., Root).
  - `Cell Marker Name`: The name of the cell marker gene or protein. 
  - `Symbol/ID`: The gene symbol or ID (standardized to 'AT' format).
  - `Cell Type`: The specific cell type associated with the marker.
- Save Path: Save the result to: `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/pcmdb_extract.csv`
- Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/pcmdb_extract/`

# Output Example (For Reference Only)
Species,Tissue Type,Cell Marker Name,Symbol/ID,Cell Type
Plantus fakeus,Leaf,FAKEMARKER1,AT9G99999,Guard cells
Plantus fakeus,Stem,MYB-FAKE,AT8G88888,Vascular cells

To ensure a systematic and accurate extraction of plant cell marker information from the specified literature, I will follow this detailed plan:

1.  [ ] **Setup & Data Loading**: Create the required intermediate and output directories. Verify the existence of the target PDF file (`dataset/PCMDB/30923229.pdf`).
2.  [ ] **PDF Text & Table Extraction**: Use `pdfplumber` to extract both raw text and structured tables from the PDF. This is crucial as marker gene lists are often presented in tabular format or supplementary lists within the text.
3.  [ ] **Data Parsing & Pattern Matching**: Analyze the extracted content to identify potential marker entries.
    *   Search for gene IDs matching the standard *Arabidopsis* locus identifier format (regex pattern `AT[1-5MC]G\d{5}`).
    *   Associate these IDs with the surrounding text to identify "Species", "Tissue Type", "Cell Marker Name", and "Cell Type".
4.  [ ] **Data Filtering & Validation**: Apply the strict exclusion criteria:
    *   Remove entries with missing values in any of the 5 required columns.
    *   Exclude markers labeled "novel", "newly identified", or "unnamed".
    *   Ensure the Symbol/ID strictly follows the 'AT' format.
5.  [ ] **Final Output Generation**: Format the validated data into the required CSV structure and save it to the specified output path.

Let's begin by setting up the environment and inspecting the PDF content.

My previous observation of the first 10,000 characters of text shows a typical scientific paper structure. The text extraction worked, but no tables were extracted by `pdfplumber` in the first pass. This is a common issue with complex PDF layouts.

I need to re-examine the strategy for extracting marker data. The initial text scan mentions "530 cell-type–specific marker genes (Brady et al., 2007)" and references supplementary datasets. However, papers often list key marker genes used for validation in the main text or in small inline tables that pdfplumber might miss as "tables" but capture as text.

Based on the text:
"In general, the UMAP clusters showed high and cluster-specific expression of marker genes. For example, cells in cluster 10..."
"We identify hundreds of genes with cell-type–specific expression..."

The text mentions "Supplemental DataSet 1" and "Supplemental DataSet 2". These are not in the PDF itself. I must rely on what is *in* the PDF. This often means figure legends or results sections describing specific genes found in specific clusters.

I will search the full extracted text for "AT" gene IDs (like AT1G... AT5G...) and the surrounding context to find pairs of GeneID + Name/Description.

Let's refine the plan:
1.  [✓] Setup & Data Loading (Locating PDF completed)
2.  [✓] **PDF Text & Table Extraction** (Completed but 0 tables found. Text saved.)
3.  [ ] **Data Parsing & Pattern Matching**:
    *   Reload the full text.
    *   Use regex to find all "ATxGxxxxx" patterns.
    *   Extract lines or sentences containing these IDs.
    *   Manually or programmatically inspect these lines to link IDs to cell types and gene names mentioned in the text (e.g., "GL2 (AT1G79840) is expressed in...").
    *   Since no tables were found, I will rely heavily on sentence parsing.
4.  [ ] **Data Filtering & Validation**: Apply strict filters.
5.  [ ] **Final Output Generation**: Save to CSV.

Let's perform the regex search first to see what we are working with.

The regex search found 17 occurrences. This is a manageable number for precise extraction.
Based on the context snippets, I can see several clear mappings:

1.  `AT1G68810` -> "ABNORMAL SHOOT 5" -> "stele" (Tissue Type) / "stele-specific"
2.  `AT4G36160` -> "VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN 2" -> "stele-specific" -> "stele" (Tissue Type)
3.  `AT1G54940` -> "GLUCURONIC ACID SUBSTITUTION OF X" (needs more context) -> "cortex" (implied by previous sentence "enriched in cortex cells (cluster 10)")
4.  `AT3G50750` (BEH1), `AT4G36780` (BEH2), `AT4G18890` (BEH3), `AT1G78700` (BEH4), `AT1G19350` (BES1), `AT1G75080` (BZR1) -> associated with "cortex cells (cluster 10)" via the "BEH gene family whose motif was specifically enriched in cortex cells". This is a good candidate, but I need to check if the text explicitly says these specific genes *are* the markers or if it's just discussing the family. "Of the six genes...".
5.  `AT3G47620` (TCP14), `AT1G69690` (TCP15) -> "expressed primarily in stele (clusters 7 and 4)".
6.  `AT4G10350` (BEARSKIN2) -> "cluster-specific expression coincided with enrichment of their binding motifs" (Context is cut off, need to check if it's hair cells).
7.  `AT2G25820`, `AT5G65130`, `AT1G36060`, `AT1G44830` -> "showed strong expression in late hair cells" (Context suggests hair cells). `AT1G36060` is named "Translucent Green".

I need to confirm the species. The title says "Arabidopsis thaliana".
I need to confirm the "Tissue Type". The paper focuses on "Root" (Title: "...in Single Root Cells of Arabidopsis thaliana").
So for all valid entries:
Species = Arabidopsis thaliana
Tissue Type = Root

Now I need to refine the "Cell Type" and "Cell Marker Name" for each ID.
The IDs found are:
- AT1G68810 (ABNORMAL SHOOT 5) -> Stele cells
- AT4G36160 (VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN 2) -> Stele cells
- AT3G50750 (BEH1) -> Cortex cells (Cluster 10)
- AT4G36780 (BEH2) -> Cortex cells
- AT4G18890 (BEH3) -> Cortex cells
- AT1G78700 (BEH4) -> Cortex cells
- AT1G19350 (BES1) -> Cortex cells
- AT1G75080 (BZR1) -> Cortex cells
- AT3G47620 (TCP14) -> Stele cells
- AT1G69690 (TCP15) -> Stele cells
- AT4G10350 (BEARSKIN2) -> Hair cells? (Need verification)
- AT1G36060 (Translucent Green) -> Late hair cells
- AT2G25820 -> Late hair cells
- AT5G65130 -> Late hair cells
- AT1G44830 -> Late hair cells

I will create a more targeted extraction script to pull sentences containing these IDs to verify the details.

Based on the refined sentence extraction, here is the confirmation of my findings:

1.  **Species**: *Arabidopsis thaliana* (from title and context).
2.  **Tissue Type**: Root (from title "Root Cells").

**Marker Candidates & Analysis:**

*   **AT1G68810**
    *   Name: ABNORMAL SHOOT 5 (ABS5)
    *   Context: "the stele-specific gene AT1G68810 (ABNORMAL SHOOT 5 ; stele; Figure 2A)"
    *   Cell Type: Stele cells (or just "Stele", which is a tissue but often treated as a cell type grouping in these papers. The text says "stele-specific gene"). The paper classifies "Stele" as a cell type in the headers ("Distinct Populations of Cortex, Endodermis, Hair, Nonhair, and Stele Cells").
    *   Status: **Keep**.

*   **AT4G36160**
    *   Name: VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN 2 (VND2)
    *   Context: "Another stele-specific gene, AT4G36160 (VASCULAR- RELATED NAC-DOMAIN 2..."
    *   Cell Type: Stele cells
    *   Status: **Keep**.

*   **AT1G54940**
    *   Name: GLUCURONIC ACID SUBSTITUTION OF X (GUX1?) - Text cuts off at "GLUCURONIC ACID SUBSTITUTION OF".
    *   Context: "enriched in cortex cells... For example, AT1G54940 (GLUCURONIC ACID SUBSTITUTION OF..."
    *   Let's check full name online or infer. Usually *GUX1*. The context says "enriched in cortex cells (cluster 10)".
    *   Wait, looking closely at the `AT3G50750` context block, the text "enriched in cortex cells (cluster 10)" is actually *before* the BEH genes listing. The snippet for `AT1G54940` is cut off.
    *   Let's re-read the specific snippet for AT1G54940: "For example, AT1G54940 (GLUCURONIC ACID SUBSTITUTION OF ... ". It doesn't explicitly link to Cortex in the *same* sentence fragment shown.
    *   However, earlier in the same block, it mentions "cortex cells (cluster 10)".
    *   Actually, let's look at the `AT1G54940` snippet again. "For example, AT1G54940 ...". The previous sentence was "Other genes, not previously implicated in root development, show tissue-specific bulk expression patterns consistent with the single cell data."
    *   This one is ambiguous without the full name and explicit link in the immediate text. I will **Discard** to be safe, or try to get more context if needed. *Decision: Discard due to incomplete name in text.*

*   **BEH Family (AT3G50750, AT4G36780, AT4G18890, AT1G78700, AT1G19350, AT1G75080)**
    *   Context: "BEH gene family whose motif was specifically enriched in cortex cells (cluster 10). Of the six genes (BEH1/AT3G50750, BEH2/AT4G36780, BEH3/AT4G18890, BEH4/AT1G78700, BES1/AT1G19350, and BZR1/AT1G75080)..."
    *   The text says the *motif* is enriched. It then says "BEH2 was the most highly expressed BZR/BEH family member across clusters". It implies expression in cortex but verifies "overlapping expression patterns for these genes across cell types".
    *   This "overlapping expression" suggests they might *not* be good specific markers for just cortex, even though the motif is enriched there. The text explicitly says "Of the six genes... double mutant analysis suggests partial functional redundancy, which agrees with our observation of overlapping expression patterns".
    *   However, if the paper claims the *motif* determines the cluster identity (Cortex), are the genes markers?
    *   The prompt asks for "Cell Marker Name". It is safer to only include if the text says "Marker X is expressed in Cell Type Y".
    *   Let's look for "BEH2 was the most highly expressed...".
    *   Actually, earlier it says "BEH gene family whose motif was specifically enriched in cortex cells". This links the family to the cell type.
    *   But strict filtering says: "Discard any markers... lacking a confirmed 'AT' format ID. Only extract entries where all five fields are explicitly defined".
    *   Is "Cortex cells" the cell type? Yes.
    *   Are these markers? They are "genes" with "overlapping expression". They might not be exclusive markers.
    *   I will **Discard** these to be safe, as the text emphasizes the *motif* enrichment rather than the gene expression specificity for the whole family, and notes overlapping expression.

*   **TCP14 (AT3G47620) and TCP15 (AT1G69690)**
    *   Context: "...TCP14 (AT3G47620) and TCP15 (AT1G69690) were expressed primarily in stele (clusters 7 and 4), although this cluster-specific expression was not statistically significant".
    *   "Not statistically significant" -> **Discard**.

*   **Late Hair Cell Markers (AT2G25820, AT5G65130, AT1G36060, AT1G44830)**
    *   Context: "...four (AT2G25820, AT5G65130, AT1G36060, and AT1G44830) ... showed strong expression in late hair cells".
    *   This looks promising.
    *   AT1G36060 is named "Translucent Green".
    *   The others don't have names in the snippet.
    *   The prompt requires "Cell Marker Name". If it's N/A, the row is discarded? "Use 'N/A' for missing values" but "Strict Data Filtering: Do not retain any records ... discard ... those lacking a confirmed 'AT' format ID. Only extract entries where all five fields are explicitly defined and valid."
    *   This is a contradiction. "Use 'N/A' for missing values" vs "Only extract entries where all five fields are explicitly defined".
    *   Usually, "Cell Marker Name" can be the Gene Symbol (e.g., ABS5). If a gene only has an ID (AT1G...), the Name is technically missing or is the ID itself.
    *   However, the prompt says "Cell Marker Name: The name of the cell marker gene or protein." AND "Symbol/ID: ... AT format".
    *   If I don't have a common name (like ABS5), I might have to skip if the prompt enforces "all five fields are explicitly defined".
    *   AT1G36060 has a name: "Translucent Green".
    *   Let's check the others. The text says "four (AT2G25820...)...". It doesn't name them.
    *   I will include **AT1G36060** (Translucent Green) for "Late hair cells".
    *   I will check if I can find names for the others in the full text.

*   **BEARSKIN2 (AT4G10350)**
    *   Context: "...BEARSKIN2 (AT4G10350), that Monocle 3 created for hair cells... cluster-specific expression coincided with enrichment of their binding motifs".
    *   It seems to link BEARSKIN2 to Hair cells.
    *   Let's verify the text about "Monocle 3 created for hair cells".
    *   "To annotate the unsupervised trajectory that Monocle 3 created for hair cells, we used... BEARSKIN2 (AT4G10350)...".
    *   This links BEARSKIN2 to the *hair cell trajectory*.
    *   Cell Type: Hair cells.
    *   Name: BEARSKIN2.
    *   Status: **Keep**.

*   **GL2 (AT1G79840)** - mentioned in my plan but not found in regex?
    *   My regex was `AT[1-5MC]G\d{5}`. `AT1G79840` fits. Why wasn't it in the top list?
    *   Ah, I only printed the first 20 contexts or so.
    *   Let's check for specific famous markers like GL2, WER, CPC, SHR, SCR.

Let's do a targeted search for "GL2", "WER", "CPC", "SHR", "SCR" to see if they appear with AT codes.

<execute>

intermediate_dir = "/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/pcmdb_extract/"

with open(text_file_path, "r") as f:
    content = f.read()

    if m in content:
        # Find the line
        start_index = content.find(m)
        start = max(0, start_index - 100)
        end = min(len(content), start_index + 100)

</observation>
The manual search for names shows they are present, but often the AT ID is not *immediately* next to them in the text (e.g., "GLABRA2 (GL2) and WEREWOLF (WER)"). The ID might be in a table or figure legend (which I have as text).

Wait, the regex search for "AT..." *should* have found them if they were present as "GL2 (AT1G79840)". Since `AT1G79840` didn't show up in my previous list of *found* IDs (I printed all matches count = 17), it means the text *does not contain the AT IDs for these common markers*.

The prompt says: "discard ... those lacking a confirmed 'AT' format ID."
So if the text says "GL2 is a marker" but does not give "AT1G79840", I must **discard** it.
This drastically reduces the list to only those explicitly linked to an ID in the text.

**Valid Candidates so far:**

1.  **AT1G68810**
    *   Name: ABNORMAL SHOOT 5 (ABS5)
    *   Tissue: Root
    *   Cell Type: Stele cells (or Stele)
    *   Sentence: "the stele-specific gene AT1G68810 (ABNORMAL SHOOT 5 ; stele; Figure 2A)"

2.  **AT4G36160**
    *   Name: VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN 2 (VND2)
    *   Tissue: Root
    *   Cell Type: Stele cells (or Stele)
    *   Sentence: "Another stele-specific gene, AT4G36160 (VASCULAR- RELATED NAC-DOMAIN 2"

3.  **AT1G36060**
    *   Name: Translucent Green
    *   Tissue: Root
    *   Cell Type: Late hair cells (or Hair cells)
    *   Sentence: "One of these, AT1G36060 (Translucent Green), regulates expression... showed strong expression in late hair cells"

4.  **AT4G10350**
    *   Name: BEARSKIN2
    *   Tissue: Root
    *   Cell Type: Hair cells
    *   Sentence: "BEARSKIN2 (AT4G10350), that Monocle 3 created for hair cells... cluster-specific expression"

Let's check if there are any others in the `ids` list that I missed.
`AT3G47620` (TCP14) and `AT1G69690` (TCP15) were "not statistically significant". Discard.
`AT3G50750` etc (BEH family) were "overlapping". Discard.

I have 4 solid entries.

Let's re-examine the text for any other IDs I might have missed because they weren't in the *first* snippet.
The regex `findall` found 17 occurrences.
The IDs found were:
1. AT1G68810 (ABS5) - **Keep**
2. AT4G36160 (VND2) - **Keep**
3. AT1G54940 (GUX1?) - Name cut off. Discard.
4. AT3G50750 (BEH1) - Overlapping. Discard.
5. AT4G36780 (BEH2) - Overlapping. Discard.
6. AT4G18890 (BEH3) - Overlapping. Discard.
7. AT1G78700 (BEH4) - Overlapping. Discard.
8. AT1G19350 (BES1) - Overlapping. Discard.
9. AT1G75080 (BZR1) - Overlapping. Discard.
10. AT3G47620 (TCP14) - Not significant. Discard.
11. AT1G69690 (TCP15) - Not significant. Discard.
12. AT4G10350 (BEARSKIN2) - **Keep**
13. AT2G25820 - No name. Discard.
14. AT5G65130 - No name. Discard.
15. AT1G36060 (Translucent Green) - **Keep**
16. AT1G44830 - No name. Discard.

Wait, looking at the counts:
Matches: 17.
My list above has 16 IDs.
One ID might be repeated or I missed one.
`AT1G36060` appeared twice in the context snippets.
So that's 16 unique IDs roughly.

Let's double check `AT1G54940`.
Snippet: "For example, AT1G54940 (GLUCURONIC ACID SUBSTITUTION OF...".
If I can find the full name in the text, I can keep it.
It says "enriched in cortex cells".
Let's find the full sentence for `AT1G54940`.

</observation>
The text is cut off by a page break "--- Page 5 ---".
"GLUCURONIC ACID SUBSTITUTION OF ... --- Page 5 ---".
It is likely "GLUCURONIC ACID SUBSTITUTION OF XYLAN 1" (GUX1).
However, since the text is broken and the full name is not explicitly available *in the parsed text*, I cannot fill the "Cell Marker Name" field with 100% certainty from the *extracted text* alone without inferring.
The prompt says: "Do not retain any records that are ... incomplete ... Only extract entries where all five fields are explicitly defined".
The name is incomplete in the extraction.
Wait, maybe the next page continues it?
"... ACID SUBSTITUTION OF --- Page 5 --- ... Figure 2 ... (A) The proportion ..."
It seems the sentence breaks and the next page starts with a Figure legend. The rest of the sentence might be on the previous page or lost in the header/footer noise.
I will check if the text continues after the header.
"GLUCURONIC ACID SUBSTITUTION OF" -> Page 5 Header -> "Figure 2...".
The sentence likely continues *after* the figure legend or in the text column.
Let's try to find "XYLAN" in the text.

<execute>
import re
import os

intermediate_dir = "/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/pcmdb_extract/"
text_file_path = os.path.join(intermediate_dir, "extracted_text.txt")

with open(text_file_path, "r") as f:
    content = f.read()

print(f"Contains 'XYLAN': {'XYLAN' in content}")
if 'XYLAN' in content:
    idx = content.find('XYLAN')
    print(content[idx-50:idx+50].replace("\n", " "))</execute>
<observation>Contains 'XYLAN': True
sandthecellandtissuetypes(solidcircles)indicated. XYLAN4), which encodes a xylan glucuronosyltransfe
</observation>
"XYLAN4" is found. "XYLAN 1" or "XYLAN1" for GUX1?
The snippet for `AT1G54940` was "GLUCURONIC ACID SUBSTITUTION OF".
If I search for "GLUCURONIC ACID SUBSTITUTION OF", maybe I can find if it connects to XYLAN elsewhere.
But the snippet showed it cutting off at the page break.
Given the strict requirements and the broken text, I will **exclude** AT1G54940 to avoid "incomplete" data.

So I have 4 confirmed entries.
1. AT1G68810 / ABNORMAL SHOOT 5 / Stele cells
2. AT4G36160 / VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN 2 / Stele cells
3. AT1G36060 / Translucent Green / Late hair cells
4. AT4G10350 / BEARSKIN2 / Hair cells

Wait, let's re-verify `AT4G10350` (BEARSKIN2).
Context: "BEARSKIN2 (AT4G10350), that Monocle 3 created for hair cells... cluster-specific expression coincided with enrichment of their binding motifs".
Does it say it *is* a marker? Or just that its motif is enriched?
"For one of these, BEARSKIN2 (AT4G10350), cluster-specific expression coincided with enrichment of their binding motifs."
It implies expression is cluster-specific (Hair cells).
So it is a marker. **Keep**.

One more check on `AT1G36060` (Translucent Green).
"One of these, AT1G36060 (Translucent Green), regulates expression... showed strong expression in late hair cells".
Explicitly states "strong expression in late hair cells". **Keep**.

One more check on `AT1G68810` (ABS5).
"stele-specific gene AT1G68810 (ABNORMAL SHOOT 5 ; stele; Figure 2A)". **Keep**.

One more check on `AT4G36160` (VND2).
"Another stele-specific gene, AT4G36160 (VASCULAR- RELATED NAC-DOMAIN 2". **Keep**.

I'm confident in these 4.

**Final Data Construction:**
Species: *Arabidopsis thaliana*
Tissue Type: Root

| Cell Marker Name | Symbol/ID | Cell Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ABNORMAL SHOOT 5 | AT1G68810 | Stele cells |
| VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN 2 | AT4G36160 | Stele cells |
| BEARSKIN2 | AT4G10350 | Hair cells |
| Translucent Green | AT1G36060 | Late hair cells |

Double check "VASCULAR- RELATED NAC-DOMAIN 2". The spacing might be "VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN 2". I will normalize the space.
Double check "ABNORMAL SHOOT 5".
Double check "Translucent Green".

I will now generate the CSV.
