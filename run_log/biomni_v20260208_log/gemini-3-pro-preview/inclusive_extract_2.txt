# Core Task
You are a specialized Bioinformatics NLP Agent acting as an expert in Chemical Biology and Genetic Code Expansion (GCE). Your core competency is the high-fidelity extraction of chemical and experimental data from scientific literature regarding non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs). You will process specific PDF publications to identify ncAAs, their nomenclature, and their corresponding chemical structures represented as SMILES notations.

# Workflow Instructions
- `Literature Processing`: Parse the provided PDF files located at `benchmark/dataset/iNClusive/`.
- `Information Extraction & Chemical Identification`:
  1) ncAA Abbreviation: Extract the short-hand abbreviation(s) for the ncAAs used in the publication. If not found, use "not available".
  2) ncAA Name: Extract the full chemical or common name as mentioned in the text. If not found, use "not available".
  3) SMILES Extraction: Identify and extract the SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) string for each corresponding ncAA. This may require cross-referencing names/structures mentioned in the text with chemical databases if the string is not explicitly provided.

# Input File Path
Input Path: `benchmark/dataset/iNClusive/` (Files: paper_data_25.pdf, paper_data_73.pdf, paper_data_249_274.pdf, paper_data_342.pdf, paper_data_2228_2230.pdf)

# Output Requirements & File Path
For each input PDF, generate a separate CSV file using a semicolon (;) as the delimiter.
Output Path: /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/inclusive_extract_2/
Naming Convention: Output filenames must match the input PDF filename (e.g., paper_data_25.pdf results in paper_data_25.csv).
Three Columns: "ncAA abbreviation(s) used in the publication", "ncAA name, as mentioned in the publication", "ncAA SMILES notation"

# Intermediate Results
All intermediate files generated should be saved in the directly `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/inclusive_extract_2`

I will begin by setting up the necessary directories and verifying the existence of the input PDF files. This ensures a clean workspace and confirms that the data is accessible before proceeding with processing.

Plan:
1. [ ] Create output directory `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/inclusive_extract_2/` and intermediate directory `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/inclusive_extract_2`.
2. [ ] List files in `benchmark/dataset/iNClusive/` to confirm the target files exist.
3. [ ] Process `paper_data_25.pdf`: Extract text, identify ncAAs, write CSV.
4. [ ] Process `paper_data_73.pdf`: Extract text, identify ncAAs, write CSV.
5. [ ] Process `paper_data_249_274.pdf`: Extract text, identify ncAAs, write CSV.
6. [ ] Process `paper_data_342.pdf`: Extract text, identify ncAAs, write CSV.
7. [ ] Process `paper_data_2228_2230.pdf`: Extract text, identify ncAAs, write CSV.

a genetically incorporated crosslinker reveals

Zengyi Chang1,4* & peng r Chen2,4,5*
Acid chaperones are essential factors in preserving the protein homeostasis for enteric pathogens to survive in the extremely
acidic mammalian stomach (pH 1–3). The client proteins of these chaperones remain largely unknown, primarily because of the
exceeding difficulty of determining protein-protein interactions under low-pH conditions. We developed a genetically encoded,
highly efficient protein photocrosslinking probe, which enabled us to profile the in vivo substrates of a major acid-protection
chaperone, HdeA, in Escherichia coli periplasm. Among the identified HdeA client proteins, the periplasmic chaperones DegP
and SurA were initially found to be protected by HdeA at a low pH, but they subsequently facilitated the HdeA-mediated acid
recovery of other client proteins. This unique, ATP-independent chaperone cooperation in the ATP-deprived E. coli periplasm
may support the acid resistance of enteric bacteria. The crosslinker would be valuable in unveiling the physiological interaction
partners of any given protein and thus their functions under normal and stress conditions.
Preserving the integrity and homeostasis of proteins under amino acids, has emerged as a superior strategy for the covalent

SH3 Domain Based Phototrapping in Living Cells
Reveals Rho Family GAP Signaling Complexes
Hirokazu Okada,1 Akiyoshi Uezu,1 Frank M. Mason,1 Erik J. Soderblom,2
M. Arthur Moseley III,2 Scott H. Soderling1*
Rho family GAPs [guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activating proteins] negatively regulate Rho
family GTPase activity and therefore modulate signaling events that control cytoskeletal dynamics.
The spatial distribution of these GAPs and their specificity toward individual GTPases are controlled
by their interactions with various proteins within signaling complexes. These interactions are likely
mediatedthroughtheSrchomology3(SH3)domain,whichisabundantintheRhofamilyGAPproteome
andexhibitsamicromolarbindingaffinity,enablingtheRhofamilyGAPstoparticipateintransientinter-

developed a domain-based proteomics approach, starting with in vivo phototrapping of SH3 domain–

cluding 51 previously unidentified ones) for nine Rho family GAPs. We constructed Rho family GAP

</observation>
Thinking Process:

1.  **Analyze the previous observation**:
    *   The `grep` for "hydroxamic" returned nothing (empty output).
    *   The `grep` for "amino acid" returned general statements about "unnatural amino acids (WUAAs)".
    *   The file `paper_data_2228_2230.pdf` discusses "custom-designed warhead-armed cyclic peptide inhibitors" and mentions "CY5-6Q" targeting HDAC8.
    *   The abstract mentions "Warhead-bearing unnatural amino acids (WUAAs)".
    *   I need to find the specific WUAA used. The abstract mentions a "K value of 15 nM" for CY5-6Q.
    *   Common warheads for HDACs are hydroxamic acids. The grep failed, but maybe the text extraction was messy or the term is hyphenated differently.

2.  **Strategy**:
    *   I will read more of the text from `paper_data_2228_2230.pdf` to identify the specific WUAA.
    *   I'll look for chemical names or specific codes associated with the "warhead".
    *   I will search for "Phe" or "Tyr" derivatives, as these are common scaffolds.
    *   The text mentioned "CY5-6Q". I'll search for the components of that.

3.  **Refined Search**:
    *   I'll read the first 5000 characters of the text file to get more context than the snippet provided earlier.
    *   I'll search for "Scheme" or "Figure" captions in the text, as these often define the chemical structures.

4.  **Execute**:
    *   Read the text file again, printing a larger chunk.
    *   Specifically look for the definition of the "warhead" amino acid.

Let's look at the text content again.

    keywords = ["warhead", "hydroxamic", "tyrosine", "phenylalanine", "lysine", "structure"]

Thinking Process:

1.  **Analyze the text**:
    *   The paper discusses HDAC inhibitors.
    *   It mentions "Apicidin is a natural cyclic peptide".
    *   It mentions "AODA lysine (AcK)" in the search results snippet: `substrate analog. In particular, AODA lysine (AcK), its co-translational incorporation was at-`.
    *   "AODA" likely stands for 2-amino-8-oxo-decanoic acid or similar, which mimics the acetyl-lysine side chain or the side chain in Apicidin.
    *   Wait, Apicidin contains 2-amino-8-oxodecanoic acid (AODA).
    *   The paper says "AODA lysine (AcK)". This is confusing. Let's look closer. "AODA" is often the ketone analog of Acetyl Lysine.
    *   Let's check if the paper introduces a *new* amino acid or uses AODA.
    *   The title mentions "Custom-Designed Warhead-Armed".
    *   Snippet: "Apicidin is a natural cyclic peptide... AODA...".
    *   Let's check if they incorporate AODA or a derivative.
    *   Let's search for "AODA" and "structure" or "smiles" context.

2.  **Refined Hypothesis**:
    *   The ncAA might be AODA (2-amino-8-oxodecanoic acid).
    *   Or it might be an analog of it.
    *   The snippet mentions "AODA lysine (AcK)". This might be a typo in the snippet or text, or it implies AODA *is* the analog of Lysine.
    *   Let's get the full sentence around "AODA".

3.  **Execute**:
    *   Print the context around "AODA".
    *   Print the context around "Figure 1" or "Scheme 1" to see if they define the structure.
    *   Search for "2-amino-8-oxodecanoic acid".

</observation>
Thinking Process:

1.  **Analyze the context**:
    *   "We chose 2-amino-8-oxodecanoic acid (AODA) as a WUAA."
    *   "AODA is a structural mimic of the physiological HDAC substrate, acetylated Lys residue..."
    *   "AODA incorporation via a genetic code expansion technique has not been reported."
    *   So the ncAA is **2-amino-8-oxodecanoic acid**.
    *   Abbreviation: **AODA**.

2.  **Determine SMILES**:
    *   Name: 2-amino-8-oxodecanoic acid.
    *   Structure: An alpha-amino acid with a side chain.
    *   Backbone: `N[C@@H](C(=O)O)`.
    *   Side chain: 8-oxodecanoic acid implies a 10-carbon chain in total (if it's decanoic acid derivative) or the position is relative to the chain.
    *   Usually, standard IUPAC: C1 is carboxyl. C2 is alpha carbon.
    *   So "2-amino-8-oxodecanoic acid":
        *   C1: COOH
        *   C2: CH(NH2)-R
        *   C3..C10: Chain.
        *   "8-oxo": Ketone at C8.
        *   Chain length: Decanoic = 10 carbons.
    *   Structure: HOOC-CH(NH2)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.
    *   Let's verify the counting:
        *   C1: COOH
        *   C2: Alpha
        *   C3: CH2
        *   C4: CH2
        *   C5: CH2
        *   C6: CH2
        *   C7: CH2
        *   C8: C=O
        *   C9: CH2
        *   C10: CH3
    *   SMILES: `CCC(=O)CCCCCC(N)C(=O)O` (ignoring chirality for a moment).
    *   L-isomer is usually implied in biology. `CCC(=O)CCCCCC[C@H](N)C(=O)O`.
    *   Wait, let's check the structure of Apicidin's AODA component to be sure.
    *   Apicidin AODA is (S)-2-amino-8-oxodecanoic acid.
    *   Let's check the SMILES construction:
        *   C1 (Acid) - C2 (Alpha) - C3 - C4 - C5 - C6 - C7 - C8(=O) - C9 - C10.
        *   Side chain from alpha carbon is: -(CH2)5-C(=O)-CH2-CH3.
        *   Is that correct?
        *   Decanoic acid: C1...C10.
        *   C2 is alpha. So side chain is C3...C10.
        *   C3, C4, C5, C6, C7 (5 carbons). C8 is ketone. C9, C10 (ethyl group).
        *   Side chain = propyl-C(=O)-ethyl? No.
        *   From C2 to C8 is C3-C4-C5-C6-C7 (5 methylenes).
        *   So side chain is `-(CH2)5-C(=O)-CH2-CH3`.
    *   Total carbons in side chain: 5 + 1 (C=O) + 2 = 8 carbons.
    *   Alpha carbon + Carboxyl + Side chain (8) = 10 carbons. Matches "decanoic".
    *   SMILES: `CCC(=O)CCCCCC[C@H](N)C(=O)O`.

3.  **Final Verification**:
    *   Abbreviation: AODA
    *   Name: 2-amino-8-oxodecanoic acid
    *   SMILES: `CCC(=O)CCCCCC[C@H](N)C(=O)O`

4.  **Execute**:
    *   Write the CSV for `paper_data_2228_2230.pdf`.
    *   Finish.
