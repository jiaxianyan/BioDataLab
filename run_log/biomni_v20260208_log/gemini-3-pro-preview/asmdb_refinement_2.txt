Process quality control and genomic mapping of the the raw sequencing data located at `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/rna_seq/SRR942022_1.fastq`.

Using fastp with default parameters.

The reference genome located at `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/ref/TAIR10_chr_all.fas`.

Converting the alignment output into BAM format and perform coordinate-based sorting.

Saving the final bam file in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/asmdb_refinement_2.bam`

All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/asmdb_refinement_2/`

I will perform quality control using `fastp` and genomic mapping using `hisat2`, followed by `samtools` for BAM conversion and sorting.

Here is the plan:
1. [ ] Create the working directory `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/asmdb_refinement_2/`.
2. [ ] Run `fastp` for quality control on the raw reads.
3. [ ] Build a `hisat2` index for the reference genome.
4. [ ] Map the cleaned reads to the reference genome using `hisat2`.
5. [ ] Convert the SAM output to BAM, sort by coordinates, and save the final result to `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/asmdb_refinement_2.bam`.

I will start by creating the directory and running `fastp`.

<execute> #!BASH
# 1. Create working directory
mkdir -p /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/asmdb_refinement_2/
mkdir -p /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/

# 2. Run fastp

I will now build the HISAT2 index for the reference genome and then map the cleaned reads to the reference.

I have successfully completed all steps in the plan.
1. [✓] Created working directory.
2. [✓] Ran fastp for quality control.
3. [✓] Built hisat2 index.
4. [✓] Mapped reads using hisat2.
5. [✓] Converted SAM to BAM, sorted, and saved the final file.

The final sorted BAM file is located at `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/asmdb_refinement_2.bam`.

The answer is <solution> /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/asmdb_refinement_2.bam </solution>
