There are a list of possible single amino acid mutations for protein in `benchmark/dataset/VarEPS/4KMN.pdb`. The mutations are as listed in file `benchmark/dataset/VarEPS/mutation_list.txt`.

Identify the most stable mutation among the list of possible mutations by saambe-3d. 

Save the most stable mutation and its corresponding ΔΔG value to `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/most_stable_mutation.txt`.

All temp data should be save in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-pro-preview/vareps_annotation`.

Output format (For Reference):
A 415 Q T

I will start by creating a plan to solve the task.

**Plan:**

1. [ ] Explore the `saambe-3d` software location and usage instructions (README or help command).
2. [ ] Check the content of the mutation list file `benchmark/dataset/VarEPS/mutation_list.txt` to understand the format.
3. [ ] Prepare the input files required for `saambe-3d`. The software likely requires a specific input format or a list of mutations.
4. [ ] Run `saambe-3d` to predict the binding free energy change (ΔΔG) for each mutation listed.
5. [ ] Parse the output of `saambe-3d` to find the mutation with the most stable ΔΔG value. Usually, a more negative ΔΔG indicates higher stability or binding affinity, but for some tools, positive means stabilization. I need to verify the sign convention for SAAMBE-3D. (Wait, standard convention is $\Delta \Delta G = \Delta G_{mut} - \Delta G_{wt}$. Negative $\Delta \Delta G$ usually means stabilizing. However, some predictors output $\Delta \Delta G_{stability} = \Delta G_{unfolded} - \Delta G_{folded}$, where positive is stabilizing. I will check the documentation or output headers.)
6. [ ] Save the most stable mutation and its ΔΔG value to `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-pro-preview/most_stable_mutation.txt`.

Let's start by exploring the `saambe-3d` directory.
