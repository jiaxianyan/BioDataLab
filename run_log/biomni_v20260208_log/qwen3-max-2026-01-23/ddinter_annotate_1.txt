Reviewing the three drug-drug interactions description in the file `benchmark/dataset/DDInter/DDI.txt` and classified them into different risk levels (Major, Moderate, Minor, and Unknown). 

Generally, Major interactions were highly clinically significant and the drug combinations should be strictly avoided; Moderate interactions may result in exacerbation of the disease of the patient and/or change in therapy; Minor interactions were minimally clinically significant and usually they do not require changes in therapy; Unknown interactions meant that the interaction description was unavailable or incomplete.

Finially, saving the classification list into file /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/qwen3-max-2026-01-23/ddinter_annotate_1.json.

Output format  (for reference):
[risk_level_1, risk_level_2, ...]

All intermediate results should be save in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/qwen3-max-2026-01-23/ddinter_annotate_1` directory.

1. [ ] Read the content of the file `benchmark/dataset/DDInter/DDI.txt` to extract the three drug-drug interaction descriptions.
2. [ ] Analyze each description and classify it into one of the four risk levels: Major, Moderate, Minor, or Unknown, based on the provided definitions.
3. [ ] Save the intermediate results (e.g., extracted descriptions and their classifications) in the directory `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/qwen3-max-2026-01-23/ddinter_annotate_1`.
4. [ ] Save the final classification list as a JSON file at `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/qwen3-max-2026-01-23/ddinter_annotate_1.json`.

<observation>Drug-Drug Interaction 1:
The concomitant use of fluphenazine and antithyroid agents may theoretically increase the risk of agranulocytosis. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown but may be related to synergistic effects as both drugs have been associated with agranulocytosis.
If these drugs must be used together, close observation and testing for evidence of granulocytopenia is recommended. Patients should be advised to promptly report any symptoms such as tiredness, weakness, sore throat, fever, stomatitis, malaise, or flu-like symptoms.

Drug-Drug Interaction 2:
Coadministration of efavirenz with other agents known to induce hepatotoxicity may potentiate the risk of liver injury. Efavirenz has been associated with hepatotoxicity during postmarketing use.
The risk of hepatic injury should be considered when efavirenz is used in combination with other agents that are potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., acetaminophen; alcohol; androgens and anabolic steroids; antituberculous agents; azole antifungal agents; ACE inhibitors; cyclosporine (high dosages); disulfiram; endothelin receptor antagonists; interferons; ketolide and macrolide antibiotics; kinase inhibitors; minocycline; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents; other HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors; proteasome inhibitors; retinoids; sulfonamides; tamoxifen; thiazolidinediones; tolvaptan; vincristine; zileuton; anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine, hydantoins, felbamate, and valproic acid; lipid-lowering medications such as fenofibrate, lomitapide, mipomersen, niacin, and statins; herbals and nutritional supplements such as black cohosh, chaparral, comfrey, DHEA, kava, pennyroyal oil, and red yeast rice). Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fever, rash, itching, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, right upper quadrant pain, dark urine, pale stools, and jaundice. Monitoring of liver function tests should occur before and during treatment, especially in patients with underlying hepatic disease (including hepatitis B or C coinfection) or marked transaminase elevations.

Drug-Drug Interaction 3:
Coadministration with inhibitors of CYP450 2C19 may increase the plasma concentrations of brivaracetam, which is partially metabolized by the isoenzyme. The risk of a clinically relevant CYP450 2C19-mediated interaction is considered to be low according to the manufacturer.

Now, I will analyze each of the three drug-drug interaction descriptions and classify them into the appropriate risk level (Major, Moderate, Minor, or Unknown) based on the provided definitions.

- **Interaction 1**: Describes a theoretical increased risk of agranulocytosis (a serious condition) with fluphenazine and antithyroid agents. It recommends close monitoring and patient education but does not state that the combination should be strictly avoided. This suggests a **Moderate** risk.
- **Interaction 2**: Describes a potential potentiation of hepatotoxicity risk when efavirenz is combined with other hepatotoxic agents. It lists many such agents and recommends monitoring and patient awareness. Given the seriousness of liver injury and the broad range of interacting drugs, this is likely **Major**.
- **Interaction 3**: States that CYP450 2C19 inhibitors may increase brivaracetam concentrations but explicitly says the risk of a clinically relevant interaction is **low**. This fits the definition of **Minor**.

I will now save these classifications and the intermediate results.
