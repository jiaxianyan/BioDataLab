# Core Task
Systematically search the PubMed database for research published between 2021/01/01 and 2021/03/01 to identify studies reporting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) involving Ciprofloxacin, acting as either the precipitant or the object drug. The search should employ keywords such as "Drug Interactions"[MeSH] or "drug-drug interaction", while strictly excluding drug-food and drug-gene interactions by filtering out terms like "Food-Drug Interactions"[MeSH Terms], "food"[Title], "Pharmacogenetics"[MeSH Terms], or "gene"[Title/Abstract]. Following the initial search, conduct a detailed abstract analysis to screen for and isolate literature that specifically focuses on clinical or pharmacological interactions between Ciprofloxacin and other pharmaceutical agents, ensuring all irrelevant topics are removed from the final collection.

# Output Requirements & File Path
- Output format: JSON list of objects. The list must include all articles obtained from the initial PubMed search.
- Each object must contain exactly two fields:
  - `"PMID"`: PubMed ID as a string
  - `"Accepted"`: Boolean value (`true` if the article meets all inclusion and filtering criteria, `false` otherwise)
- Save Path: Save the complete list to: `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/qwen3-max-2026-01-23/ddinter_retrieval.json`
- Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/qwen3-max-2026-01-23/ddinter_retrieval/`

  # Output Example (For Reference Only)
[
  {
    "PMID": "99999999",
    "Accepted": false
  },
  {
    "PMID": "88888888",
    "Accepted": true
  }
]

Each response must include thinking process followed by either <execute> or <solution> tag. But there are no tags in the current response. Please follow the instruction, fix and regenerate the response again.
I need to start by setting up the required directory structure for intermediate storage and final output. This is essential before proceeding with any data retrieval or processing.

1. [✓] Set up the required directory structure for intermediate storage and final output.  
2. [ ] Construct a PubMed search query using Entrez utilities that adheres to the specified date range, includes Ciprofloxacin and DDI-related keywords, and excludes food/gene interaction terms.  
3. [ ] Execute the PubMed search to fetch the list of PMIDs matching the query.  
4. [ ] Download the abstracts (or full metadata) for all retrieved PMIDs.  
5. [ ] Perform detailed text analysis on each abstract to determine if it specifically discusses a clinical or pharmacological drug-drug interaction involving Ciprofloxacin.  
6. [ ] Generate the final JSON list with "PMID" and "Accepted" fields based on the screening results.  
7. [ ] Save the final JSON output to the specified path and ensure all intermediate files are stored in the designated temporary directory.  

Now, I will construct a PubMed search query using Biopython's Entrez module. The query must:
- Include Ciprofloxacin as either precipitant or object drug
- Include DDI-related terms like "Drug Interactions"[MeSH] OR "drug-drug interaction"
- Exclude food/gene interactions using NOT ("Food-Drug Interactions"[MeSH Terms] OR "food"[Title] OR "Pharmacogenetics"[MeSH Terms] OR "gene"[Title/Abstract])
- Restrict publication dates to 2021/01/01–2021/03/01
