## ABSTRACT

Clinical evidence shows that following initial response to treatment, drug-resistant cancer cells frequently evolve and, eventually, most tumors become resistant to all available therapies. We compiled a focused library consisting of  \(>500\)  commercially available or newly synthesized 8-hydroxyquinoline (8OHQ) derivatives whose toxicity is paradoxically increased rather than decreased by the activity of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a transporter conferring multidrug resistance (MDR). Here, we deciphered the mechanism of action of NSC297366 that shows exceptionally strong Pgp-potentiated toxicity. Treatment of cells with NSC297366 resulted in changes associated with the activity of potent anticancer iron chelators.

## Introduction

Clinical evidence shows that, following initial response to treatment, drug-resistant cancer cells frequently evolve, and eventually most tumors become resistant to all available therapies (1). Cancer cells can escape treatment by various mechanisms. The most straightforward cause of therapy resistance is linked to cellular alterations that prevent drugs to act on their target. For example, therapies hitting cancer-specific pathways are often blunted by mutations altering the target or by the activation of compensatory pathways. Alternatively, cell-intrinsic resistance mechanisms can change the "cellular pharmacology" of the cancer cell, influencing the uptake, metabolism or the

Strikingly, iron depletion was more pronounced in MDR cells due to the Pgp-mediated efflux of NSC297366-iron complexes. Our results indicate that iron homeostasis can be targeted by MDR-selective compounds for the selective elimination of multidrug resistant cancer cells, setting the stage for a therapeutic approach to fight transporter-mediated drug resistance.

Significance: Modulation of the MDR phenotype has the potential to increase the efficacy of anticancer therapies. These findings show that the MDR transporter is a "double-edged sword" that can be turned against resistant cancer.

efflux of the drugs to reduce their concentrations below a cell-killing threshold (1, 2). Upregulation of cell membrane efflux transporters of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily leads to simultaneous resistance against structurally and functionally unrelated chemotherapeutic agents. In particular, P-glycoprotein (Pgp, MDR1), the product of ABCB1 gene, was shown to be expressed in several drug resistant malignancies, including ovarian carcinoma (3), acute myeloid leukemia (4), chronic myeloid leukemia (5), small cell lung cancer (6), and more (1, 2).

On the basis of the correlation of P-glycoprotein expression and function (7) with unfavorable treatment response, it is universally accepted that pharmacologic modulation of the multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype has the potential to significantly increase the efficacy of currently available anticancer therapies. Unfortunately, despite a few early successes, clinical trials conducted with Pgp inhibitors did not fulfill this expectation, failing to confirm clinical benefit (8). Failure of the trials led to a setback in research, and the shutdown of the pharmaceutical development of transporter inhibitors for the improvement of anticancer therapy. Yet the "transporter problem" has not vanished, as evidenced by new studies supporting the relevance and benefit of research on the role of ABC transporters in clinical drug resistance (2). For example, studies conducted with genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) mirroring many aspects of the human disease have shown that acquired resistance to docetaxel, doxorubicin, topotecan or olaparib is caused by the increased expression of the Abcb1 or Abcg2 genes, and the contribution of drug efflux to drug resistance was also confirmed in ABC transporter-deficient tumors (9).

Failure of the inhibitors has boosted research in other directions, exploring the possibility to evade efflux, or to exploit the paradoxical sensitivity associated with efflux-based drug resistance mechanisms (1). Alterations that confer selective advantage during the evolution of cancer cells might also create vulnerabilities that can be exploited therapeutically (10, 11). From this perspective, resistance can be interpreted as a trait that could be targeted by new drugs. In recent

Cserepes et al.

years we have undertaken a systematic effort to identify "MDR-selective" compounds exhibiting increased, rather than decreased toxicity against MDR cells. Our method, based on the correlation of toxicity profiles with Pgp expression patterns in the NCI60 cell panel, has led to the discovery of several compounds with robust, Pgp dependent toxic activity across diverse cell lines (12-15).

To date, the mechanism of Pgp potentiated toxicity of the MDR-selective compounds is not known, limiting intelligent drug design. Strikingly, MDR-selective compounds show structural coherence, highlighting chemical features that may be responsible for a common mechanism of action. In particular, there is a significant enrichment of metal chelators, indicating that metal-ion interaction could be key to the cytotoxicity of MDR-selective compounds (16, 17).

Here, we describe the relation of iron chelation to the MDR-selective toxicity of NSC297366, a compound containing an 8-hydroxyquinoline substructure possessing exceptionally strong Pgp-potentiated toxicity. We show that the toxicity of NSC297366 is linked to cellular iron depletion, which is exacerbated by Pgp.

## Materials and Methods

### Cell cultures

MES-SA, MES-SA/DX5 cells were obtained from ATCC where they were characterized by DNA fingerprinting. The ABCB1-overexpressing subline MES-SA/B1 was produced by lentiviral transduction of pRRL-EF1-ABCB1. MES-SA mCherry and MES-SA/B1 mOrange cell lines were engineered to overexpress the fluorescent protein with lentiviral transduction of pRRL-EF1 plasmids. P-glycoprotein function was characterized by the Calcein AM assay (Supplementary Fig. S2; ref. 7). Cells were periodically tested and resulted negative for Mycoplasma contamination with the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza). Cells were cultured for not more than 30 passages or 3 months after thawing. Cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with  \(10\%\)  fetal bovine serum (Gibco),  \(5\mathrm{mmol / L}\)  L-glutamine (Gibco), and  \(50~\mathrm{U / mL}\)  penicillin/streptomycin solution (Life Technologies).

### Chemicals

Doxorubicin was purchased from TEVA. NSC297366 was obtained from DTP's drug repository (NCI, NIH). Tariquidar was a kind gift from Susan Bates (NCI, NIH, Bethesda, MD). Verapamil, iron chloride, deferiprone, cobalt chloride, human holotransferrin and deferasirox were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Iron chloride, cobalt chloride and transferrin were used in aqueous solutions, all other chemicals were dissolved in DMSO.

### Cell viability assays

MTT assay was used to quantify cell viability, as described previously (14). For the drug combination tests, 384-well tissue culture plates were used. In each well, 2,500 cells were seeded in 20  \(\mu\) L medium, 1 day prior to the addition of the 2 compounds to be combined in additional  \(20 + 20~\mu \mathrm{L}\)  volumes. Fully automated pipetting steps were performed by a Hamilton StarLet liquid handling workstation. Plates were incubated for 6 days. Growth inhibition (GI) of MES-SA mCherry and MES-SA/B1 mOrange lines was assessed based on the detection of the respective fluorescent intensities scanned from the wells (585ex/610em for mCherry and 545ex/567em for mOrange). Data were normalized to negative (live cells, maximal fluorescence) and positive (dead cells, minimal fluorescence) controls.  \(\mathrm{GI}_{50}\)  values of "compound A" with the fixed

concentrations of "compound B" (and vice versa) were paired, and plotted on an equipotent graph as  \(\mathrm{GI}_{50}\)  isoboles. For each data point of the isobole, signif</observation>

From the paper content, I can identify **P-glycoprotein (Pgp)** as a key biomarker. It is described as a transporter conferring multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer. The paper mentions its role in drug resistance across various malignancies, including ovarian carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, and small cell lung cancer.

Now, I will extract the required fields:
- **biomarkerName**: Pgp (abbreviation for P-glycoprotein)
- **biomarkerType**: Protein (since P-glycoprotein is a protein transporter)
- **curated_disease_name**: Multidrug-resistant cancer (as the paper discusses MDR in various cancers)
- **biomarkerUsage**: Therapeutic (since the paper explores targeting Pgp for therapeutic intervention against drug-resistant cancer)

I will now save this information into the specified CSV file.
