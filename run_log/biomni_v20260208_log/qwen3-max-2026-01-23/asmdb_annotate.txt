Identify the top 100 genes that most frequently exhibit Allele-Specific Methylation (ASM) across a population of samples. 

Given detected ASM sites across multiple biological samples `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/mock/mock_asm_sites.csv` and genomic coordinates for all genes `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/mock/mock_genes.csv`.

For each sample, quantified the number of ASM sites within each gene body and its $3~\mathrm{kb}$ upstream region. The frequency of genes covered by ASM was then aggregated across all samples. 

Finally, identified the top 100 genes with the highest ASM frequency, and save the result into a csv file `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/qwen3-max-2026-01-23/asmdb_annotate.csv`

Output example for reference:

1. [✓] Created the temporary directory for intermediate files.
2. [✓] Reloaded the ASM sites and gene coordinates from the provided CSV files.
3. [✓] Preprocessed the data to ensure genomic coordinates are in a consistent format and added 3 kb upstream regions.
4. [✓] For each sample, counted the number of ASM sites that fall within each gene body or its 3 kb upstream region.
5. [✓] Aggregated the counts across all samples to compute the frequency of ASM coverage per gene.
6. [✓] Identified the top 100 genes with the highest ASM frequency.
7. [✓] Saved the result to the specified output CSV file and ensured intermediate files are stored in the designated temporary directory.

The task has been completed successfully. The top 100 genes with the highest ASM frequency have been identified and saved to the required output file.

<solution> The top 100 genes exhibiting the highest frequency of Allele-Specific Methylation (ASM) across samples have been identified and saved to `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/qwen3-max-2026-01-23/asmdb_annotate.csv`.
