# Core Task
Extract comprehensive sample metadata from the GSE210066 Series, including identifiers (Sample ID, Project ID), biological context (Sample type, Tissue, Disease), and technical details (Platform, RNA Source). Furthermore, carefully analyze the data to determine the total number of high-quality cells successfully captured (#Cell) and the Median UMI count for each sample.

# Output Requirements & File Path
- Output format: A CSV file with the following columns (exactly matching the ground truth CSV headers). Use "N/A" for missing values.
  - `Sample ID`: The unique identifier for the sample (e.g., GSM number).
  - `Project ID`: The project identifier (e.g., GSE number).
  - `Sample type`: The type of sample (e.g., tumor tissue).
  - `Tissue`: The tissue of origin (e.g., liver).
  - `Disease`: The disease condition (e.g., intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma).
  - `Platform`: The sequencing platform used (e.g., 10x5').
  - `RNA Source`: The source of RNA (e.g., cell).
  - `#Cell`: The total number of high-quality cells.
  - `Median UMI`: The median Unique Molecular Identifier count.
- Save Path: Save the result to: `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/qwen3-max-2026-01-23/disco_extract.csv`
- Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/qwen3-max-2026-01-23/disco_extract/`

Isolation of live cells was performed using MACS LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec).  Library was performed according to the manufacter’s instructions (single cell 10x 5’ version 1 protocol, 10x Genomics). Briefly, cell suspensions were combined with master mix and loaded into the chip with gel beads to generate the gel bead-in-emulsion (GEM), which contains an Ilumina R1 primer sequence, Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) and the 10x Barcode. Reverse transcription was performed on the poly-A RNA within each GEM. The pooled barcoded cDNA was then cleaned up with Silane DynaBeads and amplified by PCR. To prepare libraries from cDNA, SPRIselect beads were used to isolate the correct size fragments.

The task has been completed to the best extent possible given the constraints. Comprehensive sample metadata was successfully extracted from the GSE210066 series. However, attempts to download the supplementary barcodes files (needed for #Cell and Median UMI counts) failed due to FTP access issues. As per the instructions, "N/A" has been used for these missing values.
