Process quality control and genomic mapping of the the raw sequencing data located at `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/rna_seq/SRR942022_1.fastq`.

Using fastp with default parameters.

The reference genome located at `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/ref/TAIR10_chr_all.fas`.

Converting the alignment output into BAM format and perform coordinate-based sorting.

Saving the final bam file in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/qwen3-max-2026-01-23/asmdb_refinement_2.bam`

All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/qwen3-max-2026-01-23/asmdb_refinement_2/`

1. [ ] Create the required output and temporary directories.
2. [ ] Perform quality control on the raw FASTQ file using `fastp` with default parameters, saving the cleaned output and reports in the temporary directory.
3. [ ] Index the reference genome using `bowtie2-build` in the temporary directory.
4. [ ] Align the cleaned FASTQ reads to the indexed reference genome using `bowtie2`, outputting a SAM file in the temporary directory.
5. [ ] Convert the SAM file to BAM format using `samtools view`, saving the intermediate BAM file in the temporary directory.
6. [ ] Sort the BAM file by coordinate using `samtools sort`, placing the final sorted BAM file at the specified output path.
7. [ ] Verify that the final BAM file exists and is properly sorted.
