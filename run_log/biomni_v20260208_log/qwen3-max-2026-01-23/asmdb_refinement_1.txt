Identify candidate genomic sites for Allele-Specific Methylation (ASM) analysis.

You are provided with a BED file containing methylation information for individual cytosine sites `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/toy_bed/mini_test.bed`. Your task is to filter this dataset to retain only "partially methylated" sites which serve as valid candidates for haplotype-dependent ASM identification. 

Retain only the sites with intermediate methylation levels (0.1 <= Methylation Level <= 0.9).

Saving the filtered bed file in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/qwen3-max-2026-01-23/asmdb_refinement_1.bed`

All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/qwen3-max-2026-01-23/asmdb_refinement_1/`

1. [ ] Read the BED file located at `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/toy_bed/mini_test.bed`.
2. [ ] Filter the rows to retain only those with methylation levels between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive).
3. [ ] Save the filtered data as a new BED file at `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/qwen3-max-2026-01-23/asmdb_refinement_1.bed`.
4. [ ] Ensure all intermediate files and temporary results are stored in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/qwen3-max-2026-01-23/asmdb_refinement_1/`.

1. [✓] Read the BED file located at `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/toy_bed/mini_test.bed`.
2. [✗] Filter the rows to retain only those with methylation levels between 0.1 and 0.9 (inclusive). (Failed because the methylation level is represented as a percentage in column 5, so the correct range should be 10–90, but we need to confirm the actual data format.)

From the observation, column 5 appears to represent methylation levels as percentages (e.g., "100" for 100%). To retain sites with intermediate methylation (0.1 ≤ Methylation Level ≤ 0.9), we need to filter for values between 10 and 90 (inclusive). The previous attempt was correct in using this range, but we should verify the filtering worked properly.

1. [✓] Read the BED file located at `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/toy_bed/mini_test.bed`.
2. [ ] Filter the rows to retain only those with methylation levels between 10 and 90 (inclusive).
3. [ ] Save the filtered data as a new BED file at `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/qwen3-max-2026-01-23/asmdb_refinement_1.bed`.
4. [ ] Ensure all intermediate files and temporary results are stored in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/qwen3-max-2026-01-23/asmdb_refinement_1/`.
