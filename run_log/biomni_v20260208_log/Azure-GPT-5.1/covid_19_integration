The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\nImport file: assistant.tool_biodatalab.support_tools\n====================================================\nMethod: read_function_source_code\n  Description: Read the source code of a function from any module path.\n  Required Parameters:\n    - function_name (str): Fully qualified function name (e.g., 'bioagentos.tool.support_tools.write_python_code') [Default: None]\n\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module.

[ ] Identify Affymetrix-based samples and filter expression matrices accordingly\n6. [ ] Map probe IDs to HGNC Gene Symbols and aggregate probes per gene\n7. [ ] Merge gene-level matrices from both datasets into unified matrix\n8. [ ] Save final standardized matrix to target CSV path and log summary\n\nExplanation of the issue:\n- The code attempted to read the series_matrix files from:\n  - `./operation_env/database_lake/benchmark/dataset/COVID-19/GSE153428`\n  - `./operation_env/database_lake/benchmark/dataset/COVID-19/GSE154769`\n- The environment returned:\n  - `WARNING: directory not found: ./operation_env/database_lake/benchmark/dataset/COVID-19/GSE153428`\n  - `WARNING: directory not found: ./operation_env/database_lake/benchmark/dataset/COVID-19/GSE154769`\n- As a result, no series_matrix files were discovered, and the downstream steps operated on empty lists, producing an empty matrix with 0 genes and 0 samples. The file at  \n  `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_pred_results/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/covid_19_integration.csv` currently contains only an empty header (no genes, no samples).\n\nWhat is needed to proceed correctly:\n- Access to the actual GEO attachment directories that you referenced:\n  - `benchmark/dataset/COVID-19/GSE153428`\n  - `benchmark/dataset/COVID-19/GSE154769`\n- In this environment, the data lake is rooted at `./operation_env/database_lake/`, but those subdirectories are not present or not mounted under that path.\n\nOnce the correct directories are available under the environment (for example, if they are placed at:\n- `./operation_env/database_lake/benchmark/dataset/COVID-19/GSE153428`\n- `./operation_env/database_lake/benchmark/dataset/COVID-19/GSE154769`\n\nthe pipeline will:\n1. Find `*_series_matrix.txt` / `*_series_matrix.txt.gz` files in each GSE directory.\n2. Parse the expression tables (probes \u00d7 GSM samples).\n3. Restrict to Affymetrix microarray samples if mixed platforms are present (using platform info or probe ID patterns).\n4. Map probe IDs to HGNC gene symbols (using the mapping from the platform annotation; my earlier heuristic placeholder would be replaced by a real mapping based on GPL annotation).\n5. Aggregate multiple probes per gene by averaging.\n6. Merge the two GSE-level matrices into a single gene \u00d7 sample matrix.\n7. Save the final matrix (rows = HGNC symbols, columns = GSM accessions) to:\n   - temporary: `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_tmp/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/covid_19_integration/covid_19_integration_raw_matrix.csv`\n   - final: `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_pred_results/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/covid_19_integration.csv`\n\nBecause the required directories/files are not present in the current environment, I cannot complete the requested processing step. If you can ensure that:\n\n- `benchmark/dataset/COVID-19/GSE153428`\n- `benchmark/dataset/COVID-19/GSE154769`\n\nare made available under `./operation_env/database_lake/` in this environment (with the series_matrix files inside), I can rerun the pipeline to generate the correct integrated expression matrix.  \n</solution>"
