The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\nImport file: assistant.tool_biodatalab.support_tools\n====================================================\nMethod: read_function_source_code\n  Description: Read the source code of a function from any module path.\n  Required Parameters:\n    - function_name (str): Fully qualified function name (e.g., 'bioagentos.tool.support_tools.write_python_code') [Default: None]\n\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module.

[ ] Re-orient and re-run analysis with correct responder labels  \n\nThe initial run failed logically because:\n\n- The file `benchmark/dataset/ClinicalOmicsDB/expression_data.csv` is **gene-by-sample**:\n  - Rows: 51 (first column is `\"gene\"`, 50 gene rows)\n  - Columns: `\"gene\", \"Sample_1\", ..., \"Sample_20\"`\n- There is **no explicit phenotype/response column** in this file.\n- My prior code tried to auto-detect a response column and mistakenly chose `\"Sample_1\"` as a **label column**, which is actually a **sample expression column**.  \n- As a result, only 1 \"valid sample\" was retained (n=1), so the Wilcoxon tests and AUROC were not meaningful (all NaN).\n\nTo do what you requested (Wilcoxon and AUROC between \"responder\" and \"non-responder\"), we need:\n\n- A vector of **labels per sample** (length = number of samples, i.e., 20 here), with each sample labeled as responder (1) or non-responder (0).\n- The current file only contains expression values; it does not encode the responder/non-responder status of each sample.\n\nBecause the response labels are missing from the provided data, I **cannot** correctly perform:\n\n- The Wilcoxon rank-sum test per gene (needs groups defined by response status).\n- The AUROC calculation per gene (needs binary labels per sample).\n\nWhat I can say about the current output:\n\n- The file `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_pred_results/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/clinicalomicsdb_annotate.csv` now exists but is **not valid** for your intended analysis; it reflects tests done with an incorrect label definition and effectively no groups.\n- Intermediate files in `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_tmp/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/clinicalomicsdb_annotate` are similarly based on that mistaken assumption.\n\nTo proceed correctly, I need one of the following:\n\n1. A separate metadata file (or description) mapping each sample to its response status, e.g.:\n\n   ```text\n   sample,response\n   Sample_1,responder\n   Sample_2,non-responder\n   ...\n   Sample_20,responder\n   ```\n\n2. Or, an explanation of how the response is encoded within the current CSV (e.g., specific rows/columns encoding the labels).\n\nOnce you provide that label information, I can:\n\n1. [ ] Read the expression matrix and the sample-level response labels.  \n2. [ ] Align labels with columns (`Sample_1`\u2013`Sample_20`).  \n3. [ ] For each gene (row), run:\n   - Wilcoxon rank-sum test of expression between responder vs non-responder samples.\n   - AUROC of expression values predicting responder vs non-responder.\n4. [ ] Save all intermediate results to  \n   `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_tmp/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/clinicalomicsdb_annotate/`  \n   and the final CSV to  \n   `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_pred_results/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/clinicalomicsdb_annotate.csv`  \n   in the requested format:\n\n   ```text\n   gene,p_value,auroc\n   GeneA,0.01,0.85\n   GeneB,0.05,0.75\n   ```\n\nPlease provide the sample-level responder/non-responder annotations (or the file that contains them), and I will re-run the analysis with the correct grouping.  \n</solution>"
