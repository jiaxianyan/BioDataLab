The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\nImport file: assistant.tool_biodatalab.support_tools\n====================================================\nMethod: read_function_source_code\n  Description: Read the source code of a function from any module path.\n  Required Parameters:\n    - function_name (str): Fully qualified function name (e.g., 'bioagentos.tool.support_tools.write_python_code') [Default: None]\n\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module.

[\u2713] Detect covalent protein\u2013ligand complexes by checking interatomic connectivity/distances between protein and ligand atoms (using RCSB covalent interaction annotations and a 2.0 \u00c5 threshold when distances are reported).\n5. [\u2713] Load the BioLiP artifact ligand list and filter out entries where the ligand is a known artifact.\n6. [\u2713] Save all intermediate results to the tmp directory as requested.\n7. [\u2713] Save the final filtered PDB ID list to cov_pdb_retrieval.json in the specified output directory.\n\nKey points about what was done:\n\n- Time window and resolution:\n  - Queried RCSB Search API for entries with:\n    - `rcsb_accession_info.initial_release_date` between `2018-10-01` and `2018-10-07`\n    - `rcsb_entry_info.resolution_combined` \u2264 2.5 \u00c5\n  - Result: 133 PDB entries (saved in `step3_pdb_ids_by_date_resolution.json` under the tmp directory).\n\n- Identification of protein\u2013ligand covalent complexes:\n  - For each of the 133 entries:\n    - Retrieved entry-level metadata from `https://data.rcsb.org/rest/v1/core/entry/{pdb_id}`.\n    - Required presence of both:\n      - `polymer_entity_ids` (protein entities)\n      - `nonpolymer_entity_ids` (ligands)\n      - If either set was empty, the structure was skipped as \u201cno protein\u2013ligand complex.\u201d\n    - Queried interaction data from `https://data.rcsb.org/rest/v1/core/entry/{pdb_id}/interactions`.\n      - Searched for interaction groups whose type contains \u201ccovalent\u201d.\n      - Within those, selected interactions with exactly two partners where one partner is a polymer (protein) and the other a non-polymer (ligand).\n      - If a numeric distance was reported and > 2.0 \u00c5, the interaction was discarded.\n      - Collected chem_comp IDs for ligand partners that met these criteria.\n  - All entries that had at least one such covalent protein\u2013ligand interaction were recorded as covalent candidates (with their ligand IDs) and saved as:\n    - `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_tmp/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/covpdb_retrieval/step4_covalent_candidates_raw.json`\n\n- BioLiP artifact ligand filtering:\n  - Inspected `benchmark/dataset/CovPDB/ligand_list` for artifact files.\n    - Directory exists but contained no files in this environment; thus, no artifact ligand IDs were actually loaded.\n  - The artifact ligand set was therefore empty, meaning no entries could be removed as artifacts.\n  - The (unchanged) covalent candidates list was saved as:\n    - `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_tmp/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/covpdb_retrieval/step5_covalent_candidates_filtered.json`\n\n- Final output:\n  - The final JSON file has been written to:\n    - `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_pred_results/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/cov_pdb_retrieval.json`\n  - Structure of that file:\n    - `pdb_ids`: list of unique PDB IDs that:\n      - Were released in the specified week,\n      - Have resolution \u2264 2.5 \u00c5,\n      - Contain at least one annotated covalent protein\u2013ligand interaction within the interaction report (distance \u2264 2.0 \u00c5 when available),\n      - Were not filtered out by the (here empty) BioLiP artifact list.\n    - `entries`: list of objects of the form:\n      - `{\"pdb_id\": \"XXXX\", \"ligand_ids\": [\"LIG\", \"\u2026\"]}`\n      - Only non-artifact ligands included (no change here because no artifacts were loaded).\n    - `description`: text describing the dataset.\n    - `timestamp`: UTC timestamp when the file was generated.\n\nBecause the environment cannot show the whole long log in the chat, if you want to inspect exact PDB IDs or debug details, please open:\n\n- `cov_pdb_retrieval.json` for the final list, and/or\n- `step3_pdb_ids_by_date_resolution.json`, `step4_covalent_candidates_raw.json`, `step5_covalent_candidates_filtered.json` under:\n  `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_tmp/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/covpdb_retrieval`.\n\n</solution>"
