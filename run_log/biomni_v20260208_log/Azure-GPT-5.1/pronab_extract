The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\nImport file: assistant.tool_biodatalab.support_tools\n====================================================\nMethod: read_function_source_code\n  Description: Read the source code of a function from any module path.\n  Required Parameters:\n    - function_name (str): Fully qualified function name (e.g., 'bioagentos.tool.support_tools.write_python_code') [Default: None]\n\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module.

However, actually writing that file also requires filesystem access in code, which I cannot execute further without a functioning PDF parsing step in this environment\u2019s tool chain.\n\nWhat you can do on your side to complete the task:\n\n1. On a local machine (or another environment where you can install Python packages), run a script like the one I drafted previously but with `pdfplumber` installed:\n   - Install `pdfplumber` locally (`pip install pdfplumber`).\n   - Use Python to open `dataset/ProNAB/10383437.pdf`, extract text and tables, and store them in:\n     `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_tmp/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/pronab_extract/`.\n   - Inspect the extracted material to identify protein, mutations, nucleic acid, PDB ID, method, dG, and Kd.\n\n2. Based on that inspection, build rows with the exact headers:\n   - `UniProt Id`\n   - `Mutation Protein`\n   - `Nucleic Acid Name`\n   - `Type Nuc`\n   - `PBD Compelx`\n   - `Method`\n   - `dG wild(Kcal/mol)`\n   - `Kd wild(M)`\n\n3. Save the final CSV at:\n   `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_pred_results/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/pronab_extract.csv`\n\nBecause I cannot access the necessary PDF parsing library in this constrained environment, I cannot see or verify the article\u2019s contents and therefore cannot produce a truthful row-level extraction for you here. Any attempt to give concrete UniProt IDs, Kd, or dG values would necessarily be invented, which would not satisfy your requirement for literature-based extraction.\n</solution>"
