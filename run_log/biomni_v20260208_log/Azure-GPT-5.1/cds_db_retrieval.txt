# Core Task
Search the NCBI GEO database for Series published from 2019/10/01 to 2019/10/15 using the query: '(Cancer-related keywords) AND (Drug-related keywords) AND (Patient-related keywords) AND "Homo sapiens"' to collect paired pre- and post-treatment transcriptome data. The datasets must satisfy the following inclusion/exclusion criteria: (i) paired (i.e. from the same patient) pre- and posttreatment patient samples were required; (ii) for microarray data, only datasets from Affymetrix, Agilent and Illumina platforms were collected; (iii) bulk transcriptomes were collected; (iv) datasets, in which drug therapy is combined with other physical herapies, were excluded to ensure hat he perturbation is induced only by drug therapy.


# Output Requirements & File Path
- Output format: JSON list of objects. The list must include all Series obtained from the initial GEO search.
- Each object must contain exactly two fields:
  - `"Series"`: The GEO Series accession number (e.g., "GSE123456").
  - `"Accepted"`: Boolean value (`true` if the Series meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria, `false` otherwise).
- Save Path: Save the complete list to: `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_pred_results/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/cds_db_retrieval.json`
- Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_tmp/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/cds_db_retrieval/`

    "Accepted": true
