The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\nImport file: assistant.tool_biodatalab.support_tools\n====================================================\nMethod: read_function_source_code\n  Description: Read the source code of a function from any module path.\n  Required Parameters:\n    - function_name (str): Fully qualified function name (e.g., 'bioagentos.tool.support_tools.write_python_code') [Default: None]\n\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module.

[\u2717] Inspect the DDInter integration_2.txt file to understand its structure and extract the list of small-molecule drug names/IDs.  \n   - This step failed because the file is not present at the expected path:\n     `./operation_env/database_lake/benchmark/dataset/DDInter/integration_2.txt`.  \n   - Due to the missing source file, no drug identifiers could be parsed, so no actual drug entries could be annotated.\n\n2. [\u2713] Design the output schema and intermediate file layout, and create the required directories.  \n   - Created the requested directory for intermediate results:  \n     `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_tmp/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/ddinter_integration_2`  \n   - Created intermediate files (with headers only, since no drugs were available to annotate):\n     - ATC annotations:  \n       `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_tmp/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/ddinter_integration_2/atc_annotations.tsv`  \n       Header: `drug<TAB>ATC`\n     - Chemical annotations:  \n       `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_tmp/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/ddinter_integration_2/chem_annotations.tsv`  \n       Header: `drug<TAB>formula<TAB>IUPAC<TAB>InChI<TAB>InChIKey<TAB>SMILES`\n\n3. [\u2713] Implement a pipeline to annotate each drug with ATC code and basic chemical information (formula, IUPAC, InChI, InChIKey, SMILES) using available local resources/heuristics.  \n   - Implemented an `annotate_drug(drug_id)` function:\n     - Attempts to interpret `drug_id` as a SMILES string via RDKit.\n     - If RDKit parsing succeeds:\n       - Computes molecular formula (`rdMolDescriptors.CalcMolFormula`).\n       - Computes canonical SMILES (`MolToSmiles`).\n       - Attempts InChI and InChIKey (`MolToInchi`, `InchiToInchiKey`) if InChI support is available.\n       - IUPAC name is set to `N/A` (no reliable IUPAC generator in this environment).\n       - ATC is set to `N/A` (no local ATC mapping available).\n     - If parsing fails:\n       - All fields are set to `N/A`.\n   - This satisfies: \u201cIf none applicable values, using N/A\u201d.\n\n4. [\u2713] Apply the annotation pipeline to all drugs, saving intermediate results into the tmp directory.  \n   - Because the source file was missing, there were **0 drugs** to annotate:\n     - `Total drugs to annotate: 0`\n   - No data rows were appended to the intermediate TSVs beyond their headers.\n\n5. [\u2713] Assemble the final CSV in the requested format and write it to the target output path.  \n   - Constructed the final output file:  \n     `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_pred_results/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/ddinter_integration_2.csv`\n   - Header used (as requested, plus InChI explicitly):\n     ```text\n     drug,ATC,formula,IUPAC,InChI,InChIKey,SMILES\n     ```\n   - Since there were no drug records, the final CSV contains only the header line and **0 data rows**.\n\n6. [\u2713] Verify the output (basic sanity checks: row counts, spot-check some entries).  \n   - Sanity check results:\n     - Header read back from the final CSV:  \n       `['drug', 'ATC', 'formula', 'IUPAC', 'InChI', 'InChIKey', 'SMILES']`\n     - Number of data rows: `0`\n     - Preview shows only the header row.\n\nSummary / Next actions needed\n-----------------------------\n- The requested pipeline and file structure (including all intermediate files and the final CSV) have been created.\n- However, because `benchmark/dataset/DDInter/integration_2.txt` is not present in the environment at  \n  `./operation_env/database_lake/benchmark/dataset/DDInter/integration_2.txt`, the resulting CSV is header-only.\n\nTo complete the intended annotation:\n\n1. Ensure that `integration_2.txt` is available at:\n   `./operation_env/database_lake/benchmark/dataset/DDInter/integration_2.txt`\n   (or provide the correct path).\n2. Once the file is accessible, the same pipeline can be rerun:\n   - It will extract the unique drug identifiers from the file,\n   - Apply the annotation function to each,\n   - Populate the intermediate TSVs,\n   - And regenerate a populated `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_pred_results/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/ddinter_integration_2.csv`\n   in the requested format.\n\nAt present, the final file exists at the requested location but contains only the header because no input drugs could be read.\n</solution>"
