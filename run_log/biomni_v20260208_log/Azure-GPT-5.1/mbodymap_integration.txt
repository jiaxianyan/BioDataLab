Given a list NCBI GEO Sample accession number ``, identifying and filtering for paired-end 16S rRNA SRA raw sequencing data.

Saving the accession number of identifier 16S rRNA SRA raw sequencing runs to `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_pred_results/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/mbodymap_integration.json`

Output example for reference:
```
[
  "SRR1",
  "SRR2"
]
```

All temp data should be save in `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_tmp/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/mbodymap_integration`.

<solution>
1. [ ] Clarify inputs and approach
2. [ ] Discover available GEO/SRA-related tools or datasets in the environment
3. [ ] Implement logic to query/parse metadata and detect paired-end 16S rRNA runs
4. [ ] Filter runs, collect SRR accessions, and write outputs to required paths
5. [ ] Summarize what was done and how to reuse the workflow

1. [✗] Clarify inputs and approach (failed due to missing concrete input list)

- You specified: “Given a list NCBI GEO Sample accession number ``” but did not actually provide any GSM (GEO Sample) identifiers in the message.
- The downstream steps (querying SRA metadata, checking if runs are 16S rRNA paired-end, and saving SRR IDs) critically depend on knowing which GEO samples to process.
- Without the actual list of GEO Sample accession numbers, I cannot:
  - Look up associated SRA experiments/runs.
  - Determine which of those runs are paired-end 16S rRNA.
  - Produce the requested JSON file of SRR accessions.

Because of this, I cannot carry out steps 2–4 in a meaningful way on real data.

What you need to provide next

Please reply with the actual list of NCBI GEO Sample accession numbers (e.g., `["GSM1234567", "GSM2345678", ...]`) that you want processed.

Once I have that list, I will:

1. Update the plan with the real inputs.
2. Use the existing environment (no new package installs) to:
   - Map each GSM → SRA experiment(s)/run(s).
   - Identify which SRA runs are:
     - Paired-end; and
     - 16S rRNA-targeted (based on metadata such as library strategy, source, design description, amplicon region, platform, etc.).
3. Save:
   - All temporary intermediate data under  
     `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_tmp/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/mbodymap_integration`
   - The final list of SRR accessions (JSON array of strings) to  
     `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_pred_results/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.1/mbodymap_integration.json`

Because I cannot fabricate metadata or accession mappings, I must wait for your actual GEO Sample accession list to proceed with a concrete, correct output.
