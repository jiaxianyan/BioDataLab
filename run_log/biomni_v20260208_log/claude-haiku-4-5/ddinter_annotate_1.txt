Reviewing the three drug-drug interactions description in the file `benchmark/dataset/DDInter/DDI.txt` and classified them into different risk levels (Major, Moderate, Minor, and Unknown). 

Generally, Major interactions were highly clinically significant and the drug combinations should be strictly avoided; Moderate interactions may result in exacerbation of the disease of the patient and/or change in therapy; Minor interactions were minimally clinically significant and usually they do not require changes in therapy; Unknown interactions meant that the interaction description was unavailable or incomplete.

Finially, saving the classification list into file /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/claude-haiku-4-5/ddinter_annotate_1.json.

Output format  (for reference):
[risk_level_1, risk_level_2, ...]

All intermediate results should be save in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/claude-haiku-4-5/ddinter_annotate_1` directory.

I'll help you analyze the drug-drug interactions and classify them by risk level. Let me start by examining the task and creating a plan.

Drug-Drug Interaction 1:
The concomitant use of fluphenazine and antithyroid agents may theoretically increase the risk of agranulocytosis. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown but may be related to synergistic effects as both drugs have been associated with agranulocytosis.
If these drugs must be used together, close observation and testing for evidence of granulocytopenia is recommended. Patients should be advised to promptly report any symptoms such as tiredness, weakness, sore throat, fever, stomatitis, malaise, or flu-like symptoms.

Drug-Drug Interaction 2:
Coadministration of efavirenz with other agents known to induce hepatotoxicity may potentiate the risk of liver injury. Efavirenz has been associated with hepatotoxicity during postmarketing use.
The risk of hepatic injury should be considered when efavirenz is used in combination with other agents that are potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., acetaminophen; alcohol; androgens and anabolic steroids; antituberculous agents; a

Drug-Drug Interaction 1:
The concomitant use of fluphenazine and antithyroid agents may theoretically increase the risk of agranulocytosis. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown but may be related to synergistic effects as both drugs have been associated with agranulocytosis.
If these drugs must be used together, close observation and testing for evidence of granulocytopenia is recommended. Patients should be advised to promptly report any symptoms such as tiredness, weakness, sore throat, fever, stomatitis, malaise, or flu-like symptoms.

Drug-Drug Interaction 2:
Coadministration of efavirenz with other agents known to induce hepatotoxicity may potentiate the risk of liver injury. Efavirenz has been associated with hepatotoxicity during postmarketing use.
The risk of hepatic injury should be considered when efavirenz is used in combination with other agents that are potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., acetaminophen; alcohol; androgens and anabolic steroids; antituberculous agents; azole antifungal agents; ACE inhibitors; cyclosporine (high dosages); disulfiram; endothelin receptor antagonists; interferons; ketolide and macrolide antibiotics; kinase inhibitors; minocycline; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents; other HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors; proteasome inhibitors; retinoids; sulfonamides; tamoxifen; thiazolidinediones; tolvaptan; vincristine; zileuton; anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine, hydantoins, felbamate, and valproic acid; lipid-lowering medications such as fenofibrate, lomitapide, mipomersen, niacin, and statins; herbals and nutritional supplements such as black cohosh, chaparral, comfrey, DHEA, kava, pennyroyal oil, and red yeast rice). Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fever, rash, itching, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, right upper quadrant pain, dark urine, pale stools, and jaundice. Monitoring of liver function tests should occur before and during treatment, especially in patients with underlying hepatic disease (including hepatitis B or C coinfection) or marked transaminase elevations.

Drug-Drug Interaction 3:
Coadministration with inhibitors of CYP450 2C19 may increase the plasma concentrations of brivaracetam, which is partially metabolized by the isoenzyme. The risk of a clinically relevant CYP450 2C19-mediated interaction is considered to be low according to the manufacturer.

## Task Overview
Classified three drug-drug interactions from benchmark/dataset/DDInter/DDI.txt into risk levels based on clinical significance.

## Classification Criteria
- MAJOR: Highly clinically significant; drug combinations should be strictly avoided
- MODERATE: May result in disease exacerbation or therapy changes
- MINOR: Minimally clinically significant; usually no therapy changes needed
- UNKNOWN: Interaction description unavailable or incomplete

## Classification Results

### Interaction 1: Fluphenazine + Antithyroid agents
Risk Level: MAJOR

Key Findings:
- Both drugs associated with agranulocytosis (serious blood disorder)
- Mechanism: Unknown but suggests synergistic effects
- Clinical Recommendation: Close observation and testing required
- Patient Monitoring: Required for symptoms (fever, sore throat, weakness)

Rationale for MAJOR Classification:
- Agranulocytosis is a potentially life-threatening condition
- Requires close laboratory monitoring and testing
- Specific patient education and symptom monitoring needed
- High clinical significance warrants strict avoidance

---

### Interaction 2: Efavirenz + Hepatotoxic agents
Risk Level: MAJOR

Key Findings:
- Potentiates risk of liver injury/hepatotoxicity
- Efavirenz known to cause hepatotoxicity during postmarketing use
- Multiple drug combinations listed as potentially hepatotoxic
- Clinical Recommendation: Risk assessment and monitoring required
- Monitoring: Liver function tests before and during treatment
- Special Concern: Patients with underlying hepatic disease

Rationale for MAJOR Classification:
- Hepatotoxicity is a serious adverse effect
- Extensive list of drug combinations affected
- Requires comprehensive monitoring and risk assessment
- High clinical significance for patient safety

---

### Interaction 3: Brivaracetam + CYP450 2C19 inhibitors
Risk Level: MINOR

Key Findings:
- CYP450 2C19 inhibitors may increase plasma concentrations
- Brivaracetam partially metabolized by CYP450 2C19
- Manufacturer Assessment: Risk considered LOW
- Clinical Recommendation: Minimal clinical relevance
- No specific monitoring or patient education mentioned

Rationale for MINOR Classification:
- Pharmacokinetic interaction with minimal clinical effect
- Manufacturer explicitly states risk is low
- No requirement to avoid combination
- Unlikely to require therapy changes

---

## Output Files

Primary Output:
- File: /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/claude-haiku-4-5/ddinter_annotate_1.json
- Format: JSON array of risk levels
- Content: ["Major", "Major", "Minor"]

Intermediate Results:
- Directory: /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/claude-haiku-4-5/ddinter_annotate_1/
- Files:
  - classification_results.json: Classification data
  - detailed_analysis.txt: Detailed analysis of each interaction
  - SUMMARY.md: This summary document

## Methodology

1. Parsing: Extracted three drug-drug interactions from source file
2. Analysis: Evaluated each interaction for severity, clinical recommendations, monitoring requirements
3. Classification: Assigned risk levels based on clinical significance
4. Documentation: Saved results in required JSON format

## Conclusion

Successfully classified all three drug-drug interactions:
- 2 MAJOR interactions requiring strict avoidance
- 1 MINOR interaction with low clinical significance

All results have been saved to the specified output directories.
