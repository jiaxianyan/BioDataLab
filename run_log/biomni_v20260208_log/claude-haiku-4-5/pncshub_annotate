A thorough understanding of Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenesis will facilitate the development of new treatments for tuberculosis. Numerous bacterial pathogens possess specialized protein secretion systems that are dedicated to the export of virulence factors. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is part of a developing group of pathogenic bacteria that share the uncommon property of possessing two secA genes (secA1 and secA2). In mycobacteria, SecA1 is the essential 'housekeeping' SecA protein whereas SecA2 is an accessory secretion factor. Here we demonstrate that SecA2 contributes to the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis. A deletion of the secA2 gene in M. tuberculosis attenuates the virulence of the organism in mice. By comparing the profile of proteins secreted by wild-type M. tuberculosis and the  \\(\\Delta\\) secA2 mutant, we identified superoxide dismutase A (SodA) as a protein dependent on SecA2 for secretion. SodA lacks a classical signal sequence for protein export. Our data suggests that SecA2-dependent export is a new type of secretion pathway that is part of a virulence mechanism of M. tuberculosis to elude the oxidative attack of macrophages.\n\nAccepted 16 December, 2002. *For co\n</observation>"

Furthermore, we show that SecA2 is required for the optimal secretion of superoxide dismutase (SodA) and catalase-peroxidase (KatG). Both of these proteins are synthesized without Sec signal sequences and function to detoxify reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI). This work suggests that SecA2 is part of a specialized secretion system that contributes to the virulence of M. tuberculosis by countering the oxidative attack of the host.\n\n## Results\n\n### Deletion of secA2 in M. tuberculosis\n\nThe genome of M. tuberculosis possesses two open reading frames (secA1 and secA2) that encode homologues of the SecA protein (Cole et a\n\n================================================================================\n\n--- Mention 2 ---\ns/EPW21O7ubz7C0klqs8zOsLFypKqTgHbxn0r22iigAooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKACiiigAooooAKKKKACiiigD//2Q==)\n\nthe  \\(\\Delta\\) secA2 mutant. Thus, when SecA2 is absent SodA release into the culture filtrate is reduced while SodA accumulates with the cell. These results, in combination with our prior demonstration that SecA2 functions in protein export (13), strongly argue that SodA is secreted by an unconventional protein export pathway involving SecA2.\n\n### KatG release is dependent on SecA2\n\nSuperoxide dismutase (SodA) converts damaging superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide and oxygen. Thus, SecA2 may enable Mycobacterium tuberculosis to survive the oxidative attack of macrophages. This led us to directly test whether the release of KatG (catalase-peroxidase) is dependent on SecA2.

We showed previously in  \\(M.\\)  smegmatis that SecA1 is an essential 'housekeeping' SecA while SecA2 is a non-essential accessory secretion factor which functions in protein export (Braunstein et al., 2001). The 'extra' SecA in these bacteria may be part of a new type of specialized secretion pathway that functions in bacterial pathogenesis. This idea is supported by the recent demonstrations that the accessory SecA in  \\(L.\\)  monocytogenes, SecA2, contributes to virulence and the accessory sec locus (secA2 and secY2) in  \\(S.\\)  gordonii exports an adhesin for platelet binding (Bensing and Sullam, 2002; Lenz and Portnoy, 2002).\n\nIn this report we demonstrate that SecA2 functions in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis. Furthermore, we show that SecA2 is required for the optimal secretion of superoxide dismutase (SodA) and catalase-peroxidase (KatG). Both of these proteins are synthesized without Sec signal sequences and function to detoxify reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI). This work suggests that SecA2 is part of a specialized secretion system that contributes to the virulence of M. tuberculosis by countering the oxidative attack of the host.\n\n## Results\n\n### Deletion of secA2 in M. tuberculosis\n\nThe genome of M. tuberculosis possesses two open reading frames (secA1 and secA2) that encode homologues of the SecA protein (Cole et al., 1998; Braunstein et al., 2001).

In order to assess the role that SecA2 plays in pathogenesis, we constructed an in frame and unmarked deletion of secA2 in the virulent H37Rv strain of M. tuberculosis.

A thorough understanding of Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenesis will facilitate the development of new treatments for tuberculosis. Numerous bacterial pathogens possess specialized protein secretion systems that are dedicated to the export of virulence factors. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is part of a developing group of pathogenic bacteria that share the uncommon property of possessing two secA genes (secA1 and secA2). In mycobacteria, SecA1 is the essential 'housekeeping' SecA protein whereas SecA2 is an accessory secretion factor. Here we demonstrate that SecA2 contributes to the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis. A deletion of the secA2 gene in M. tuberculosis attenuates the virulence of the organism in mice.

Thus, SecA2 may enable Mycobacterium tuberculosis to survive the oxidative attack of macrophages. This led us to directly test whether the release of KatG (catalase-peroxidase) is dependent on SecA2. Catalase-peroxidase converts the damaging hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. Like SodA, a fraction of KatG has been identified in culture filtrates of M. tuberculosis and the protein lacks a classical\n\nTable 2.

Paper explicitly states: \"SecA2 is required for the optimal secretion of... catalase-peroxidase (KatG)\"\n2. Section \"KatG release is dependent on SecA2\" confirms the mechanism\n3. katG lacks a classical signal sequence but is still secreted\n4. The table shows reduced KatG in culture filtrates (CFPs) when SecA2 is deleted\n\nPATHWAY TYPE: SecA2\n\nREASONING:\n- The paper is specifically about SecA2-dependent secretion\n- katG is explicitly mentioned as one of the proteins dependent on SecA2 for secretion\n- SecA2 is one of the eight defined pathway types\n- The evidence directly links katG to the SecA2 secretion pathway\n\nCLASSIFICATION CONFIDENCE: HIGH\n\"\"\"\n\nos.makedirs(os.path.dirname(tmp_file), exist_ok=True)\nwith open(tmp_file, 'w') as f:\n    f.write(analysis_content)\n\nprint(f\"\\nDetailed analysis saved to: {tmp_file}\")\n</execute>"
