Classify gene entries in `benchmark/dataset/TF-Marker/tf_marker_entries.json` into five categories based on their functional description. 

Read the paper conent file `benchmark/dataset/TF-Marker/paper_content.md`. 

Classify the gene based on the paper content and following rules: (i) TF: TFs, which regulate the expression of markers. For example, FOXA1 (HNF3A) is a TF involved in embryonic development which plays an important role in cancer. Studies showed that FOXA1 could regulate the expression of cell marker PLOD2 by binding to its promoters, thereby affecting the occurrence and development of lung cancer; (ii) T Marker: markers, which are regulated by TFs. For example, TF POU5F1 controls the expression of marker genes (e.g. YES1, FGF4, UTF1 and ZFP206) involved in embryonic development. These genes are defined as Tmarker; (iii) I Marker: markers, which influence the activity of TFs. For example, Marker gene CD27 could activate PRDM1 and XBP1 by binding to TF CD70 on B cells. CD27 plays a role as I Marker; (iv) TFMarker: TFs, which play roles as markers. TFMarkers are usually cell/tissue-specific TFs and used as cell markers. For example, TF GATA3 is a definitive cell marker of breast cancer; and (v) TF Pmarker: TFs, which play roles as potential markers. For example, Becker et al. (12) found that TF LGR5 was a potential marker of intestinal stem cells in human .  

Save the resulting categories list to `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/claude-haiku-4-5/tf_marker_annotate.json`.

Output format (for reference):
[category_1, category_2, ...] 

All intermediate results should be save in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/claude-haiku-4-5/tf_marker_annotate` directory.

I'll help you classify gene entries in the TF-Marker dataset into the five categories based on their functional descriptions and the paper content. Let me start by creating a plan.

## Plan:
1. [ ] Load and examine the tf_marker_entries.json file
2. [ ] Read the paper_content.md file to understand the context
3. [ ] Analyze the structure of the gene entries
4. [ ] Implement classification logic based on the five categories
5. [ ] Classify each gene entry
6. [ ] Save results to the specified output directory

## ABSTRACT

Congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAMs) are rare lung abnormalities that result in cyst formation and are associated with respiratory distress in infants and malignant potential in adults. The pathogenesis of CPAMs remains unknown but data suggest disruption of the normal proximo-distal programme of airway branching and differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that adult human CPAM are lined with epithelium that retains SOX-2 and thyroid transcription factor-1 immunohistochemical markers, characteristic of the developing lung. However, RALDH-1, another key marker, is absent. This suggests a more complex aetiology for CPAM than complete focal arrest of lung development and may provide insight to the associated risk of malignancy.

## INTRODUCTION

The three-dimensional network of conducting airways is formed during the pseudoglandular phase of lung development, by branching morphogenesis. This process is controlled by temporal and spatial localisation of key genes and signalling molecules that co-ordinate to drive organ formation. The fundamental pathways used during development also have key roles in tissue haemeostasis and repair once the adult lung is formed; dysregulation of these same developmental pathways contributes to the pathogenesis of many adult diseases including emphysema, \(^{1}\)  fibrosis \(^{3}\)  and lung cancer. \(^{4}\)

Congenital pulmonary airway malformations (CPAMs) comprise a spectrum of lung abnormalities estimated to affect between: 1:11 000 and 1:35 000 live births. CPAMs are associated with neonatal respiratory distress, recurrent childhood pulmonary infection and, without resection, malignant potential in adults. CPAMs have traditionally been classified into types 0-4 depending on size and location of lesions present. The most common sub-types are 1  \((60\% -70\%)\) , characterised by large  \((>2\mathrm{cm})\)  intercommunicating cysts, and 2  \((15\% -20\%)\) , consisting of small  \((<2\mathrm{cm})\)  cysts and solid tissue

The high mobility group box transcription factor SOX-2, early embryogenic transcription factor thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and the retinoic acid synthesising enzyme RALDH-1 are necessary for normal patterning and development of airway branching in the mouse lung. In addition, SOX-2 overexpression in mouse has been previously found to result in cystic lesions resembling those observed in human CPAM. It is therefore hypothesised that alterations

in signalling during branching morphogenesis underlie CPAM pathogenesis. In these experimental pathology studies, we examine localisation of the proteins TTF-1, SOX-2 and RALDH-1 in lung tissue from 14 cases of type 1 and 2 cases of type 2 adult CPAM compared to normal adult lung parenchyma and embryonic (fetal) human lung.

## METHODS

Fourteen type 1 and 2 two type 2 CPAM resection specimens were obtained from the diagnostic archive of the Royal Brompton Hospital (ethics reference number 10/H0504/9). Normal adult lung tissue was obtained from the International Institute for the Advancement of Medicine (USA). Human fetal lung sections (14 weeks post conception, WPC) were provided by the Joint MRC/Wellcome Trust (099175/Z/12/Z) Human Developmental Biology Resource (www.hdbr.org). Sections of adult normal resected, CPAM and fetal human lung tissue underwent immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for SOX-2, TTF-1 and RALDH-1. Sections were incubated with primary antibody at optimised concentrations (Dako TTF clone 8G7G3/1 (M3575) at 1:500, Immune Systems. SOX-2 (GT15098) at 1:500 and Sigma ALDH1A1 (HPA002123) at 1:250) overnight at  \(4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) . Sections were then incubated with biotinylated antibody (1:50) from the VectaStain ABC kit followed by ABC reagent (1:50) and DAB substrate application. Sections were mounted in DPX and digital images were captured at  \(20\times\)  magnification using Leica Application Suite software (Leica microsystems, Milton Keynes, UK) for qualitative comparison of lung tissue sections.

## RESULTS

### SOX-2

Control embryonic lung section with primary antibody omitted shows no positive staining (figure 1A). In comparison, embryonic lung tissue shows positive SOX-2 immunostaining localised to airway epithelial cells with strong staining present in the large, proximal airways (figure 1B). SOX-2 was absent in normal adult epithelium (figure 1C) whereas positive SOX-2 staining was observed in CPAM lung tissue sections, localised to cyst-lining epithelial cells (figure 1D).

### TTF-1

Control embryonic lung section with primary antibody omitted shows no positive staining (figure 2A). TTF-1 was localised to airway

epithelial cells in embryonic lung tissue (figure 2B), but in adult sections was present in a sub-set of alveolar cells (figure 2C). In CPAM lung tissue sections, all cyst lining epithelial cells stained positively for TTF-1 (figure 2D).

### RALDH-1

Control embryonic lung section with primary antibody omitted shows no positive staining (figure 3A). Positive staining was localised to the airway epithelium in embryonic lung tissue (figure 3B). RALDH1 staining was absent in normal adult lung tissue (3K). Similarly, RALDH1 staining was absent, or only very weakly positive in CPAM lung tissue sections (figure 3C).

## DISCUSSION

This study shows that the embryonic airway epithelial cell markers SOX-2 and TTF-1 are retained in the cyst-lining epithelial cells of CPAM human lung tissue. However, localisation of

another key development protein, RALDH1, reported here for the first time, is similar to that of adult lungs. This suggests that the phenotype of CPAM epithelial cells may be more complex than complete focal arrest in development.

SOX-2, TTF-1 and RALDH1 expression in normal adult and embryonic lung tissue sections, as represented by positive IHC staining, was consistent with previous studies. [10] [11] SOX-2 is critical to cell pluripotency and self-renewal, with principal embryonic expression in the proximal airway epithelium during bronchiole development. In pseudoglandular human lungs, SOX-2 levels are high in proximal stalk epithelium (differentiating bronchioles), with low levels of SOX-2 present in the distal tip epithelium. Tip expression of SOX-2 disappears completely by 20 WPC and, as a result, involvement in peripheral alveolar development is minimal, and SOX-2 protein is absent in the adult lung. [12] However, expression was present in the cyst-lining epithelial cells of adult CPAM sections, suggesting cystic regions retain a proximal embryonic phenotype. This is supportive of previous studies by Ochieng et al demonstrating the likely role of SOX-2 overexpression in CPAM cyst development. [10]

TTF-1 expression in adult human lung tissue was localised to a sub-set of alveolar epithelial cells, presumably type II pneumocytes and absent from airway epithelium. TTF-1 is localised to all airway epithelial cells in human embryonic lungs but unlike SOX-2, there is no difference between proximal and distal airways. TTF-1 staining in cyst-lining epithelium of CPAM lung tissue more closely resembled the generalised epithelial expression of embryonic lung tiss</observation>

# TF-Marker Gene Classification Report

## Summary
Successfully classified 2 gene entries from the TF-Marker dataset based on the paper content and classification rules.

## Gene Classifications

### 1. SOX-2 → Category: TF (Transcription Factor)

**Rationale:**
- SOX-2 is described as "high mobility group box transcription factor SOX-2"
- It is a transcription factor that regulates gene expression
- Role: "critical to cell pluripotency and self-renewal"
- Principal embryonic expression in the proximal airway epithelium during bronchiole development
- SOX-2 overexpression in mouse results in cystic lesions resembling CPAM
- Acts as a regulator of developmental genes and cell fate decisions
- Classification matches Rule (i): TF - transcription factors which regulate the expression of markers

**Paper Evidence:**
"The high mobility group box transcription factor SOX-2, early embryogenic transcription factor thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) and the retinoic acid synthesising enzyme RALDH-1 are necessary for normal patterning and development of airway branching in the mouse lung."

"SOX-2 is critical to cell pluripotency and self-renewal, with principal embryonic expression in the proximal airway epithelium during bronchiole development."

---

### 2. TTF-1 (Thyroid Transcription Factor-1) → Category: TFMarker (TF Marker)

**Rationale:**
- TTF-1 is described as "early embryogenic transcription factor"
- It is a transcription factor (regulatory function)
- Serves as a cell/tissue-specific marker for lung tissue
- Expression pattern is tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific
- Used as an immunohistochemical marker to identify lung epithelial cells
- Acts as both a functional transcription factor AND a definitive cell marker
- Classification matches Rule (iv): TFMarker - TFs which play roles as markers. TFMarkers are usually cell/tissue-specific TFs and used as cell markers.

**Paper Evidence:**
"TTF-1 was localised to airway epithelial cells in embryonic lung tissue (figure 2B), but in adult sections was present in a sub-set of alveolar cells (figure 2C). In CPAM lung tissue sections, all cyst lining epithelial cells stained positively for TTF-1 (figure 2D)."

"TTF-1 is localised to all airway epithelial cells in human embryonic lungs but unlike SOX-2, there is no difference between proximal and distal airways."

---

## Classification Rules Applied

The classification follows the five categories defined in the task:

1. **TF** - Transcription factors which regulate the expression of markers
2. **T Marker** - Markers which are regulated by TFs
3. **I Marker** - Markers which influence the activity of TFs
4. **TFMarker** - TFs which play roles as markers (cell/tissue-specific TFs used as cell markers)
5. **TF Pmarker** - TFs which play roles as potential markers

Excellent! The task has been completed successfully. Let me provide a final summary:

## Task Completion Summary

I have successfully classified the gene entries from the TF-Marker dataset into five categories based on their functional descriptions and the paper content.

### Classification Results:

| Gene | Category | Justification |
|------|----------|---------------|
| **SOX-2** | **TF** | A transcription factor critical to cell pluripotency and self-renewal. It regulates embryonic lung development and airway branching morphogenesis. |
| **TTF-1** | **TFMarker** | A transcription factor that serves as a cell/tissue-specific marker for lung tissue. It's used as an immunohistochemical marker and is tissue-specific, making it both functional and a definitive cell marker. |

### Output Format:
```json
["TF", "TFMarker"]
```

### Files Generated:

1. **Temporary directory**: `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/claude-haiku-4-5/tf_marker_annotate/tf_marker_annotate.json`
2. **Final results**: `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/claude-haiku-4-5/tf_marker_annotate.json`
3. **Classification report**: `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/claude-haiku-4-5/tf_marker_annotate/classification_report.txt`
