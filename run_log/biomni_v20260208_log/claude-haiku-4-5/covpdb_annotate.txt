ABSTRACT: Golgi mannosidase II (GMII) catalyzes the sequential hydrolysis of two mannosyl residues from  \(\mathrm{GlcNAc}\) \(\mathrm{Man}_5\mathrm{GlcNAc}_2\)  to produce  \(\mathrm{GlcNAcMan}_3\mathrm{GlcNAc}_2,\)  the precursor for all complex  \(N\cdot\)  glycans, including the branched  \(N\cdot\)  glycans associated with cancer. Inhibitors of GMII are potential cancer therapeutics, but their usefulness is limited by off- target effects, which produce  \(\alpha\)  - mannosidosis- like symptoms. Despite many structural and mechanistic studies of GMII, we still lack a potent and selective inhibitor of this enzyme. Here, we synthesized manno- epicyclophellitol epoxide and aziridines and demonstrate their covalent modification and time- dependent inhibition of GMII. Application of fluorescent manno- epi- cyclophellitol aziridine derivatives enabled activity- based protein profiling of  \(\alpha\)  - mannosidases from both human cell lysate and mouse tissue extracts. Synthesized probes also facilitated a fluorescence polarization- based screen for dGMII inhibitors. We identified seven previously unknown inhibitors of GMII from a library of over 350 iminosugars and investigated their binding modalities through X- ray crystallography. Our results reveal previously unobserved inhibitor binding modes and promising scaffolds for the generation of selective GMII inhibitors.

## Thinking Process

Good! The file exists and contains a research paper about mannosidases and their inhibitors. I can see from the abstract that it mentions:
- "covalent modification" of GMII
- "manno-epi-cyclophellitol epoxide" and "aziridines" as inhibitors

This suggests the mechanisms involve:
1. Epoxide Opening (from the epoxide mentioned)
2. Aziridine Opening (from the aziridines mentioned)

## INTRODUCTION

Golgi  \(\alpha\)  - mannosidase (GMII, MAN2A1, mannosyl- oligosaccharide  \(1,3 / 1,6 - \alpha\)  - mannosidase) is a glycoside hydrolase from CAZy family  \(\mathrm{GH38^1}\)  that catalyzes sequential hydrolysis of both the terminal  \(\alpha - 1,3\cdot\)  and 1,6- linked mannoses from the  \(N\cdot\)  glycan  \(\mathrm{GlcNAcMan}_5\mathrm{GlcNAc}_2\)  Figure 1A), which is a committed step in the formation of complex  \(N\cdot\)  glycans.2 Altered  \(N\cdot\)  glycan branching has been directly linked to the metastatic potential of cells,4 and consequently, inhibitors of GMII are a potential target for anticancer therapeutics. The potent GMII mannosidase inhibitor swainsonine (Figure 1B), first identified in locoweed, has been investigated in this capacity. Swainsonine treatment reduces metastasis and improves outcome in breast, colon, and skin cancers.6- 8 However, swainsonine also produces side effects resembling the lysosomal storage disease  \(\alpha\)  - mannosidosis,10 resulting from the off- target inhibition of lysosomal  \(\alpha\)  - mannosidase MAN2B1 (LAM).

As GMII is an important anticancer target, many studies have sought to identify or design new and selective inhibitors. One avenue that has been explored is the modification of existing GMII inhibitors such as swainsonine and mannostatin A (Figure 1B). Swainsonine derivatives containing C5- substituents have been investigated, and although these compounds maintain inhibitory potency against Drosophila GMII (dGMII; 40% identity to human GMII), selectivity over Drosophila lysosomal mannosidase (dLAM; 45% identity to human LAM) is modest.11 Mannostatin A, a natural product  \(\alpha\) - mannosidase inhibitor produced by Streptoverticillium verticillus12 (Figure 1B), has also been derivatized in a similar fashion;13 however the analogues had a reduced specificity for human GMII over human LAM. Another class of inhibitor, the hydroxylated pyrrolidines, has also been investigated in the context of GMII inhibition. This class of mannosidase inhibitor was first identified by Popowycz et al.,14 and functionalized

![](images/e2625c76f0dd6e56f7981583f83b997011fab8612160896022911ff4f3f006b2.jpg)

hydroxylated pyrrolidines have subsequently been determined to be more selective toward GMII.  \({ }^{15- 18}\)  A different approach to identify inhibitors was employed by Kuntz and coworkers.  \({ }^{19}\)  Using a fluorogenic reporter substrate the authors screened a focused library of potential glycosidase inhibitors for action against dGMII. This study revealed several compounds including glucoimidazole and mannoimidazole, both with low micromolar inhibition constants for dGMII.

In the pursuit of new inhibitors of GMII we have applied the considerable power of cyclophellitol- like activity- based probes (ABPs).  \({ }^{20}\)  Herein we report the covalent inhibition of GMII with manno- epi- cyclophellitol epoxide and aziridine. A fluorescent derivative of the manno- epi- cyclophellitol aziridine enabled activity- based protein profiling (ABPP) of GH38  \(\alpha\) - mannosidases in both cells overexpressing human GH38s and mouse tissue extracts. This labeling could be reduced with known inhibitors of GH38s. We next developed a high- throughput fluorescence polarization ABPP screen for  \(\alpha\) - mannosidase inhibitors. Screening of our in- house focused library of over 350 iminosugars revealed seven previously unidentified GMII inhibitors, some of which were found by X- ray crystallography to bind in modes distinct from previously observed inhibitors. Together this gives us fresh insight into the design of GMII inhibitors and lead compounds for the creation of second- generation GMII inhibitors while also providing a high- throughput screening protocol for future library assessment.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Manno- epi- cyclophellitols Are Time- Dependent Inhibitors of dGMII. GMII is a GH38 retaining  \(\alpha\) - D- mannosidase that employs a two- step, double- displacement mechanism in which a covalent- enzyme intermediate is flanked by oxocarbenium- ion- like transition states.  \({ }^{21}\)  We reasoned that as the GH38 mechanism processes through a covalent intermediate, GMII would be an ideal target for the cyclophellitol class of GH inhibitors, which have become a powerful scaffold for the creation of activity- based glycosidase probes.  \({ }^{20}\)  The cyclophellitol class of GH inhibitors covalently modify retaining GHs, and activity- based probes bearing cyclophellitol warheads have enabled high- throughput inhibitor and drug discovery,  \({ }^{22}\)  biomass enzyme profiling,  \({ }^{23}\)  and detailed conformational and structural insight.  \({ }^{24,25}\)

Both the manno- epi- cyclophellitol epoxide (1) and aziridine (2) were synthesized (see Figure 2 and the Supporting

![](images/5b3ac3402682a27d9be2b1d5754f19c6e9b401eb1fb2e9afc483e86cab773fd1.jpg)  
Figure 2. Manno-epi-cyclophellitol inhibitors and probes used in this work.

Information for synthetic details) to ascertain whether these inhibitors could target dGMII. When 1 and 2 were incubated with recombinant dGMII, we observed that both displayed time- dependent inhibition, which is typical for cyclophellitol- type inhibitors (see Figure S1). To compare the reactivity of these two compounds, second- order rate constants  \(\left(k_{\text{inact}} / K_{\text{I}}\right)\)  were determined using 4- methylumbelliferyl  \(\alpha\) - D- mannopyranoside (MU-  \(\alpha\) - Man) as a substrate. The  \(k_{\text{inact}} / K_{\text{I}}\)  value for 1 was determined to be  \(50 \pm 5 \mathrm{min}^{- 1} \mathrm{M}^{- 1}\) , while the observed inhibition constant for aziridine 2 was over 100- fold higher  \(\left(5500 \pm 100 \mathrm{min}^{- 1} \mathrm{M}^{- 1}\right)\) . This enhanced inhibition of 2 is consistent with the trend previously observed for  \(\alpha\) - glucosidases by epi- cyclophellitol epoxides and aziridines.  \({ }^{26}\)

We next obtained a crystal structure of dGMII that had been soaked with aziridine 2. The reacted manno- epi- cyclophellitol moiety is covalently linked to the nucleophile Asp204 in the X- ray structure (Figure 3B). This structure clearly shows the opening of the aziridine ring resulting from nucleophilic attack at the pseudoanomeric carbon (Figure 3A). The resulting enzyme- bound cyclitol structure displays a  \({ }^{1} \mathrm{~S}_{5}\)  skew boat conformation, which is consistent with the proposed  \({ }^{0} \mathrm{~S}_{2} / \mathrm{B}_{2,5} \rightarrow \mathrm{B}_{2,5}{}_{2}^{+} \rightarrow {}^{1} \mathrm{~S}_{5}\)  reaction itinerary for GH38  \(\alpha\) - mannosidases.  \({ }^{21,27}\)  Comparison to the structure of 2- deoxy- 2- fluoro- D- mannose bound to the dGMII D341N acid/base mutant  \({ }^{21}\)

2. **Epoxide Opening** - The paper mentions "manno-epi-cyclophellitol epoxide" as an inhibitor

2. The paper mentions "epoxide" - this is **Epoxide Opening**

Excellent! I found the mechanisms. Now I need to:

From the paper, the main covalent bonding mechanisms are:
- **Aziridine Opening** - explicitly mentioned and described with mechanism details
- **Epoxide Opening** - explicitly mentioned as an inhibitor

The "Nucleophilic Addition" is part of the mechanism but the primary mechanisms are Aziridine Opening and Epoxide Opening. Let me check which one is the primary focus and save the results.

Since both mechanisms are present and the paper focuses on both, I should include both.

To compare the reactivity of these two compounds, second- order rate constants  \(\left(k_{\text{inact}} / K_{\text{I}}\right)\)  were determined using 4- methylumbelliferyl  \(\alpha\) - D- mannopyranoside (MU-  \(\alpha\) - Man) as a substrate. The  \(k_{\text{inact}} / K_{\text{I}}\)  value for 1 was determined to be  \(50 \pm 5 \mathrm{min}^{- 1} \mathrm{M}^{- 1}\) , while the observed inhibition constant for aziridine 2 was over 100- fold higher  \(\left(5500 \pm 100 \mathrm{min}^{- 1} \mathrm{M}^{- 1}\right)\) .

## Thinking Process

Perfect! Now I have clear evidence:

1. The paper synthesized both epoxide (1) and aziridine (2)
2. Both are used as inhibitors and show covalent modification
3. The mechanism section explicitly describes "opening of the aziridine ring resulting from nucleophilic attack"
4. The paper shows both mechanisms are relevant

The primary mechanisms identified are:
- **Aziridine Opening** - explicitly described with mechanism details
- **Epoxide Opening** - also synthesized and used as inhibitor

Since the paper focuses on both and both are covalent mechanisms, I should list both. However, looking at the task requirement which asks for "the mechanisms" (potentially singular or multiple), let me check if I need to identify a single primary one or list all. Based on the paper content, both are equally important. Let me now create the output directories and save the results.

print(f"✓ Created output directory: {output_dir}")
print(f"✓ Created tmp directory: {tmp_dir}")

# The primary mechanism based on the paper is Aziridine Opening
# (as it's the one with detailed mechanism description and higher inhibition constant)
primary_mechanism = "Aziridine Opening"

# However, both mechanisms are present in the paper
# Let me determine which one to report based on the emphasis
# The aziridine shows 100-fold higher reactivity, so it's the primary focus

print(f"\n✓ Primary mechanism identified: {primary_mechanism}")

# Save the result to the output file
output_file = os.path.join(output_dir, "covpdb_annotate.txt")

## Thinking Process

Great! I've successfully identified and saved the primary covalent bonding mechanism. However, let me verify my analysis is complete by:

1. Double-checking if both mechanisms should be reported or just the primary one
2. Creating intermediate analysis files in the tmp directory for documentation
3. Confirming the final output format matches the requirement

Looking at the paper again:
- Both epoxide and aziridine are synthesized
- The aziridine shows 100-fold higher reactivity (k_inact/K_I of 5500 vs 50)
- The detailed mechanism section focuses on aziridine opening
- Therefore, **Aziridine Opening** is the primary mechanism

Let me also create intermediate documentation files.

## Summary

I have successfully completed the task of determining the covalent bonding mechanism from the PDF content file. Here's what was accomplished:

### Analysis Results:

**Paper Analyzed:** "Manno-epi-cyclophellitols Enable Activity-Based Protein Profiling of Human α-Mannosidases and Discovery of New Golgi Mannosidase II Inhibitors"

**Mechanisms Identified:**
1. **Aziridine Opening** (PRIMARY) - The paper describes the opening of the aziridine ring resulting from nucleophilic attack at the pseudoanomeric carbon, with a kinetic constant of 5500 ± 100 min⁻¹ M⁻¹
2. **Epoxide Opening** (SECONDARY) - The paper also synthesized manno-epi-cyclophellitol epoxide as an inhibitor with a kinetic constant of 50 ± 5 min⁻¹ M⁻¹

### Primary Mechanism Determination:

**Aziridine Opening** was selected as the primary mechanism because:
- It shows 100-fold higher reactivity compared to the epoxide
- The detailed mechanistic characterization is presented in the results section
- The crystal structure clearly shows the aziridine ring opening mechanism

### Output Files:

- **Main Result:** `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/claude-haiku-4-5/covpdb_annotate.txt` containing "Aziridine Opening"
- **Intermediate Files:** 
  - `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/claude-haiku-4-5/covpdb_annotate/mechanism_analysis.json` - Detailed analysis
  - `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/claude-haiku-4-5/covpdb_annotate/extraction_log.txt` - Extraction log
