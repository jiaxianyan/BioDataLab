Reviewing the three drug-drug interactions description in the file `benchmark/dataset/DDInter/DDI.txt` and classified them into different risk levels (Major, Moderate, Minor, and Unknown). 

Generally, Major interactions were highly clinically significant and the drug combinations should be strictly avoided; Moderate interactions may result in exacerbation of the disease of the patient and/or change in therapy; Minor interactions were minimally clinically significant and usually they do not require changes in therapy; Unknown interactions meant that the interaction description was unavailable or incomplete.

Finially, saving the classification list into file /root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_pred_results/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.2/ddinter_annotate_1.json.

Output format  (for reference):
[risk_level_1, risk_level_2, ...]

All intermediate results should be save in `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_tmp/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.2/ddinter_annotate_1` directory.

 Drug-Drug Interaction 1:
The concomitant use of fluphenazine and antithyroid agents may theoretically increase the risk of agranulocytosis. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown but may be related to synergistic effects as both drugs have been associated with agranulocytosis.
If these drugs must be used together, close observation and testing for evidence of granulocytopenia is recommended. Patients should be advised to promptly report any symptoms such as tiredness, weakness, sore throat

--- DDI 2 (first 300 chars) ---
Coadministration of efavirenz with other agents known to induce hepatotoxicity may potentiate the risk of liver injury. Efavirenz has been associated with hepatotoxicity during postmarketing use.
The risk of hepatic injury should be considered when efavirenz is used in combination with other agents 

--- DDI 3 (first 300 chars) ---
Coadministration with inhibitors of CYP450 2C19 may increase the plasma concentrations of brivaracetam, which is partially metabolized by the isoenzyme. The risk of a clinically relevant CYP450 2C19-mediated interaction is considered to be low according to the manufacturer.
