There are 5 summary infromation about NCBI GEO datasets in the file `benchmark/dataset/MVIP/gds_test_data.txt`. 

Based on these information, fetching out the high throughput sequencing dataset certainly related to virus infection. 

Saving the keeped dataset idx list [index_1, index_2, ...] in /root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_pred_results/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.2/mvip_annotate.tsv. 

Output format example:

1. Effect of disruption of  STAT3 Y705 phosphorylation on lung gene expression in mice during influenza virus infection
(Submitter supplied) To investigate the functional relevance of the STAT3 Y705 in antiviral immunity, we established STAT3 705 tyrosine site mutation (STAT3Y705F/+) mice and infected them with influenza virus for 24 h, then collected the lungs. We then performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of 3 different samples.

My reasoning: all 5 summaries explicitly describe viruses/viral infection (influenza virus, Senecavirus A, HSV-1/IAV infections, systemic/respiratory viral infections) and are high-throughput sequencing (RNA-seq, Ribo-seq, etc.), so all 5 are certainly related to virus infection and should be kept.

Plan:
1. [✓] Load and parse the 5 GEO summaries from `benchmark/dataset/MVIP/gds_test_data.txt`
2. [✓] Identify which entries are high-throughput sequencing AND certainly virus-infection-related
3. [✓] Save the kept dataset index list to `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_pred_results/OpenAI/Azure-GPT-5.2/mvip_annotate.tsv` and store temp parsing outputs in the requested tmp folder
