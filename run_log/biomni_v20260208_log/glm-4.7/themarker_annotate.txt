Given txt file containing biomarkers and their functions in the file `benchmark/dataset/TheMarker/biomarker.txt`. 

According to the roles of these biomarkers played, labelled the biomarkers as pharmacodynamic biomarker (PDY), safety biomarker (SAF), monitoring biomarker (MOI), predictive biomarker (PRD) and surrogate endpoint (SUR). 

Saving the classification list [label_1, label_2, ...] in the same sort as input file to json file `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/glm-4.7/themarker_annotate.json`. 

The output format example is as follows:
["PDY", "SAF", "MOI", "PRD", "SUR"]

All intermediate results should be saved in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/glm-4.7/themarker_annotate` directory.

I'll help you classify biomarkers based on their functions. Let me start by creating a plan and then executing it step by step.

**Plan:**
1. [ ] Read the biomarker.txt file to understand its format and content
2. [ ] Create the necessary directories for output
3. [ ] Analyze each biomarker and its function to classify it into appropriate categories
4. [ ] Save the classification results to the JSON file
5. [ ] Save intermediate results to the tmp directory

Let me start by reading the biomarker file:

<execute>
# Read the biomarker.txt file
with open('benchmark/dataset/TheMarker/biomarker.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    content = f.read()
    print(content[:2000])  # Print first 2000 characters to see the format
    print("\n--- Total length ---")
    print(len(content))
</execute>
<observation>Biomarker ID	Biomarker Name	Gene Name	Synonyms	Biomarker Class	Function
B07XCZ	Laminin subunit alpha-3	LAMA3; LAMNA	Laminin subunit alpha 3; Epiligrin 170 kDa subunit; E170; Epiligrin subunit alpha; Kalinin subunit alpha; Laminin-5 subunit alpha; Laminin-6 subunit alpha; Laminin-7 subunit alpha; Nicein subunit alpha	Protein	Binding to cells via a high affinity receptor, laminin is thought to mediate the attachment, migration and organization of cells into tissues during embryonic development by interacting with other extracellular matrix components. Laminin-5 is thought to be involved in cell adhesion via integrin alpha-3/beta-1 in focal adhesion and integrin alpha-6/beta-4 in hemidesmosomes, signal transduction via tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125-FAK and p80, differentiation of keratinocytes.
B36BFV	IL2 mRNA	IL2	Interleukin-2 mRNA; IL-2 mRNA; T-cell growth factor mRNA; TCGF mRNA	mRNA	Cytokine produced by activated CD4-positive helper T-cells and to a lesser extend activated CD8-positive T-cells and natural killer cells that plays pivotal roles in the immune response and tolerance. Binds to a receptor complex composed of either the high-affinity trimeric IL-2R or the low-affinity dimeric IL-2R. Interaction with the receptor leads to oligomerization and conformation changes in the IL-2R subunits resulting in downstream signaling starting with phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3. In turn, JAK1 and JAK3 phosphorylate the receptor to form a docking site leading to the phosphorylation of several substrates including STAT5. This process leads to activation of several pathways including STAT, phosphoinositide-3-kinase/PI3K and mitogen-activated protein kinase/MAPK pathways. Functions as a T-cell growth factor and can increase NK-cell cytolytic activity as well. Promotes strong proliferation of activated B-cells and subsequently immunoglobulin production. Plays a pivotal role in regulating the adaptive immune system by controlling the survival and proliferation of regulatory
