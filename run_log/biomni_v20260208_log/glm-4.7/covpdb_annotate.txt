Given a pdf content file `benchmark/dataset/CovPDB/pdf_content.md`. 

Determining the covalent bonding mechanisms based on the given paper. 

The mechanisms must be one of: Aziridine Opening; Beta-Lactam Addition; Borylation; Composite Reaction; Cyclohemiaminoacetalization; Disulfide Formation; Epoxide Opening; Hemiaminalization; Hemi(thio)acetalization; Imidazolidinone Opening; Imine Condensation; Lactone Addition; Michael Addition; Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution; Nucleophilic Addition to a Double Bond; Nucleophilic Addition to a Triple Bond; Nucleophilic Aliphatic Subsititution; Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution; Phosphorylation; Ring Opening; Sulfonylation

Saving the mechanisms into `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/glm-4.7/covpdb_annotate.txt`.  

# Output Format (For Reference)
Sulfonylation

# Intermediate Results
All intermediate files generated should be saved in the directly `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/glm-4.7/covpdb_annotate`

I'll help you determine the covalent bonding mechanism from the PDF content file and save the result. Let me start by creating a plan and then executing it.

**Plan:**
1. [ ] Read the PDF content file to understand the paper's content
2. [ ] Analyze the content to identify the covalent bonding mechanism
3. [ ] Create necessary directories for intermediate files and results
4. [ ] Save the determined mechanism to the output file
5. [ ] Save intermediate results to the temporary directory

Let me start by reading the PDF content file.

Supporting Information

ABSTRACT: Golgi mannosidase II (GMII) catalyzes the sequential hydrolysis of two mannosyl residues from  \(\mathrm{GlcNAc}\) \(\mathrm{Man}_5\mathrm{GlcNAc}_2\)  to produce  \(\mathrm{GlcNAcMan}_3\mathrm{GlcNAc}_2,\)  the precursor for all complex  \(N\cdot\)  glycans, including the branched  \(N\cdot\)  glycans associated with cancer. Inhibitors of GMII are potential cancer therapeutics, but their usefulness is limited by off- target effects, which produce  \(\alpha\)  -

--- Section 3 (line 33) ---
hydroxylated pyrrolidines have subsequently been determined to be more selective toward GMII.  \({ }^{15- 18}\)  A different approach to identify inhibitors was employed by Kuntz and coworkers.  \({ }^{19}\)  Using a fluorogenic reporter substrate the authors screened a focused library of potential glycosidase inhibitors for action against dGMII. This study revealed several compounds including glucoimidazole and mannoimidazole, both with low micromolar inhibition constants for dGMII.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Manno- epi- cyclophellitols Are Time- Dependent Inhibitors of dGMII. GMII is a GH38 retaining  \(\alpha\) - D- mannosidase that employs a two- step, double- displacement mechanism in which a covalent- enzyme intermediate is flanked by oxocarbenium- ion- like transition states.  \({ }^{21}\)  We reasoned that as the GH38 mechanism processes through a covalent intermediate, GMII would be an ideal target for the cyclophellitol class of GH inhibitors, which have become a p

## CONCLUSIONS

Manno- epi- cyclophellitols have proven to be powerful tools for the study of GH38  \(\alpha\)  - mannosidases and the identification of new inhibitors. The epoxide and aziridine analogues and fluorescent derivatives are covalent time- dependent inhibitors. X- ray crystallography has revealed the  \({}^{1}S_{5}\)  conformation of these cyclophellitols, which is consistent with theoretical predictions for the glycosyl- enzyme intermediate. Fluorescent derivatives have enabled the

CONCLUSIONS

Manno- epi- cyclophellitols have proven to be powerful tools for the study of GH38  \(\alpha\)  - mannosidases and the identification of new inhibitors. The epoxide and aziridine analogues and fluorescent derivatives are covalent time- dependent inhibitors. X- ray crystallography has revealed the  \({}^{1}S_{5}\)  conformation of these cyclophellitols, which is consistent with theoretical predictions for the glycosyl- enzyme intermediate. Fluorescent derivatives have enabled the profiling of tissue- dependent GH38 activity and a previously unseen proteolyzed form of hEpman. Additionally, a FluoPol- ABPP screen with excellent characteristics and low substrate and enzyme requirements was developed using the fluorescently tagged manno- epi- cyclophellitol aziridine.
