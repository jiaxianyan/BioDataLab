Reviewing the three drug-drug interactions description in the file `benchmark/dataset/DDInter/DDI.txt` and classified them into different risk levels (Major, Moderate, Minor, and Unknown). 

Generally, Major interactions were highly clinically significant and the drug combinations should be strictly avoided; Moderate interactions may result in exacerbation of the disease of the patient and/or change in therapy; Minor interactions were minimally clinically significant and usually they do not require changes in therapy; Unknown interactions meant that the interaction description was unavailable or incomplete.

Finially, saving the classification list into file /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/glm-4.7/ddinter_annotate_1.json.

Output format  (for reference):
[risk_level_1, risk_level_2, ...]

All intermediate results should be save in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/glm-4.7/ddinter_annotate_1` directory.

I'll help you review and classify the drug-drug interactions from the DDI.txt file. Let me start by creating a plan.

## Plan:
1. [ ] Read the DDI.txt file to see the three drug-drug interaction descriptions
2. [ ] Analyze each interaction description
3. [ ] Classify each interaction into risk levels (Major, Moderate, Minor, Unknown) based on criteria
4. [ ] Create the output directory for intermediate results
5. [ ] Save intermediate results
6. [ ] Save the final classification list to the specified JSON file

Let me start by reading the DDI.txt file.

<execute>
# Step 1: Read the DDI.txt file
print("Step 1: Reading DDI.txt file...")

with open('benchmark/dataset/DDInter/DDI.txt', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()
    print("Content of DDI.txt:")
    print(content)
    print("\n" + "="*80 + "\n")
</execute>
<observation>Step 1: Reading DDI.txt file...
Content of DDI.txt:
Drug-Drug Interaction 1:
The concomitant use of fluphenazine and antithyroid agents may theoretically increase the risk of agranulocytosis. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown but may be related to synergistic effects as both drugs have been associated with agranulocytosis.
If these drugs must be used together, close observation and testing for evidence of granulocytopenia is recommended. Patients should be advised to promptly report any symptoms such as tiredness, weakness, sore throat, fever, stomatitis, malaise, or flu-like symptoms.

Drug-Drug Interaction 2:
Coadministration of efavirenz with other agents known to induce hepatotoxicity may potentiate the risk of liver injury. Efavirenz has been associated with hepatotoxicity during postmarketing use.
The risk of hepatic injury should be considered when efavirenz is used in combination with other agents that are potentially hepatotoxic (e.g., acetaminophen; alcohol; androgens and anabolic steroids; antituberculous agents; azole antifungal agents; ACE inhibitors; cyclosporine (high dosages); disulfiram; endothelin receptor antagonists; interferons; ketolide and macrolide antibiotics; kinase inhibitors; minocycline; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents; other HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors; proteasome inhibitors; retinoids; sulfonamides; tamoxifen; thiazolidinediones; tolvaptan; vincristine; zileuton; anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine, hydantoins, felbamate, and valproic acid; lipid-lowering medications such as fenofibrate, lomitapide, mipomersen, niacin, and statins; herbals and nutritional supplements such as black cohosh, chaparral, comfrey, DHEA, kava, pennyroyal oil, and red yeast rice). Patients should be advised to seek medical attention if they experience potential signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as fever, rash, itching, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, malaise, right upper quadrant pain, dark urine, pale stools, and jaundice. Monitoring of liver function tests should occur before and during treatment, especially in patients with underlying hepatic disease (including hepatitis B or C coinfection) or marked transaminase elevations.

Drug-Drug Interaction 3:
Coadministration with inhibitors of CYP450 2C19 may increase the plasma concentrations of brivaracetam, which is partially metabolized by the isoenzyme. The risk of a clinically relevant CYP450 2C19-mediated interaction is considered to be low according to the manufacturer.

## Summary

I reviewed the three drug-drug interactions from `benchmark/dataset/DDInter/DDI.txt` and classified them into risk levels:

**Classification Results:**
- **Drug-Drug Interaction 1** (fluphenazine + antithyroid agents): **Moderate** - Risk of agranulocytosis that requires close monitoring but can be managed with precautions
- **Drug-Drug Interaction 2** (efavirenz + hepatotoxic agents): **Moderate** - Risk of hepatotoxicity requiring liver function monitoring and potential therapy changes
- **Drug-Drug Interaction 3** (brivaracetam + CYP450 2C19 inhibitors): **Minor** - Manufacturer states the risk is low with minimal clinical significance

**Final Classification List:**
