We compiled a focused library consisting of  \\(>500\\)  commercially available or newly synthesized 8-hydroxyquinoline (8OHQ) derivatives whose toxicity is paradoxically increased rather than decreased by the activity of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a transporter conferring multidrug resistance (MDR). Here, we deciphered the mechanism of action of NSC297366 that shows exceptionally strong Pgp-potentiated toxicity. Treatment of cells with NSC297366 resulted in changes associated with the activity of potent anticancer iron chelators.\nLine 30: Strikingly, iron depletion was more pronounced in MDR cells due to the Pgp-mediated efflux of NSC297366-iron complexes. Our results indicate that iron homeostasis can be targeted by MDR-selective compounds for the selective elimination of multidrug resistant cancer cells, setting the stage for a therapeutic approach to fight transporter-mediated drug resistance.\nLine 34: efflux of the drugs to reduce their concentrations below a cell-killing threshold (1, 2). Upregulation of cell membrane efflux transporters of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily leads to simultaneous resistance against structurally and functionally unrelated chemotherapeutic agents. In particular, P-glycoprotein (Pgp, MDR1), the product of ABCB1 gene, was shown to be expressed in several drug resistant malignancies, including ovarian carcinoma (3), acute myeloid leukemia (4), chronic myeloid leukemia (5), small cell lung cancer (6), and more (1, 2).\nLine 36: On the basis of the correlation of P-glycoprotein expression and function (7) with unfavorable treatment response, it is universally accepted that pharmacologic modulation of the multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype has the potential to significantly increase the efficacy of currently available anticancer therapies. Unfortunately, despite a few early successes, clinical trials conducted with Pgp inhibitors did not fulfill this expectation, failing to confirm clinical benefit (8). Failure of the trials led to a setback in research, and the shutdown of the pharmaceutical development of transporter inhibitors for the improvement of anticancer therapy. Yet the \"transporter problem\" has not vanished, as evidenced by new studies supporting the relevance and benefit of research on the role of ABC transporters in clinical drug resistance (2). For example, studies conducted with genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) mirroring many aspects of the human disease have shown that acquired resistance to docetaxel, doxorubicin, topotecan or olaparib is caused by the increased expression of the Abcb1 or Abcg2 genes, and the contribution of drug efflux to drug resistance was also confirmed in ABC transporter-deficient tumors (9).\nLine 46: Here, we describe the relation of iron chelation to the MDR-selective toxicity of NSC297366, a compound containing an 8-hydroxyquinoline substructure possessing exceptionally strong Pgp-potentiated toxicity. We show that the toxicity of NSC297366 is linked to cellular iron depletion, which is exacerbated by Pgp.\nLine 52: MES-SA, MES-SA/DX5 cells were obtained from ATCC where they were characterized by DNA fingerprinting. The ABCB1-overexpressing subline MES-SA/B1 was produced by lentiviral transduction of pRRL-EF1-ABCB1. MES-SA mCherry and MES-SA/B1 mOrange cell lines were engineered to overexpress the fluorescent protein with lentiviral transduction of pRRL-EF1 plasmids. P-glycoprotein function was characterized by the Calcein AM assay (Supplementary Fig. S2; ref. 7). Cells were periodically tested and resulted negative for Mycoplasma contamination with the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza). Cells were cultured for not more than 30 passages or 3 months after thawing. Cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with  \\(10\\%\\)  fetal bovine serum (Gibco),  \\(5\\mathrm{mmol / L}\\)  L-glutamine (Gibco), and  \\(50~\\mathrm{U / mL}\\)  penicillin/streptomycin solution (Life Technologies).\nLine 56: Doxorubicin was purchased from TEVA. NSC297366 was obtained from DTP's drug repository (NCI, NIH). Tariquidar was a kind gift from Susan Bates (NCI, NIH, Bethesda, MD). Verapamil, iron chloride, deferiprone, cobalt chloride, human holotransferrin and deferasirox were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Iron chloride, cobalt chloride and transferrin were used in aqueous solutions, all other chemicals were dissolved in DMSO.\nLine 66: Cells grown in 6-well plates were homogenized in  \\(1\\mathrm{ml}\\)  TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at  \\(80\\%\\)  confluency. Total RNA was isolated from cell lysates using Direct-zol MiniPrep Kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. cDNA samples were prepared from  \\(1,000~\\mathrm{ng}\\)  total RNA using the AMV Reverse Transcription System Kit (Promega). TaqMan probes for ABCB1, RPLP0, TFRC, NDRG1 and VEGFA were ordered from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Real-time PCR analyses were carried out using the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific); mRNA fold changes were determined by the  \\(2^{-\\Delta \\Delta C_{t}}\\)  method. Gene expression levels were normalized to RPLP0 (60S acidic ribosomal protein P0) expression.\nLine 70: Cells were lysed with MLB (No. 20-168, Merck KGaA) cell lysis solution containing  \\(10~\\mu \\mathrm{g / mL}\\)  aprotinin and  \\(10~\\mu \\mathrm{g / mL}\\)  leupeptin. Following SDS-PAGE and blotting, HIF1 \\(\\alpha\\)  was detected using anti-HIF1 \\(\\alpha\\)  Rabbit polyclonal antibody (ab51608, Abcam UK) in 1:500 dilution. Cell cycle-related protein levels were revealed using the cell-cycle regulation sampler kits (#9932 & #9870, Cell Signaling Technology Inc.). Anti-p53 antibody (#2524, Cell Signaling Technology) was used in 1:500 dilution. Anti- \\(\\beta\\) -actin (clone AC-15, Sigma) was used to reveal endogenous control protein levels. Signals were detected using the HRP-conjugated goat antimouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Immunoblots were revealed by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Advanta Inc.).\nLine 84: ATPase activity of crude membranes isolated from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells expressing human P-glycoprotein was measured by colorimetric detection of inorganic phosphate liberation as described in (21). Preformed iron complexes of NSC297366 or 8-hydroxyquinoline were prepared by mixing the ligand with 0.5 equivalents of iron.\nLine 88: MES-SA and MES-SA/B1 cells were pretreated with  \\(25\\mu \\mathrm{mol} / \\mathrm{L}\\)  holotransferrin in serum-free medium for 4 hours  \\((37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})\\)  to fill intracellular iron pools. Following incubation with the chelators (see Fig. 6 legend for details), trypsinized cells were resuspended in DMEM supplemented with  \\(10\\%\\)  v/v FBS, and were washed three times in  \\(1\\mathrm{mL}\\)  of PBS. In the accumulation experiments, cells were treated for 4 hours with  \\(5\\mu \\mathrm{mol} / \\mathrm{L}\\)  of the iron-chelator complexes. Intracellular iron content was determined by total-reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) as described in ref. 22. Briefly, cell pellets were digested for 24 hours at room temperature in a solution containing  \\(20~\\mu \\mathrm{L}\\) \\(30\\%\\) \\(\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}_2\\) ,  \\(80~\\mu \\mathrm{L}\\) \\(65\\%\\) \\(\\mathrm{HNO}_3\\) , and  \\(10~\\mu \\mathrm{L}\\)  of  \\(15~\\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{mL}\\)  Ga (Merck; added as an internal standard). Two microliters of the resulting solutions was pipetted on the quartz reflectors of an Atomika 8030C TXRF spectrometer (Atomika Instruments GmbH). The K  \\(\\alpha\\)  line used for determination of Fe was set to  \\(6.403\\mathrm{keV}\\) .\nLine 100: ### Screening of a focused 8-hydroxyquinoline library identifies MDR-selective derivatives whose toxicity is potentiated by P-glycoprotein\nLine 104: pounds, we compiled a focused library consisting of  \\(>500\\)  commercially available or newly synthesized 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives and screened the compounds using the parental MES-SA and the multidrug resistant MES-SA/DX5 cell lines. This screening effort has confirmed the relevance of the 8-hydroxyquinoline backbone in MDR-selective toxicity, and the requirement of functional Pgp to mediate sensitization of MDR cells (Fig. 1A). NSC297366, in which the 8OHQ substructure is embedded into a ring is one of the highly active derivatives, and thus was chosen to characterize the mechanism of action of MDR-selective toxicity (results obtained with 4 additional MDR-selective 8OHQ derivatives are shown in Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). To explore the specific contribution and the functional relevance of P-glycoprotein in collateral sensitivity to NSC297366, we generated MES-SA/B1 cells by lentiviral transduction of MES-SA cells with an expression vector encoding human MDR1 cDNA. Using this isogenic cell line pair, we confirmed that the moderate expression of P-glycoprotein in MES-SA/B1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A-S2C) is sufficient to confer resistance to doxorubicin as well as increased sensitivity to NSC297366 (Fig. 1B). Both phenotypes were fully reversed by the specific Pgp inhibitor tariquidar, showing the reliance of collateral sensitivity on P-glycoprotein function. Notably, MDR-selective to</observation>"

MES-SA mCherry and MES-SA/B1 mOrange cell lines were engineered to overexpress the fluorescent protein with lentiviral transduction of pRRL-EF1 plasmids. P-glycoprotein function was characterized by the Calcein AM assay (Supplementary Fig. S2; ref. 7).

To test the role of iron in the toxicity of NSC297366, we repeated the cytotoxicity experiments in the presence of established iron chelators or excess iron  \\(\\mathrm{(FeCl_3)}\\) . Excess iron attenuated the toxicity of NSC297366. Strikingly, the protective effect of excess iron was more pronounced in MES-SA/B1 cells (Fig. 2A), leading to a significant reduction of selective toxicity in the presence of higher  \\(\\mathrm{FeCl}_3\\)  concentrations (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Table S1). Conversely, MES-SA/B1 cells proved to be more sensitive to the combined effect of NSC297366 and the establishe\n...\n\n=== Section 14 (Results/Discussion/Conclusion) ===\n P-glycoprotein increases the NSC297366-mediated induction of TfR mRNA levels and the stabilization of HIF1 \\(\\alpha\\)\n\nIn iron-starved cells, upregulation of TfR1 levels ensure increased acquisition of iron through the receptor-mediated endocytosis of the transferrin-iron complex. In the next set of experiments, we evaluated the effect of NSC297366 on transferrin receptor (TfR1) mRNA levels in MES-SA and MES-SA/B1 cells. Despite similar steady state TfR1 levels, induction of TfR1 mRNA expression by  \\(1\\mu \\mathrm{mol} / \\mathrm{L}\\)  NSC297366 was exclusively observed in MES-SA/B1 cells (Fig. 3A).

Whereas excess iron downregulated TfR1 levels in both \n...\n\n=== Section 15 (Results/Discussion/Conclusion) ===\n Chelation is not sufficient to convey MDR-selective toxicity\n\nThe results presented so far indicate that collateral sensitivity of MDR cells may be due to the increased susceptibility of P-glycoprotein expressing cells to NSC297366-induced iron depletion. Since similar baseline  \\(TfR\\)  or HIF1 \\(\\alpha\\)  levels in MES-SA and MES-SA/B1 cells did not suggest a direct effect of Pgp on iron homeostasis, we compared the susceptibility of the two cell lines to a series of established iron chelators.

A commonly\n\ndescribed target of anticancer chelators, RNR catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleoside diphosphates (NDP) to deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates (dNDP) that are subsequently converted into deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTP; ref. 27). Treatment with the established RNR inhibitor hydroxyurea lead to an imbalance of the dNTP pools, resulting in the significant decrease of dATP levels in both cell lines (28). In contrast, treatment with NSC29736\n...\n\n=== Section 17 (Results/Discussion/Conclusion) ===\n P-glycoprotein depletes cellular iron below critical levels by effluxing the NSC297366-iron complex from the cells\n\nFinally, to directly test if selective toxicity of NSC297366 is indeed linked to excess iron depletion, intracellular iron levels were followed by TXRF (22). Resting iron levels were not different, and loading with transferrin-bound iron resulted in a comparable increase of iron levels in both cell lines (Fig. 6A). Following incubation at  \\(37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\) , cellular iron levels showed a gradual decrease indicative of the activation of regulatory mechanisms restoring iron levels after loading with holotransferrin (29). The presence of 8OHQ did not influence this pattern, and treatment with NSC297366 also did not change the kinetics of iron release in MES-SA cells dur\n...\n\n--- Searching for P-glycoprotein/ABCB1 mentions with context ---\n\nMatch 1: P-Glycoprotein-Expressing Cells\n\n!\n\nMatch 2: P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a transporter conferring multidrug resistance (MDR).\n\nMatch 3: Pgp-potentiated toxicity.\n\nMatch 4: Pgp-mediated efflux of NSC297366-iron complexes.\n\nMatch 5: P-glycoprotein (Pgp, MDR1), the product of ABCB1 gene, was shown to be expressed in several drug resistant malignancies, including ovarian carcinoma (3), acute myeloid leukemia (4), chronic myeloid leukemia (5), small cell lung cancer (6), and more (1, 2).\n\nMatch 6: P-glycoprotein expression and function (7) with unfavorable treatment response, it is universally accepted that pharmacologic modulation of the multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype has the potential to significantly increase the efficacy of currently available anticancer therapies.\n\nMatch 7: Pgp inhibitors did not fulfill this expectation, failing to confirm clinical benefit (8).\n\nMatch 8: Abcb1 or Abcg2 genes, and the contribution of drug efflux to drug resistance was also confirmed in ABC transporter-deficient tumors (9).\n\nMatch 9: Pgp expression patterns in the NCI60 cell panel, has led to the discovery of several compounds with robust, Pgp dependent toxic activity across diverse cell line</observation>"
