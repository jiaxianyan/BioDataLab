The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module. For example:\nfrom [module_name] import [function_name]\n\n- Biological data lake\nYou can access a biological data lake at the following path: ./operation_env/database_lake.\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant datasets:\nEach item is listed with its description to help you understand its contents.\n----\n\n----\n\n- Software Library:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant libraries that you can use:\nEach library is listed with its description to help you understand its functionality.\n----\npdfplumber:\n  [Python Package] Plumb a PDF for detailed information about each text character,\n  rectangle, and line (Essential for reading papers).\npytesseract:\n  [Python Package] Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool\n  for python.\npillow:\n  [Python Package] The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities\n  to your Python interpreter.\nbiopython: [Python Package] A set of freely available tools for biological computation.\nrdkit: [Python Package] A collection of cheminformatics and machine learning software.\nlangchain: [Python Package] Building applications with LLMs through composability.\ntransformers:\n  [Python Package] State-of-the-art Machine Learning for Pytorch, TensorFlow, and\n  JAX.\nopenai: [Python Package] The OpenAI Python library.\nanthropic: [Python Package] The Anthropic Python library.\ngoogle-genai: [Python Package] Google Generative AI SDK.\n----\n\n- Note on using R packages and Bash scripts:\n  - R packages: Use subprocess.run(['Rscript', '-e', 'your R code here']) in Python, or use the #!R marker in your execute block.\n  - Bash scripts and commands: Use the #!BASH marker in your execute block for both simple commands and complex shell scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, etc.\n        "

A recent phase 3 study\nshowed that replacing vincristine with an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is a viable approach (Tilly H\net al. N Engl J Med. 2022;386:351-363). Receptor tyrosine kinase\u2013like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is\nan oncofetal protein that is minimally expressed in adult tissues and overexpressed in DLBCL. ZV is an\nADC comprising a humanized IgG1 monoclonal anti-ROR1, a proteolytically cleavable linker, and the\nantimicrotubule agent, monomethyl auristatin E. The single-arm, open-label, phase 2 waveLINE-007\nstudy (NCT05406401) will investigate ZV combined with R-CHP in patients with previously untreated\nDLBCL. Part 1 is being conducted to determine safety and tolerability and recommended phase 2 dose\n(RP2D) of ZV in combination with R-CHP.

A recent phase 3 study\nshowed that replacing vincristine with an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) is a viable approach (Tilly H\net al. N Engl J Med. 2022;386:351-363). Receptor tyrosine kinase\u2013like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is\nan oncofetal protein that is minimally expressed in adult tissues and overexpressed in DLBCL. ZV is an\nADC comprising a humanized IgG1 monoclonal anti-ROR1, a proteolytically cleavable linker, and the\nantimicrotubule agent, monomethyl auristatin E. The single-arm, open-label, phase 2 waveLINE-007\nstudy (NCT05406401) will investigate ZV combined with R-CHP in patients with previously untreated\nDLBCL. Part 1 is being conducted to determine safety and tolerability and recommended phase 2 dose\n(RP2D) of ZV in combination with R-CHP. Part 2 will be conducted to investigate efficacy of ZV at the\nRP2D with R-CHP. Methods: Eligible patients will be $18 years of age and have previously untreated\nhistologically confirmed DLBCL, positron emission tomography (PET)\u2013positive disease verified by\nblinded independent central review (BICR), an ECOG PS of 0 or 1, and adequate organ function.\nPatients diagnosed with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, with a history of transformation of\nindolent disease to DLBCL, or active central nervous system lymphoma will be excluded. Approximately\n60 patients will be enrolled (part 1, n = 45; part 2, n = 15). Part 1 will use a modified toxicity probability\ninterval design to establish the RP2D of ZV when administered with R-CHP. The starting dose of ZV will\nbe 1.75 mg/kg (modified to 1.5, 2.0, 2.25, or 2.5 mg/kg) administered as an intravenous infusion every\n3 weeks (Q3W) in combination with R-CHP. In part 2, an additional 15 patients will receive ZV at RP2D\nplus R-CHP Q3W for up to 6 cycles until disease progression per Lugano 2014 criteria, unacceptable\ntoxicity, or withdrawal. Disease response assessment, computed tomography, and PET will occur at\nbaseline and cycles 3 and 6. Adverse events (AEs) will be monitored up to 30 days after cessation of\ntreatment (90 days for serious AEs, or 30 days if new anticancer therapy is initiated). AEs will be graded\nper National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0. Primary\nend points are safety and tolerability and RP2D for ZV in combination with R-CHP, and complete\nresponse rate per Lugano 2014 criteria as assessed by the investigator. Secondary end points are\nobjective response rate and duration of response per Lugano 2014 criteria by investigator review.\nExploratory end points include progression-free survival per Lugano 2014 criteria by BICR and overall\nsurvival.

We now present safety/efficacy results\nfrom a FIH phase I study of BL-B01D1. Methods: This study included patients (pts) with locally\nadvanced or metastatic solid tumors. For dose escalation (D-ESC, i3+3), BL-B01D1 was administered\nintravenously at doses of 0.27, 1.5, 3.0 mg/kg QW, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5mg/kg D1D8 Q3W or 4.5, 5.0, 6.0 mg/\nkg D1 Q3W. A subset of pts were enrolled into dose-expansion (D-EXP) at Q3W regimens. Results: As of\nDec 31, 2022, 150 pts were enrolled and received at least one dose (D-ESC, n=25; D-EXP, n=125).\nDLTs were neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and thrombocytopenia at 3.0mg/kg QW and 3.5mg/kg\nD1D8 Q3W. The MTDs were determined to be 3.0mg/kg D1D8 Q3W and 6.0mg/kg D1 Q3W. D-EXP was\ncarried out at 2.5, 3.0mg/kg D1D8 Q3W and 4.5, 5.0, 6.0 mg/kg D1 Q3W. 144 pts were enrolled across\nall Q3W dose levels (D-ESC and D-EXP), including 89 NSCLC, 7 SCLC, 27 nasopharyngeal cancer\n(NPC), 19 HNSCC and 2 others. Most common TRAEs (.10%, all grade / $ G3) were leukopenia (60%/\n30%), neutropenia (51%/34%), anemia (45%/15%), thrombocytopenia (44%/19%), alopecia (30%/\n0%), nausea (29%/,1%), vomiting (28%/0%), asthenia (21%/,1%), decreased appetite (22%/\n,1%), asthenia (21%/,1%), hypophagia (16%/0%), diarrhoea (15%/2%), mouth ulceration (15%/\n,1%), rash (13%/0%). No ILD was observed. 122 pts were evaluable for efficacy (at least 1 tumor\nassessment). PK and other details will be updated in the meeting. Conclusions: BL-B01D1 demonstrated encouraging efficacy in heavily pretreated metastatic/locally advanced solid tumors, especially\nin pts with EGFRm NSCLC.

Zilovertamab\nvedotin (ZV) is an antibody-drug conjugate comprising a humanized IgG1 monoclonal anti-ROR1, a\nproteolytically cleavable linker, and the antimicrotubule agent monomethyl auristatin E. Nemtabrutinib\nis a reversible inhibitor of Bruton s tyrosine kinase (BTK). The combination of ZV and a BTKi has the\npotential for improved responses in B-cell malignancies. The waveLINE-006 study (NCT05458297) is\ndesigned to investigate safety and efficacy of ZV as monotherapy or in combination with nemtabrutinib\nin pts with B-cell malignancies. Methods: Eligible pts are $18 years old with biopsy-proven and/or\nhistologically confirmed mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), Richter s transformation (RT), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), or follicular lymphoma (FL), relapsed or refractory (R/R) disease, ECOG\nperformance status of 0 to 2, and adequate organ function (table). Approximately 275 pts will be\nenrolled in 6 cohorts (A-F; see table). In cohorts A and B, patients will receive ZV 2.5 mg/kg IV Q3W. In\ncohort C, 30 patients will be enrolled in a safety run-in phase of ZV in combination with nemtabrutinib,\nthen an additional 15 patients will receive the RP2D of the combination. Patients in cohort D (schedule\noptimization) will be randomized 1:1 to receive ZV 2.5 mg/kg IV Q3W (arm 1) or ZV 2.0 mg/kg IV Q2/3W\n(arm 2). Patients in cohorts E and F (efficacy expansion) will receive the dose and schedule of ZV\ndetermined during schedule optimization. Each recipient of ZV or nemtabrutinib will receive the\nassigned intervention until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other discontinuation criteria\nare met. Tumor scans will be performed at baseline, then Q12W up to week 108, then Q24W thereafter.\nAdverse events (AEs) will be monitored and will be graded per NCI CTCAE version 5. The primary end\npoints are the safety and tolerability of ZV alone (cohort D) and in combination with nemtabrutinib\n(cohort C), and the objective response rate of ZV alone (cohorts A, B, D, E, and F) and in combination\nwith nemtabrutinib (cohort C). The secondary end points are the duration of response of ZV alone\n(cohorts A, B, D, E, and F) and in combination with nemtabrutinib (cohort C) and the safety and\ntolerability of ZV alone (cohorts A, B, E, and F).
