The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module. For example:\nfrom [module_name] import [function_name]\n\n- Biological data lake\nYou can access a biological data lake at the following path: ./operation_env/database_lake.\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant datasets:\nEach item is listed with its description to help you understand its contents.\n----\n\n----\n\n- Software Library:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant libraries that you can use:\nEach library is listed with its description to help you understand its functionality.\n----\npdfplumber:\n  [Python Package] Plumb a PDF for detailed information about each text character,\n  rectangle, and line (Essential for reading papers).\nbeautifulsoup4:\n  [Python Package] Screen-scraping library to extract data from HTML and XML\n  files.\nlangchain: [Python Package] Building applications with LLMs through composability.\ntransformers:\n  [Python Package] State-of-the-art Machine Learning for Pytorch, TensorFlow, and\n  JAX.\nopenai: [Python Package] The OpenAI Python library.\nanthropic: [Python Package] The Anthropic Python library.\ngoogle-genai: [Python Package] Google Generative AI SDK.\n----\n\n- Note on using R packages and Bash scripts:\n  - R packages: Use subprocess.run(['Rscript', '-e', 'your R code here']) in Python, or use the #!R marker in your execute block.\n  - Bash scripts and commands: Use the #!BASH marker in your execute block for both simple commands and complex shell scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, etc.\n        "

We compiled a focused library consisting of  \\(>500\\)  commercially available or newly synthesized 8-hydroxyquinoline (8OHQ) derivatives whose toxicity is paradoxically increased rather than decreased by the activity of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a transporter conferring multidrug resistance (MDR). Here, we deciphered the mechanism of action of NSC297366 that shows exceptionally strong Pgp-potentiated toxicity. Treatment of cells with NSC297366 resulted in changes associated with the activity of potent anticancer iron chelators.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n</observation>"

To increase the scope of structurally related MDR-selective com\n\npounds, we compiled a focused library consisting of  \\(>500\\)  commercially available or newly synthesized 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives and screened the compounds using the parental MES-SA and the multidrug resistant MES-SA/DX5 cell lines. This screening effort has confirmed the relevance of the 8-hydroxyquinoline backbone in MDR-selective toxicity, and the requirement of functional Pgp to mediate sensitization of MDR cells (Fig. 1A). NSC297366, in which the 8OHQ substructure is embedded into a ring is one of the highly active derivatives, and thus was chosen to characterize the mechanism of action of MDR-selective toxicity (results obtained with 4 additional MDR-selective 8OHQ derivatives are shown in Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). To explore the specific contribution and the functional relevance of P-glycoprotein in collateral sensitivity to NSC297366, we generated MES-SA/B1 cells by lentiviral transduction of MES-SA cells with an expression vector encoding human MDR1 cDNA. Using this isogenic cell line pair, we confirmed that the moderate expression of P-glycoprotein in MES-SA/B1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A-S2C) is sufficient to confer resistance to doxorubicin as well as increased sensitivity to NSC297366 (Fig. 1B). Both phenotypes were fully reversed by the specific Pgp inhibitor tariquidar, showing the reliance of collateral sensitivity on P-glycoprotein function. Notably, MDR-selective toxicity was not restricted to MES-SA/B1 cells. NSC297366 proved to preferentially target several further MDR cell lines with variable Pgp expression and different tissue of \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n</observation>"

Our prior work has identified several compounds whose toxicity is increased, rather than decreased by the activity of P-glycoprotein. We have shown that the function of Pgp is both necessary and sufficient to induce collateral sensitivity in MDR cells. That Pgp is necessary was evidenced by the loss of collateral sensitivity in the presence of specific efflux inhibitors; that Pgp is sufficient was demonstrated by the persistent MDR-selective toxicity of the compounds across diverse MDR cell lines (Supplementary Table S2; Supplementary Fig. S5) (14). However, the mechanism of action of MDR-selective compounds targeting multidrug resistant cells has remained a mystery. The results presented in this study clearly delineate a series of cellular events originating from the Pgp-mediated efflux of iron complexes, leading to the selective depletion of intracellular iron and the eventual elimination of MDR cells.\n\nSeveral theories have been put forward to explain the paradoxical sensitization effect of Pgp. It has been hypothesized that high affinity\n\n![](images/68b34e0073da7dc75bbe90b9d7c975784529ef6d79061f293bafe62811b83eb0.jpg)  \nA  \nC  \nB\n\n![](images/75359881678c90b58a3eb0af675a34c5a1e3eec00299d7e2c559ee64d74e8764.jpg)  \nFigure 5.\n\nNSC279366 Tariqidar  \n![](images/902c12b199a68ebc30944e26ae417300505f5fb30df4daef3bf1ef0bf95da45b.jpg)  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n</observation>"
