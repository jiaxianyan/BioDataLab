Given a pdf content file `benchmark/dataset/CovPDB/pdf_content.md`. 

Determining the covalent bonding mechanisms based on the given paper. 

The mechanisms must be one of: Aziridine Opening; Beta-Lactam Addition; Borylation; Composite Reaction; Cyclohemiaminoacetalization; Disulfide Formation; Epoxide Opening; Hemiaminalization; Hemi(thio)acetalization; Imidazolidinone Opening; Imine Condensation; Lactone Addition; Michael Addition; Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution; Nucleophilic Addition to a Double Bond; Nucleophilic Addition to a Triple Bond; Nucleophilic Aliphatic Subsititution; Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution; Phosphorylation; Ring Opening; Sulfonylation

Saving the mechanisms into `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_pred_results/Vendor2/Claude-4.5-Sonnet/covpdb_annotate.txt`.  

# Output Format (For Reference)
Sulfonylation

# Intermediate Results
All intermediate files generated should be saved in the directly `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_tmp/Vendor2/Claude-4.5-Sonnet/covpdb_annotate`

I'll help you determine the covalent bonding mechanism from the PDF content and save the result. Let me start by creating a plan.

## Plan

1. [ ] Read the PDF content from the markdown file
2. [ ] Analyze the content to identify the covalent bonding mechanism
3. [ ] Match the mechanism to one of the allowed categories
4. [ ] Create necessary directories for intermediate and final results
5. [ ] Save the identified mechanism to the output file

Let me begin by reading the PDF content:

ABSTRACT: Golgi mannosidase II (GMII) catalyzes the sequential hydrolysis of two mannosyl residues from  \(\mathrm{GlcNAc}\) \(\mathrm{Man}_5\mathrm{GlcNAc}_2\)  to produce  \(\mathrm{GlcNAcMan}_3\mathrm{GlcNAc}_2,\)  the precursor for all complex  \(N\cdot\)  glycans, including the branched  \(N\cdot\)  glycans associated with cancer. Inhibitors of GMII are potential cancer therapeutics, but their usefulness is limited by off- target effects, which produce  \(\alpha\)  - mannosidosis- like symptoms. Despite many structural and mechanistic studies of GMII, we still lack a potent and selective inhibitor of this enzyme. Here, we synthesized manno- epicyclophellitol epoxide and aziridines and demonstrate their covalent modification and time- dependent inhibition of GMII. Application of fluorescent manno- epi- cyclophellitol aziridine derivatives enabled activity- based protein profiling of  \(\alpha\)  - mannosidases from both human cell lysate and mouse tissue extracts. Synthesized probes also facilitated a fluorescence polarization- based screen for dGMII inhibitors. We identified seven previously unknown inhibitors of GMII from a library of over 350 iminosugars and investigated their binding modalities thr

=== Analysis ===
Based on the PDF content:
1. The paper mentions 'manno-epicyclophellitol epoxide and aziridines'
2. Key quote: 'opening of the aziridine ring resulting from nucleophilic attack'
3. Figure 3 shows 'Mechanism of covalent inhibition of α-mannosidase by manno-epi-cyclophellitols'
4. The mechanism involves ring opening through nucleophilic attack

The paper discusses BOTH epoxide and aziridine compounds, but the structural
evidence and detailed mechanism focuses on AZIRIDINE OPENING.

## Summary

I have successfully analyzed the PDF content and determined the covalent bonding mechanism. The paper describes manno-epi-cyclophellitol compounds that act as covalent inhibitors of α-mannosidases. While both epoxide and aziridine compounds were synthesized, the primary mechanism demonstrated with structural evidence is **Aziridine Opening**, as shown by:

- X-ray crystal structure explicitly showing "opening of the aziridine ring"
- Nucleophilic attack at the pseudoanomeric carbon
- Aziridine being 100-fold more potent than epoxide
- Figure 3 specifically focusing on the aziridine mechanism

The result has been saved to the required output file.
