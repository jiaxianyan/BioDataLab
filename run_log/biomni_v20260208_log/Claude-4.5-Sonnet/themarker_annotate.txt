Given txt file containing biomarkers and their functions in the file `benchmark/dataset/TheMarker/biomarker.txt`. 

According to the roles of these biomarkers played, labelled the biomarkers as pharmacodynamic biomarker (PDY), safety biomarker (SAF), monitoring biomarker (MOI), predictive biomarker (PRD) and surrogate endpoint (SUR). 

Saving the classification list [label_1, label_2, ...] in the same sort as input file to json file `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_pred_results/Vendor2/Claude-4.5-Sonnet/themarker_annotate.json`. 

The output format example is as follows:
["PDY", "SAF", "MOI", "PRD", "SUR"]

All intermediate results should be saved in `/root/biodatalab/log/biomni_v20260209_tmp/Vendor2/Claude-4.5-Sonnet/themarker_annotate` directory.

I'll help you classify biomarkers based on their functions. Let me start by creating a plan and then executing it step by step.

## Plan

1. [ ] Read and examine the biomarker data from the input file
2. [ ] Create necessary output directories
3. [ ] Analyze biomarker functions and classify them into the 5 categories
4. [ ] Save the classification results to the JSON file
5. [ ] Verify the output

Let me start by examining the input file:

<execute>
# Read the biomarker file
with open('benchmark/dataset/TheMarker/biomarker.txt', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()

# Display first 2000 characters to understand the structure

print(content[:2000])
print("\n" + "="*50)
print(f"Total length: {len(content)} characters")

Laminin-5 is thought to be involved in cell adhesion via integrin alpha-3/beta-1 in focal adhesion and integrin alpha-6/beta-4 in hemidesmosomes, signal transduction via tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125-FAK and p80, differentiation of keratinocytes.
B36BFV	IL2 mRNA	IL2	Interleukin-2 mRNA; IL-2 mRNA; T-cell growth factor mRNA; TCGF mRNA	mRNA	Cytokine produced by activated CD4-positive helper T-cells and to a lesser extend activated CD8-positive T-cells and natural killer cells that plays pivotal roles in the immune response and tolerance. Binds to a receptor complex composed of either the high-affinity trimeric IL-2R or the low-affinity dimeric IL-2R. Interaction with the receptor leads to oligomerization and conformation changes in the IL-2R subunits resulting in downstream signaling starting with phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3. In turn, JAK1 and JAK3 phosphorylate the receptor to form a docking site leading to the phosphorylation of several substrates including STAT5. This process leads to activation of several pathways including STAT, phosphoinositide-3-kinase/PI3K and mitogen-activated protein kinase/MAPK pathways. Functions as a T-cell growth factor and can increase NK-cell cytolytic activity as well. Promotes strong proliferation of activated B-cells and subsequently immunoglobulin production. Plays a pivotal role in regulating the adaptive immune system by controlling the survival and proliferation of regulatory

================================================================================
Biomarker 1:
ID: B07XCZ
Name: Laminin subunit alpha-3
Gene: LAMA3; LAMNA
Class: Protein
Function: Binding to cells via a high affinity receptor, laminin is thought to mediate the attachment, migration and organization of cells into tissues during embryonic development by interacting with other extracellular matrix components. Laminin-5 is thought to be involved in cell adhesion via integrin alpha-3/beta-1 in focal adhesion and integrin alpha-6/beta-4 in hemidesmosomes, signal transduction via tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125-FAK and p80, differentiation of keratinocytes.

================================================================================
Biomarker 2:
ID: B36BFV
Name: IL2 mRNA
Gene: IL2
Class: mRNA
Function: Cytokine produced by activated CD4-positive helper T-cells and to a lesser extend activated CD8-positive T-cells and natural killer cells that plays pivotal roles in the immune response and tolerance. Binds to a receptor complex composed of either the high-affinity trimeric IL-2R or the low-affinity dimeric IL-2R. Interaction with the receptor leads to oligomerization and conformation changes in the IL-2R subunits resulting in downstream signaling starting with phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3. In turn, JAK1 and JAK3 phosphorylate the receptor to form a docking site leading to the phosphorylation of several substrates including STAT5. This process leads to activation of several pathways including STAT, phosphoinositide-3-kinase/PI3K and mitogen-activated protein kinase/MAPK pathways. Functions as a T-cell growth factor and can increase NK-cell cytolytic activity as well. Promotes strong proliferation of activated B-cells and subsequently immunoglobulin production. Plays a pivotal role in regulating the adaptive immune system by controlling the survival and proliferation of regulatory T-cells, which are required for the maintenance of immune tolerance. Moreover, participates in the differentiation and homeostasis of effector T-cell subsets, including Th1, Th2, Th17 as well as memory CD8-positive T-cells.

================================================================================
Biomarker 3:
ID: B12RGS
Name: Clusterin
Gene: CLU; APOJ; CLI; KUB1; AAG4
Class: Protein
Function: Functions as extracellular chaperone that prevents aggregation of non native proteins. Prevents stress-induced aggregation of blood plasma proteins. Inhibits formation of amyloid fibrils by APP, APOC2, B2M, CALCA, CSN3, SNCA and aggregation-prone LYZ variants. Does not require ATP. Maintains partially unfolded proteins in a state appropriate for subsequent refolding by other chaperones, such as HSPA8/HSC70. Does not refold proteins by itself. Binding to cell surface receptors triggers internalization of the chaperone-client complex and subsequent lysosomal or proteasomal degradation. Protects cells against apoptosis and against cytolysis by complement. Intracellular forms interact with ubiquitin and SCF E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes and promote the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. Promotes proteasomal degradation of COMMD1 and IKBKB. Modulates NF-kappa-B transcriptional activity. A mitochondrial form suppresses BAX-dependent release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm and inhibit apoptosis. Plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation. An intracellular form suppresses stress-induced apoptosis by stabilizing mitochondrial membrane integrity through interaction with HSPA5. Secreted form does not affect caspase or BAX-mediated intrinsic apoptosis and TNF-induced NF-kappa-B-activity. Secreted form act as an important modulator during neuronal differentiation through interaction with STMN3. Plays a role in the clearance of immune complexes that arise during cell injury. Does not affect caspase or BAX-mediated intrinsic apoptosis and TNF-induced NF-kappa-B-activity. Does not affect caspase or BAX-mediated intrinsic apoptosis and TNF-induced NF-kappa-B-activity. Promotes cell death through interaction with BCL2L1 that releases and activates BAX.

================================================================================
Biomarker 4:
ID: B1W4DT
Name: Urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor
Gene: PLAUR; MO3; UPAR
Class: Protein
Function: Acts as a receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator. Plays a role in localizing and promoting plasmin formation. Mediates the proteolysis-independent signal transduction activation effects of U-PA. It is subject to negative-feedback regulation by U-PA which cleaves it into an inactive form.

   differentiation processes, indicating tissue integrity and cellular 
   organization status during disease progression or treatment.

2. B36BFV - IL2 mRNA
   Classification: PDY (Pharmacodynamic Biomarker)
   Rationale: Measures pharmacodynamic effects on the immune system, 
   particularly T-cell activation, proliferation, and survival in response 
   to treatment. Directly reflects drug action on immune response.

3. B12RGS - Clusterin
   Classification: SAF (Safety Biomarker)
   Rationale: Monitors cellular stress, protein misfolding, and apoptosis - 
   key safety indicators for potential adverse effects. Functions as a 
   protective marker against cellular damage.

4. B1W4DT - Urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor
   Classification: PRD (Predictive Biomarker)
   Rationale: Predicts proteolytic activity and potential for cellular 
   invasion/migration. Useful for predicting treatment response based on 
   receptor-mediated signaling and plasmin formation capacity.
