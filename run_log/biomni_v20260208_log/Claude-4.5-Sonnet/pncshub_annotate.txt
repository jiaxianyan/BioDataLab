## Summary

Tuberculosis remains a severe worldwide health threat. A thorough understanding of Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenesis will facilitate the development of new treatments for tuberculosis. Numerous bacterial pathogens possess specialized protein secretion systems that are dedicated to the export of virulence factors. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is part of a developing group of pathogenic bacteria that share the uncommon property of possessing two secA genes (secA1 and secA2). In mycobacteria, SecA1 is the essential 'housekeeping' SecA protein whereas SecA2 is an accessory secretion factor. Here we demonstrate that SecA2 contributes to the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis. A deletion of the secA2 gene in M. tuberculosis attenuates the virulence of the organism in mice. By comparing the profile of proteins secreted by wild-type M. tuberculosis and the  \(\Delta\) secA2 mutant, we identified superoxide dismutase A (SodA) as a protein dependent on SecA2 for secretion. SodA lacks a classical signal sequence for protein export. Our data suggests that SecA2-dependent export is a new type of secretion pathway that is part of a virulence mechanism of M. tuberculosis to elude the oxidative attack of macrophages.

## Introduction

It is well established that protein export pathways play an important role in bacterial pathogenesis. The majority of bacterial virulence factors are exported (secreted and surface) proteins and, accordingly, the systems responsible for their export are critical to virulence (Finlay and Falkow, 1997). The Sec-dependent protein export pathway is conserved throughout bacteria and it is responsible for translocating precursor proteins containing classical amino-terminal signal sequences across the cytoplasmic membrane (Danese and Silhavy, 1998). The Sec signal sequences are comprised of a tripartite domain structure: a charged amino-terminus, a hydrophobic core and a polar region containing a site for cleavage by a signal peptidase (Pugsley, 1993). An essential protein in the Sec-pathway is the SecA ATPase which interacts with virtually all the other components of the system including the translocating protein, chaperones, phospholipids and integral membrane proteins (SecY and SecE) that along with SecA comprise the translocase channel (Oliver, 1993). Pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria utilize this pathway to localize proteins to the cell surface or as the first step in secreting proteins out of the cell (Lee and Schneewind, 2001). Many bacterial pathogens also possess specialized protein export systems dedicated to the secretion of virulence factors (Harper and Silhavy, 2001; Lee and Schneewind, 2001). In some of these systems (Types I and III) the secreted protein does not contain a classical Sec signal sequence. The unique targeting motifs on proteins secreted by these specialized secretion pathways remain the subject of investigation (Jarchau et al., 1994; Aldridge and Hughes, 2001).

Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium responsible for tuberculosis, accounts for nearly two million deaths each year (World Health Organization, 2002). There is a desperate need for new antituberculosis strategies to be developed. A central feature of the virulence of M. tuberculosis is that the bacillus survives and grows within macrophages. An understanding of the mechanisms employed by M. tuberculosis to survive the antimicrobial attack of macrophages [reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI), reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI), phagosome acidification, and phagosome-lysosome fusion] would

facilitate development of new approaches for controlling tuberculosis. As in other bacterial pathogens, the exported proteins of  \(M.\)  tuberculosis are among the first molecules to interact with the host and we hypothesize that protein export is critical to virulence, possibly by serving to modify the hostile macrophage environment. Mycobacteria possess homologues of the Sec-pathway components but do not have obvious homologues of factors involved in the specialized types of secretion pathways referred to above (Braunstein and Belisle, 2000). However, mycobacteria are part of a developing group of Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria that share the uncommon property of possessing multiple secA genes (secA1 and secA2) in their genomes (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus gordonii, Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus anthracis) (Mazmanian et al., 2001; The Institute for Genomic Research, 2001; 2002; Bensing and Sullam, 2002; Lenz and Portnoy, 2002). We showed previously in  \(M.\)  smegmatis that SecA1 is an essential 'housekeeping' SecA while SecA2 is a non-essential accessory secretion factor which functions in protein export (Braunstein et al., 2001). The 'extra' SecA in these bacteria may be part of a new type of specialized secretion pathway that functions in bacterial pathogenesis. This idea is supported by the recent demonstrations that the accessory SecA in  \(L.\)  monocytogenes, SecA2, contributes to virulence and the accessory sec locus (secA2 and secY2) in  \(S.\)  gordonii exports an adhesin for platelet binding (Bensing and Sullam, 2002; Lenz and Portnoy, 2002).

In this report we demonstrate that SecA2 functions in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis. Furthermore, we show that SecA2 is required for the optimal secretion of superoxide dismutase (SodA) and catalase-peroxidase (KatG). Both of these proteins are synthesized without Sec signal sequences and function to detoxify reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI). This work suggests that SecA2 is part of a specialized secretion system that contributes to the virulence of M. tuberculosis by countering the oxidative attack of the host.

## Results

### Deletion of secA2 in M. tuberculosis

The genome of M. tuberculosis possesses two open reading frames (secA1 and secA2) that encode homologues of the SecA protein (Cole et al., 1998; Braunstein et al., 2001). We previously deleted the secA2 gene of M. smegmatis, a fast-growing and non-pathogenic mycobacteria (Braunstein et al., 2001). In order to assess the role that SecA2 plays in pathogenesis, we constructed an in frame and unmarked deletion of secA2 in the virulent H37Rv strain of M. tuberculosis. An allelic exchange strategy

## Updated Plan

1. [✓] Read the paper content from the specified markdown file
2. [✓] Search for information about katG and its pathway type
3. [✓] Analyze the content to determine which of the 8 pathway types it belongs to
4. [✓] Save the result to the specified output file

## Summary

I have successfully completed the task of determining the Pathway Type of katG based on the paper content. Here's what I found:

**Paper Title:** "SecA2 functions in the secretion of superoxide dismutase A and in the virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis"

**Key Findings:**
- The paper explicitly focuses on the SecA2-dependent secretion pathway
- KatG (catalase-peroxidase) is mentioned 16 times in the paper
- The paper demonstrates that SecA2 is required for the optimal secretion of both SodA (superoxide dismutase A) and KatG (catalase-peroxidase)
- Both proteins are synthesized without classical Sec signal sequences
- SecA2 is described as an accessory secretion factor in Mycobacterium tuberculosis

**Determination:**
Given the eight pathway types (FPE, FEA, Holins, MVs, SecA2, T7SS, ABC transporter, Unknown), the paper clearly indicates that katG is secreted via the **SecA2-dependent pathway**.

The answer is <solution>SecA2</solution>
