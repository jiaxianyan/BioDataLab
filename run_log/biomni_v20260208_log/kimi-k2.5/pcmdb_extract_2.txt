There are three paper contents `example_1.md, example_2.md, example_3.md` in the directory `benchmark/dataset/PCMDB`. 

Filter out the paper research contain cell marker inferred through biological experiments, including GFP reporter systems, GUS gene reporter systems and western blotting. 

Saving the keeped paper name list in the `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/kimi-k2.5/pcmdb_extract_2.json`. 

Output format: A JSON file with the following format:
[name_1, name_2, ...] 

Paper name must not contain suffix.

All intermediate results should be save in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/kimi-k2.5pcmdb_extract_2` directory.

I'll help you filter papers containing cell marker inference through biological experiments. Let me start by creating a plan and reading the paper contents.

## Plan:
1. [ ] Read all three paper files from `benchmark/dataset/PCMDB`
2. [ ] Analyze each paper for cell marker inference using biological experiments (GFP, GUS, western blotting)
3. [ ] Filter and identify papers to keep
4. [ ] Create intermediate directory and save analysis results
5. [ ] Save final JSON output with filtered paper names

Let me start by reading the paper contents:

<execute>
import os
import json

# Define paths
base_dir = "benchmark/dataset/PCMDB"
output_dir = "/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/kimi-k2.5pcmdb_extract_2"
final_output = "/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/kimi-k2.5/pcmdb_extract_2.json"

# Create intermediate directory if it doesn't exist
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Read all paper files
paper_files = ["example_1.md", "example_2.md", "example_3.md"]
papers_content = {}

for paper in paper_files:
    filepath = os.path.join(base_dir, paper)
    with open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        content = f.read()
        papers_content[paper] = content
        print(f"\n{'='*60}")
        print(f"Paper: {paper}")
        print(f"{'='*60}")

The 2022 World No-Tobacco Day campaign focuses on tobacco's threat to the environment (1). It aims to raise awareness on the environmental impact of tobacco throughout its lifecycle, demonstrating its destructive impact not only on human health, but also on the environment and the planet (1). It also aims to expose efforts of the tobacco industry to "greenwash" their reputation and products by increasingly portraying their activities as environmentally friendly (2).

The campaign messages demonstrate the varied ways that tobacco cultivation, production, distribution, consumption, and post-consumer waste threaten the environment (2). Tobacco destroys forests, harms the soil, affects water supply, pollutes the air, and contributes to

## Abstract

Introduction: Tobacco couponing continues to be part of contemporary tobacco marketing in the United States. We performed a systematic review of the evidence of tobacco product coupon receipt and redemption to inform regulation.

Aims and Methods: We searched EMBASE OVID and Medline databases for observational (cross-sectional and longitudinal) studies that examined the prevalence of tobacco coupon receipt and coupon redemption across different subpopulations, as well as studies of the association between coupon receipt and redemption with tobacco initiation and cessation at foll

## Abstract

Background: Polyploidy provides new genetic material that facilitates evolutionary novelty, species adaptation, and crop domestication. Polyploidy often leads to an increase in cell or organism size, which may affect transcript abundance or transcriptome size, but the relationship between polyploidy and transcriptome changes remains poorly understood. Plant cells often undergo endoreduplication, confounding the polyploid effect.

Results: To mitigate these effects, we select female gametic cells that are developmentally stable and void of endoreduplication. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) in Arabidopsis thaliana tetraploid lines and isogenic diploids, we show that transcriptome abundance doubles in the egg cell and increases approximately 1.6-fold in the central cell, consistent with cell size changes. In the central cell of tetraploid plants, DEMETER (DME) is upregulated, which can activate PRC2 family members FIS2 and MEA, and may suppress the expression of other genes. Upregulation of cell size regulators in tetraploids, including TOR and OSR2, may increase the size of reproductive cells. In diploids, the order of transcriptome abundance is central cell, synergic cell, and egg cell, consistent with their cell size variation. Remarka

Papers to KEEP (no cell marker experiments): ['example_1', 'example_2']

Verified content: ['example_1', 'example_2']

Let me verify the final output file and confirm the task is complete:

<execute>
# Final verification
import os
import json

final_output = "/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/kimi-k2.5/pcmdb_extract_2.json"

# Check if file exists and verify content
if os.path.exists(final_output):
    with open(final_output, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        content = json.load(f)
    print(f"✓ Output file exists: {final_output}")
    print(f"✓ Content: {content}")
    print(f"✓ Number of papers kept: {len(content)}")
    print(f"✓ File size: {os.path.getsize(final_output)} bytes")
else:
    print("✗ Output file does not exist!")

# Verify intermediate files exist
intermediate_dir = "/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/kimi-k2.5pcmdb_extract_2"
if os.path.exists(intermediate_dir):
    files = os.listdir(intermediate_dir)
    print(f"\n✓ Intermediate directory exists: {intermediate_dir}")
    print(f"✓ Intermediate files: {files}")
</execute>
<observation>✓ Output file exists: /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/kimi-k2.5/pcmdb_extract_2.json
✓ Content: ['example_1', 'example_2']
✓ Number of papers kept: 2
✓ File size: 32 bytes

✓ Intermediate directory exists: /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/kimi-k2.5pcmdb_extract_2
✓ Intermediate files: ['paper_analysis.json']
</observation>
## Plan Status:

1. [✓] Read all three paper files from `benchmark/dataset/PCMDB`
2. [✓] Analyze each paper for cell marker inference using biological experiments (GFP, GUS, western blotting)
3. [✓] Filter and identify papers to keep
4. [✓] Create intermediate directory and save analysis results
5. [✓] Save final JSON output with filtered paper names

## Analysis Summary:

| Paper | GFP | GUS | Western Blot | Decision |
|-------|-----|-----|--------------|----------|
| example_1.md | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | **KEEP** |
| example_2.md | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | **KEEP** |
| example_3.md | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | **REMOVE** |

**Paper 3 (example_3.md)** was filtered out because it contains GFP reporter system usage:
> "We generated two cell-specific lines that each expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the diploid or isogenic tetraploid A. thaliana"

Papers 1 and 2 were kept as they focus on tobacco's environmental/health impact and tobacco couponing systematic review respectively, without any cell marker biological experiments.
