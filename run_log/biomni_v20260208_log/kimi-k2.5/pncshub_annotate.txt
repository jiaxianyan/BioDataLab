## Summary

Tuberculosis remains a severe worldwide health threat. A thorough understanding of Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenesis will facilitate the development of new treatments for tuberculosis. Numerous bacterial pathogens possess specialized protein secretion systems that are dedicated to the export of virulence factors. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is part of a developing group of pathogenic bacteria that share the uncommon property of possessing two secA genes (secA1 and secA2). In mycobacteria, SecA1 is the essential 'housekeeping' SecA protein whereas SecA2 is an accessory secretion factor. Here we demonstrate that SecA2 contributes to the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis. A deletion of the secA2 gene in M. tuberculosis attenuates the virulence of the organism in mice. By comparing the profile of proteins secreted by wild-type M. tuberculosis and the  \(\Delta\) secA2 mutant, we identified superoxide dismutase A (SodA) as a protein dependent on SecA2 for secretion. SodA lacks a classical signal sequence for protein export. Our data suggests that SecA2-dependent export is a new type of secretion pathway that is part of a virulence mechanism of M. tuberculosis to elude the oxidative attack of macrophages.

om BioResources) and eluted with an increasing acetonitrile gradient using a MicroPro capillary HPLC system (Eldex Laboratories). The RP effluent was introduced directly into a Finnigan LCQ (Thermoquest) electrospray mass spectrometer, and the peptides were analysed by MS or MS/MS. The electrospray needle was operated at  \(4 \mathrm{kV}\)  with a sheath gas flow of  \(\mathsf{N}_{2}\)  at 40 p.s.i. and a capillary temperature of  \(200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) . MS/MS was automatically performed on the most dominant ion of the previous MS scan and the collision energy was set at  \(40\%\) . MS/MS data of the peptides were matched to M. tuberculosis proteins using the SEQUEST software (Eng et al., 1994; Yates et al., 1995). The SEQUEST software was set to consider the oxidation of methionine (+16.0) and the acrylamide modification of cysteine (+71.0).

### Immunoblot analysis

Culture filtrate proteins (CFP) and whole cell lysates (WCL) were subject to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The amount of protein loaded for each immunoblot was the following:  \(15\mu \mathrm{g}\)  CFP,  \(15\mu \mathrm{g}\)  WCL for anti-SodA;  \(12\mu \mathrm{g}\)  CFP,  \(20\mu \mathrm{g}\)  WCL for anti-KatG;  \(10\mu \mathrm{g}\)  CFP,  \(10\mu \mathrm{g}\)  WCL for anti-PhoS1;  \(12\mu \mathrm{g}\)  CFP,  \(20\mu \mathrm{g}\)  WCL for anti-DnaK,  \(20\mu \mathrm{g}\)  CFP,  \(20\mu \mathrm{g}\)  WCL for anti-Acr; and  \(15\mu \mathrm{g}\)  CFP,  \(15\mu \mathrm{g}\)  WCL for anti-GroEL. The antibodies used include CS-18 ( \(\alpha\) -SodA), IT-42 ( \(\alpha\) -KatG), IT-23 ( \(\alpha\) -PhoS1), IT-41 ( \(\alpha\) -DnaK), IT-20 ( \(\alpha\) -Acr), IT-56 ( \(\alpha\) -GroEL) at dilutions of 1:50 (Hunter et al., 1990; Sonnenberg and Belisle, 1997). Immunoblots were developed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and NitroBlue Tetrazolium (Sigma).

SecA2

The pathway type of katG is **SecA2** based on the following evidence from the paper:

1. **Direct statement**: "SecA2 is required for the optimal secretion of superoxide dismutase (SodA) and catalase-peroxidase (KatG)"

2. **Section heading**: The paper has a dedicated section titled "**KatG release is dependent on SecA2**"

3. **Explicit conclusion**: "Our identification of SodA and KatG as being dependent on SecA2 for extracellular release"

4. **Experimental evidence**: "The culture filtrates produced from early growth periods (day 3) revealed that KatG release is also dependent on SecA2"

The paper demonstrates that KatG, like SodA, lacks a classical signal sequence for Sec-dependent translocation but is exported through a SecA2-dependent unconventional protein export pathway.
