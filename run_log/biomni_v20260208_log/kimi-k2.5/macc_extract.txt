# Core Task
  Retrieve the abstracts for the articles with PMIDs 19033652, 19949098, and 10483897, and extract all instances of Metabolite-associated cell communications (MACC pairs). Each extracted MACC pair must be formatted as a csv file containing exactly the following fields: "PMID", "Cell", "Interaction", "Metabolite", and "Disease".

# Output Requirements & File Path
  - Output format: A CSV file with the following columns (exactly matching the ground truth CSV headers). Use "N/A" for missing values.
    - `PMID`: The PubMed ID of the article.
    - `Cell`: The specific cell type described (e.g., "Macrophage", "Neuron").
    - `Interaction`: The nature of the interaction (e.g., "Secrete", "Inhibit").
    - `Metabolite`: The name of the metabolite involved (e.g., "Glucose", "ATP").
    - `Disease`: The disease context (e.g., "Diabetes", "Cancer").
  - Save Path: Save the complete list to: `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/kimi-k2.5/macc_extract.csv`
  - Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/kimi-k2.5/macc_extract/`

# Example Output (For Reference Only)
PMID,Cell,Interaction,Metabolite,Disease
22222222,Hepatocyte,Synthesize,Urea,Liver Failure
33333333,Adipocyte,Store,Lipid,Obesity

I'll help you retrieve the abstracts and extract MACC pairs from those PubMed articles. Let me start by creating a plan and executing it step by step.

## Plan:
1. [ ] Create necessary directories for output and intermediate files
2. [ ] Fetch abstracts for PMIDs 19033652, 19949098, and 10483897 using NCBI Entrez
3. [ ] Extract MACC pairs from each abstract by analyzing cell-metabolite interactions
4. [ ] Format results as CSV with required columns
5. [ ] Save the final CSV to the specified path

Let me start:

os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
os.makedirs(temp_dir, exist_ok=True)

print("Directories created:")
print(f"Output: {output_dir}")

Title: Tumor metabolism: cancer cells give and take lactate.
Abstract: Tumors contain well-oxygenated (aerobic) and poorly oxygenated (hypoxic) regions, which were thought to utilize glucose for oxidative and glycolytic metabolism, respectively.

PMID: 19033652
Full Abstract: Tumors contain well-oxygenated (aerobic) and poorly oxygenated (hypoxic) regions, which were thought to utilize glucose for oxidative and glycolytic metabolism, respectively. In this issue of the JCI, Sonveaux et al. show that human cancer cells cultured under hypoxic conditions convert glucose to lactate and extrude it, whereas aerobic cancer cells take up lactate via monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) and utilize it for oxidative phosphorylation (see the related article beginning on page 3930). When MCT1 is inhibited, aerobic cancer cells take up glucose rather than lactate, and hypoxic cancer cells die due to glucose deprivation. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with an inhibitor of MCT1 retarded tumor growth. MCT1 expression was detected exclusively in nonhypoxic regions of human cancer biopsy samples, and in combination, these data suggest that MCT1 inhibition holds potential as a novel cancer therapy.

Full Abstract: Excessive production of aldosterone leads to the development of hypertension and cardiovascular disease by generating an inflammatory state that can be promoted by T cell immunity. Because nature and intensity of T cell responses is controlled by dendritic cells (DCs), it is important to evaluate whether the function of these cells can be modulated by aldosterone. In this study we show that aldosterone augmented the activation of CD8(+) T cells in a DC-dependent fashion. Consistently, the mineralocorticoid receptor was expressed by DCs, which showed activation of MAPK pathway and secreted IL-6 and TGF-beta in response to aldosterone. In addition, DCs stimulated with aldosterone impose a Th17 phenotype to CD4(+) T cells, which have recently been associated with the promotion of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Accordingly, we observed that aldosterone enhances the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an autoimmune disease promoted by Th17 cells. In addition, blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor prevented all aldosterone effects on DCs and attenuated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis development in aldosterone-treated mice. Our data suggest that modulation of DC function by aldosterone enhances CD8(+) T cell activation and promotes Th17-polarized immune responses, which might contribute to the inflammatory damage leading to hypertension and cardiovascular disease.

Full Abstract: New strategies for immunonutritional support include administration of special nutrients such as glutamine. Glutamine is important in several key metabolic processes of immune cells and enterocytes. Exogenous glutamine augments the functions of lymphocytes and macrophages. Neutrophils also reportedly utilize glutamine at a significant rate. Our recent studies demonstrated that glutamine enhances neutrophil function. This article focuses on the effects of glutamine on neutrophil function in surgical stress. Enteral glutamine administration enhanced peritoneal and hepatic bacterial clearance in our rat peritonitis model. Furthermore, IV glutamine supplementation improved the outcome of animals with severe surgical stress. Our in vitro study revealed that supplemental glutamine augmented the bacterial killing function of neutrophils from postoperative patients. Glutamine increased phagocytosis of the neutrophils. In addition, glutamine dose-dependently increased production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) by neutrophils. Thus, our studies suggest that glutamine supplementation may improve bactericidal function of neutrophils by increasing both phagocytosis and ROI production. In conclusion, glutamine plays an important role in neutrophil function. Glutamine may be useful for the prevention, and treatment, of severe infection in critical illness and trauma.

<solution>
I have successfully retrieved the abstracts for all three PMIDs and extracted Metabolite-associated cell communications (MACC pairs) from each. 

The final CSV file has been saved to: `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/kimi-k2.5/macc_extract.csv`

**Extracted MACC Pairs Summary:**

**PMID 19033652** (Cancer metabolism):
- Cancer cells (hypoxic) → Convert/Produce → Lactate → Cancer
- Cancer cells (aerobic) → Take up/Utilize → Lactate → Cancer

**PMID 19949098** (Aldosterone and immune function):
- Dendritic cells → Secrete → IL-6 → Hypertension
- Dendritic cells → Secrete → TGF-beta → Hypertension

**PMID 10483897** (Glutamine immunonutrition):
- Lymphocytes → Function augmented by → Glutamine → Severe infection
- Macrophages → Function augmented by → Glutamine → Severe infection
- Neutrophils → Utilize → Glutamine → Severe infection
- Neutrophils → Produce → Reactive oxygen intermediates → Severe infection

Total: 8 MACC pairs extracted from the three articles, formatted with the required columns (PMID, Cell, Interaction, Metabolite, Disease).
