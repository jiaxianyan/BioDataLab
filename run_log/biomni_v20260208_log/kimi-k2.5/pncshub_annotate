A thorough understanding of Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenesis will facilitate the development of new treatments for tuberculosis. Numerous bacterial pathogens possess specialized protein secretion systems that are dedicated to the export of virulence factors. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is part of a developing group of pathogenic bacteria that share the uncommon property of possessing two secA genes (secA1 and secA2). In mycobacteria, SecA1 is the essential 'housekeeping' SecA protein whereas SecA2 is an accessory secretion factor. Here we demonstrate that SecA2 contributes to the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis. A deletion of the secA2 gene in M. tuberculosis attenuates the virulence of the organism in mice. By comparing the profile of proteins secreted by wild-type M. tuberculosis and the  \\(\\Delta\\) secA2 mutant, we identified superoxide dismutase A (SodA) as a protein dependent on SecA2 for secretion. SodA lacks a classical signal sequence for protein export. Our data suggests that SecA2-dependent export is a new type of secretion pathway that is part of a virulence mechanism of M. tuberculosis to elude the oxidative attack of macrophages.\n\nAccepted 16 December, 2002. *For co\n\n--- Last 2000 characters ---\nom BioResources) and eluted with an increasing acetonitrile gradient using a MicroPro capillary HPLC system (Eldex Laboratories).

MS/MS data of the peptides were matched to M. tuberculosis proteins using the SEQUEST software (Eng et al., 1994; Yates et al., 1995). The SEQUEST software was set to consider the oxidation of methionine (+16.0) and the acrylamide modification of cysteine (+71.0).\n\n### Immunoblot analysis\n\nCulture filtrate proteins (CFP) and whole cell lysates (WCL) were subject to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane.
