Let me start by creating a plan and then analyzing the PDF file to extract the protein-nucleic acid binding data.

**Plan:**
1. [ ] Check if the PDF file exists and read its content using pdfplumber
2. [ ] Analyze the PDF content to identify protein-nucleic acid binding data
3. [ ] Extract UniProt ID, protein mutations, nucleic acid information, PDB ID, method, dG, and Kd values
4. [ ] Format the data into the required CSV structure
5. [ ] Save the results to the specified path

Let me start by reading the PDF file:

output_csv = "/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/kimi-k2.5/pronab_extract.csv"

# Create output directories if they don't exist
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(output_csv), exist_ok=True)

# Check if PDF exists
print(f"PDF exists: {os.path.exists(pdf_path)}")

Binding Studies with Mutants of Zif268
CONTRIBUTION OF INDIVIDUAL SIDE CHAINS TO BINDING AFFINITY AND SPECIFICITY IN THE Zif268
ZINC FINGER-DNA COMPLEX*
(Received for publication, January 6, 1999, and in revised form, March 22, 1999)

The Zif268 zinc finger-DNA complex has served as a
model system for understanding how Cys2His2type zinc
fingers recognize DNA. Structural studies of the Zif268-
DNA complex revealed that residues at four positions inthe
ahelix of each zinc finger play key roles in recogni-
tion, but there has been no information about the pre-cise contributions of individual residues. Here we re-port the results of binding studies involving fivemutants of Zif268 that have changes in the base-contact-ing residues of finger one. These studies let us evaluatethe contributions that Arg
18(position 21o ft h e ahelix),
Asp20(position 2), Glu21(position 3), and Arg24(position
6) make to the overall energy of DNA binding. Our re-sults confirm the important role played by these argin-ines. By comparing the affinities of the wild type andmutant peptides for various sites, we also prove thatAsp
20and Glu21play important roles in determining
binding site specificity.
Zinc fingers of the Cys2His2class are one of the most abun-
dant DNA-binding motifs found in eukaryotes (1, 2). These zinc
finger proteins recognize a diverse set of DNA sequences, anddesign and selection efforts have produced many variant fin-gers with modified specificities ( e.g.Refs. 3–10). The first zinc
finger-DNA complex to be visualized at atomic resolution in-volved the three fingers of Zif268 (11). This structure of theZif268-DNA complex, since refined to 1.6 Å (12), revealed thatthe complex has a relatively simple, modular arrangement(Fig. 1a). Each finger contains a short, two-stranded antipar-allel
bsheet and an ahelix. The sheet and the helix are held
together by a small hydrophobic core and by a zinc ion, whichis coordinated by two conserved cysteines from the sheet regionand two conserved histidines from the
ahelix. Each of the three
Zif268 fingers has a similar docking arrangement with respectto the DNA, and each uses residues from the amino-terminalportion of its
ahelix to contact bases in the major groove. The
majority of the base contacts involve the guanine-rich strand ofthe binding site, and each finger makes its primary contactswith a three base pair subsite (GCG/TGG/GCG).
In the Zif268 complex, amino acid residues at four positions
of the
ahelix make direct base contacts (positions 21, 2, 3, and
6, numbering with respect to the start of the helix). Thesecontacts are summarized below and in Fig. 1 b. (For a detaileddescription of the Zif268-DNA interface, the reader is referred
to the original papers describing the structure (11, 12).) Theresidue at position 21o ft h e
ahelix is an arginine in all three
fingers (Arg18, Arg46, and Arg74), and, in each case, this argi-
nine makes a pair of hydrogen bonds with the guanine at the 3 9
end of the finger’s subsite. Each of the fingers also has anaspartic acid at position 2 of the
ahelix (Asp20, Asp48, and
Asp76), and in each finger this aspartic acid residue makes a
pair of hydrogen bonds with the arginine from position 21.
This interaction presumably helps orient the arginine and
could thus increase the specificity of the arginine-guanine in-teraction. The aspartic acid from position 2 may also interactwith a base on the opposite strand of the DNA that is justoutside the primary 3-base pair subsite of the finger. (Note thatalthough we describe the binding site in terms of 3-base pairsubsites in this paper, one could also describe recognition withrespect to overlapping 4-base pair subsites.) In all three fin-gers, the residue at position 3 of the
ahelix contacts the middle
base of the finger’s 3-base pair subsite, but these contacts aredifferent in different fingers. In finger two, the residue atposition 3 is a histidine. This histidine forms a hydrogen bondwith guanine 6 and makes van der Waals’ contacts with thy-mine 5. Fingers one and three have a glutamic acid at position3 of the helix. These glutamic acids do not make any hydrogenbonds with the bases, but the 1.6 Å structure revealed that theydo make van der Waals’ contacts; the C
gand C dfrom each of
these glutamic acids are in van der Waals’ contact with the C5and C6 of the cytosine from the middle base pair of the finger’ssubsite. Fingers one and three have an arginine at position 6 ofthe
ahelix. In both of these fingers, this arginine makes a pair
of hydrogen bonds with the guanine at the 5 9end of the finger’s
subsite. (Finger two has a threonine at the corresponding po-sition, but this residue does not make any direct base contacts.)

The Zif268 zinc finger-DNA complex has served as a
model system for understanding how Cys2His2type zinc
fingers recognize DNA. Structural studies of the Zif268-
DNA complex revealed that residues at four positions inthe
ahelix of each zinc finger play key roles in recogni-

20and Glu21play important roles in determining
binding site specificity.
Zinc fingers of the Cys2His2class are one of the most abun-
dant DNA-binding motifs found in eukaryotes (1, 2). These zinc
finger proteins recognize a diverse set of DNA sequences, anddesign and selection efforts have produced many variant fin-gers with modified specificities ( e.g.Refs. 3–10). The first zinc

This structure of theZif268-DNA complex, since refined to 1.6 Å (12), revealed thatthe complex has a relatively simple, modular arrangement(Fig. 1a). Each finger contains a short, two-stranded antipar-allel
bsheet and an ahelix. The sheet and the helix are held
together by a small hydrophobic core and by a zinc ion, whichis coordinated by two conserved cysteines from the sheet regionand two conserved histidines from the

Zif268 fingers has a similar docking arrangement with respectto the DNA, and each uses residues from the amino-terminalportion of its
ahelix to contact bases in the major groove. The
majority of the base contacts involve the guanine-rich strand ofthe binding site, and each finger makes its primary contactswith a three base pair subsite (GCG/TGG/GCG).
In the Zif268 complex, amino acid residues at four positions
of the
ahelix make direct base contacts (positions 21, 2, 3, and
6, numbering with respect to the start of the helix). Thesecontacts are summarized below and in Fig. 1 b. (For a detaileddescription of the Zif268-DNA interface, the reader is referred
to the original papers describing the structure (11, 12).) Theresidue at position 21o ft h e
ahelix is an arginine in all three
fingers (Arg18, Arg46, and Arg74), and, in each case, this argi-
nine makes a pair of hydrogen bonds with the guanine at the 3 9
end of the finger’s subsite. Each of the fingers also has anaspartic acid at position 2 of the

This interaction presumably helps orient the arginine and
could thus increase the specificity of the arginine-guanine in-teraction. The aspartic acid from position 2 may also interactwith a base on the opposite strand of the DNA that is justoutside the primary 3-base pair subsite of the finger. (Note thatalthough we describe the binding site in terms of 3-base pairsubsites in this paper, one could also describe recognition withrespect to overlapping 4-base pair subsites.) In all three fin-gers, the residue at position 3 of the
ahelix contacts the middle
base of the finger’s 3-base pair subsite, but these contacts aredifferent in different fingers. In finger two, the residue atposition 3 is a histidine. This histidine forms a hydrogen bondwith guanine 6 and makes van der Waals’ contacts with thy-mine 5. Fingers one and three have a glutamic acid at position3 of the helix. These glutamic acids do not make any hydrogenbonds with the bases, but the 1.6 Å structure revealed that theydo make van der Waals’ contacts; the C
gand C dfrom each of
these glutamic acids are in van der Waals’ contact with the C5and C6 of the cytosine from the middle base pair of the finger’ssubsite. Fingers one and three have an arginine at position 6 ofthe
ahelix. In both of these fingers, this arginine makes a pair
of hydrogen bonds with the guanine at the 5 9end of the finger’s
subsite. (Finger two has a threonine at the corresponding po-sition, but this residue does not make any direct base contacts.)
Numerous modeling, design, and selection studies (3, 6, 7, 9,
13–16) confirm that the residues at positions 21, 2, 3, and 6 of
the
ahelix in each finger play important roles in site-specific
recognition. However, the precise contribution that individualresidues make to binding affinity and specificity in the Zif268-DNA complex has not been known. Although a few mutantswith changes in the base-contacting residues have been con-structed, the subsequent binding studies used peptides ex-pressed on the surface of phage (17, 18), and we believe thatmeasurements with purified peptides will ultimately be moreaccurate. To carefully study the roles of individual residues, wehave constructed five mutants with alterations in the base-contacting residues of finger one. Here we report the equilib-rium dissociation constants of these peptides at a wild type siteand two mutant binding sites, and we use these data to analyzethe role that each of these residues plays in site-specificrecognition.

Protein Expression and Purification—Mutations were introduced
into pZif89 (the expression construct that encodes the three fingers of
Zif268 (11)) via the four primer polymerase chain reaction method (19).The resulting polymerase chain reaction product, which included theentire zinc finger coding region, was gel purified (Qiagen), digested withNdeI and BamHI, and ligated into NdeI-BamHI-digested pET3a (R18A,
D20A, R18A/D20A, and R24A) or pET21a (E21A). The sequences of allfive mutant genes were verified by dideoxy sequencing (performed bythe Biopolymers Laboratory, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Mas-sachusetts Institute of Technology). The expression constructs weretransformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells containing either the
pLysE plasmid (wild type Zif268, R18A, D20A, R18A/D20A, and R24A)or the pLysS plasmid (E21A), and expression was induced as recom-mended (Novagen). The peptides (Fig. 2 a) were purified by reversed-
phase batch extraction on Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters) and re-versed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography on a C4 column(Vydac) essentially as described (11). Purified peptides were folded inan anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products) by dissolving them inwater and then adding ZnSO
4to 2.75 m Mand bis-tris-propane, pH 6.8,
to 50 m M(3). The folded peptides were stored in aliquots at 280 °C. The
peptides were about 95% pure (E21A and R24A) or 98% pure (wild type,R18A, D20A, and R18A/D20A), as estimated from examination of silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels.

Binding Studies with Mutants of Zif268
CONTRIBUTION OF INDIVIDUAL SIDE CHAINS TO BINDING AFFINITY AND SPECIFICITY IN THE Zif268

The Zif268 zinc finger-DNA complex has served as a
model system for understanding how Cys2His2type zinc
fingers recognize DNA. Structural studies of the Zif268-
DNA complex revealed that residues at four positions inthe

13–16) confirm that the residues at positions 21, 2, 3, and 6 of
the
ahelix in each finger play important roles in site-specific
recognition. However, the precise contribution that individualresidues make to binding affinity and specificity in the Zif268-DNA complex has not been known. Although a few mutantswith changes in the base-contacting residues have been con-structed, the subsequent binding studies used peptides ex-pressed on the surface of phage (17, 18), and we believe thatmeasurements with purified peptides will ultimately be moreaccurate. To carefully study the roles of individual residues, wehave constructed five mutants with alterations in the base-contacting residues of finger one. Here we report the equilib-rium dissociation constants of these peptides at a wild type siteand two mutant binding sites, and we use these data to analyzethe role that each of these residues plays in site-specificrecognition.

RESULTS
We have constructed mutants of Zif268 in which each of the
base-contacting residues in finger one, Arg18, Asp20, Glu21, and
Arg24, has been individually mutated to alanine. Because the
side chains of Arg18and Asp20interact with each other, we also
have constructed an R18A/D20A double mutant. Each of these
mutant peptides has been overexpressed and purified, and itsaffinity for a Zif268 binding site has been determined by a gelmobility shift assay. Altered binding sites also have been testedwith wild type Zif268 and with some of the mutant peptides.

Although a few mutantswith changes in the base-contacting residues have been con-structed, the subsequent binding studies used peptides ex-pressed on the surface of phage (17, 18), and we believe thatmeasurements with purified peptides will ultimately be moreaccurate. To carefully study the roles of individual residues, wehave constructed five mutants with alterations in the base-contacting residues of finger one. Here we report the equilib-rium dissociation constants of these peptides at a wild type siteand two mutant binding sites, and we use these data to analyzethe role that each of these residues plays in site-specificrecognition.

    binds the GCC site with a Kdof 2.4 n M, only 24-fold less tightly
    than it binds the wild type site (Fig. 3 b). Thus, the Asp203Ala
    mutation results in significantly reduced specificity at basepair 10. As expected, the R18A/D20A double mutant has lostalmost all specificity at base pair 10; the R18A/D20A peptidebinds the GCC site with a K
    dof 5.1 n M, almost as well as it
    binds the wild type site (Fig. 3 c).
    Glu21(position 3) and Specificity at Base Pair 9—Glu21,
    which in the crystal structure of the Zif268 complex makes vander Waals’ contacts with cytosine 9 (12), does not appear tomake a significant contribution to binding affinity. (The E21Amutant has only a slightly lower K

Line 186: type Zif268 displays a clear preference for a wild type GCGsubsite: Zif268 binds the GAG site with a K
    dthan does the wild type
    protein.) To determine whether this residue nonetheless playssome role in determining binding specificity, we examinedbinding of the wild type and E21A peptides to a site in whichcytosine 9 was changed to adenine (the GAG site; Fig. 2 b). Wild
    dof 2.2 n M, 13-fold
    less tightly than it binds the wild type binding site (Fig. 4 aand
    Table III). However, mutating Glu21to alanine results in a loss
    of specificity at base pair 9; the E21A mutant peptide displaysno preference for a wild type binding site and actually binds theGAG site slightly more tightly than the wild type site ( K
    dof
    0.10 n M; Fig. 4 b). It appears that Glu21has a greater effect on
    specificity than it has on affinity per se.

# TABLE I - Wild type binding site (GCGTGGGCG)
# The format seems to be: Protein Kd(nM) Ratio dG_change
# Zif268 1.7 (60.07) 3102101
# The "3102101" appears to be a corrupted scientific notation, likely meaning 3x10^-10 = 1 (ratio)

# Looking at the data more carefully:
# Wild type: Kd = 1.7 nM
# The dG values in the table are dG_mut - dG_wild (in kcal/mol)
# So we need to calculate dG_wild from Kd_wild

# From the text: "Wild type Zif268 binds the oligonucleotide site... with a Kd of 1.7 nM"

# R = 1.987 cal/(mol·K), T = 298K (room temperature)
# dG = RT ln(Kd) - but Kd is in M, so 1.7 nM = 1.7 x 10^-9 M
# Actually for binding: dG = RT ln(Kd)

R = 1.987  # cal/(mol·K)
T = 298    # K (room temperature)
RT = R * T / 1000  # kcal/mol

# Calculate dG from Kd

**Key Findings:**
- Three DNA binding sites were tested: wild type (GCGTGGGCG), GCC mutant (GCGTGGGCC), and GAG mutant (GCGTAGGCG)
- Five protein mutants were studied: R18A, D20A, R18A/D20A (double mutant), E21A, and R24A
- dG values were calculated using the formula: dG = RT × ln(Kd), where R = 1.987 cal/(mol·K) and T = 298K
