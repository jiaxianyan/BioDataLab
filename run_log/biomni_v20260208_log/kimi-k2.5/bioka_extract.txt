## ABSTRACT

Clinical evidence shows that following initial response to treatment, drug-resistant cancer cells frequently evolve and, eventually, most tumors become resistant to all available therapies. We compiled a focused library consisting of  \(>500\)  commercially available or newly synthesized 8-hydroxyquinoline (8OHQ) derivatives whose toxicity is paradoxically increased rather than decreased by the activity of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a transporter conferring multidrug resistance (MDR). Here, we deciphered the mechanism of action of NSC297366 that shows exceptionally strong Pgp-potentiated toxicity. Treatment of cells with NSC297366 resulted in changes associated with the activity of potent anticancer iron chelators.

## Introduction

Clinical evidence shows that, following initial response to treatment, drug-resistant cancer cells frequently evolve, and eventually most tumors become resistant to all available therapies (1). Cancer cells can escape treatment by various mechanisms. The most straightforward cause of therapy resistance is linked to cellular alterations that prevent drugs to act on their target. For example, therapies hitting cancer-specific pathways are often blunted by mutations altering the target or by the activation of compensatory pathways. Alternatively, cell-intrinsic resistance mechanisms can change the "cellular pharmacology" of the cancer cell, influencing the uptake, metabolism or the

Strikingly, iron depletion was more pronounced in MDR cells due to the Pgp-mediated efflux of NSC297366-iron complexes. Our results indicate that iron homeostasis can be targeted by MDR-selective compounds for the selective elimination of multidrug resistant cancer cells, setting the stage for a therapeutic approach to fight transporter-mediated drug resistance.

Significance: Modulation of the MDR phenotype has the potential to increase the efficacy of anticancer therapies. These findings show that the MDR transporter is a "double-edged sword" that can be turned against resistant cancer.

efflux of the drugs to reduce their concentrations below a cell-killing threshold (1, 2). Upregulation of cell membrane efflux transporters of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily leads to simultaneous resistance against structurally and functionally unrelated chemotherapeutic agents. In particular, P-glycoprotein (Pgp, MDR1), the product of ABCB1 gene, was shown to be expressed in several drug resistant malignancies, including ovarian carcinoma (3), acute myeloid leukemia (4), chronic myeloid leukemia (5), small cell lung cancer (6), and more (1, 2).

On the basis of the correlation of P-glycoprotein expression and function (7) with unfavorable treatment response, it is universally accepted that pharmacologic modulation of the multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype has the potential to significantly increase the efficacy of currently available anticancer therapies.

s conducted with Pgp inhibitors did not fulfill this expectation, failing to confirm clinical benefit (8). Failure of the trials led to a setback in research, and the shutdown of the pharmaceutical development of transporter inhibitors for the improvement of anticancer therapy. Yet the "transporter problem" has not vanished, as evidenced by new studies supporting the relevance and benefit of research on the role of ABC transporters in clinical drug resistance (2). For example, studies conducted with genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) mirroring many aspects of the human disease have shown that acquired resistance to docetaxel, doxorubicin, topotecan or olaparib is caused by the increased expression of the Abcb1 or Abcg2 genes, and the contribution of drug efflux to drug resistance was also confirmed in ABC transporter-deficient tumors (9).

Failure of the inhibitors has boosted research in other directions, exploring the possibility to evade efflux, or to exploit the paradoxical sensitivity associated with efflux-based drug resistance mechanisms (1). Alterations that confer selective advantage during the evolution of cancer cells might also create vulnerabilities that can be exploited therapeutically (10, 11). From this perspective, resistance can be interpreted as a trait that could be targeted by new drugs. In recent

Cserepes et al.

years we have undertaken a systematic effort to identify "MDR-selective" compounds exhibiting increased, rather than decreased toxicity against MDR cells. Our method, based on the correlation of toxicity profiles with Pgp expression patterns in the NCI60 cell panel, has led to the discovery of several compounds with robust, Pgp dependent toxic activity across diverse cell lines (12-15).

To date, the mechanism of Pgp potentiated toxicity of the MDR-selective compounds is not known, limiting intelligent drug design. Strikingly, MDR-selective compounds show structural coherence, highlighting chemical features that may be responsible for a common mechanism of action. In particular, there is a significant enrichment of metal chelators, indicating that metal-ion interaction could be key to the cytotoxicity of MDR-selective compounds (16, 17).

Here, we describe the relation of iron chelation to the MDR-selective toxicity of NSC297366, a compound containing an 8-hydroxyquinoline substructure possessing exceptionally strong Pgp-potentiated toxicity. We show that the toxicity of NSC297366 is linked to cellular iron depletion, which is exacerbated by Pgp.

## Materials and Methods

### Cell cultures

MES-SA, MES-SA/DX5 cells were obtained from ATCC where they were characterized by DNA fingerprinting. The ABCB1-overexpressing subline MES-SA/B1 was produced by lentiviral transduction of pRRL-EF1-ABCB1. MES-SA mCherry and MES-SA/B1 mOrange cell lines were engineered to overexpress the fluorescent protein with lentiviral transduction of pRRL-EF1 plasmids. P-glycoprotein function was characterized by the Calcein AM assay (Supplementary Fig. S2; ref. 7). Cells were periodically tested and resulted negative for Mycoplasma contamination with the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza). Cells were cultured for not more than 30 passages or 3 months after thawing. Cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with  \(10\%\)  fetal bovine serum (Gibco),  \(5\mathrm{mmol / L}\)  L-glutamine (Gibco), and  \(50~\mathrm{U / mL}\)  penicillin/streptomycin solution (Life Technologies).

### Chemicals

Doxorubicin was purchased from TEVA. NSC297366 was obtained from DTP's drug repository (NCI, NIH). Tariquidar was a kind gift from Susan Bates (NCI, NIH, Bethesda, MD). Verapamil, iron chloride, deferiprone, cobalt chloride, human holotransferrin and deferasirox were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Iron chloride, cobalt chloride and transferrin were used in aqueous solutions, all other chemicals were dissolved in DMSO.

### Cell viability assays

MTT assay was used to quantify cell viability, as described previously (14). For the drug combination tests, 384-well tissue culture plates were used. In each well, 2,500 cells were seeded in 20  \(\mu\) L medium, 1 day prior to the addition of the 2 compounds to be combined in additional  \(20 + 20~\mu \mathrm{L}\)  volumes. Fully automated pipetting steps were performed by a Hamilton StarLet liquid handling workstation. Plates were incubated for 6 days. Growth inhibition (GI) of MES-SA mCherry and MES-SA/B1 mOrange lines was assessed based on the detection of the respective fluorescent intensities scanned from the wells (585ex/610em for mCherry and 545ex/567em for mOrange). Data were normalized to negative (live cells, maximal fluorescence) and positive (dead cells, minimal fluorescence) controls.  \(\mathrm{GI}_{50}\)  values of "compound A" with the fixed

concentrations of "compound B" (and vice versa) were paired, and plotted on an equipotent graph as  \(\mathrm{GI}_{50}\)  isoboles. For each data point of the isobole, significance was calculated as the combination index (CI; ref. 18). Drug combinations were considered additive at  \(0.85 \leq \mathrm{CI} \leq 1.2\) ; moderate and strong synergism was defined as  \(\mathrm{CI} < 0.85\)  and  \(\mathrm{CI} < 0.7\) , respectively; moderate and strong antagonism was defined as  \(\mathrm{CI} > 1.2\)  and  \(\mathrm{CI} > 1.45\) , respectively.

### RNA isolation and RT-PCR

Cells grown in 6-well plates were homogenized in  \(1\mathrm{ml}\)  TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at  \(80\%\)  confluency. Total RNA was isolated from cell lysates using Direct-zol MiniPrep Kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. cDNA samples were prepared from  \(1,000~\mathrm{ng}\)  total RNA using the AMV Reverse Transcription System Kit (Promega). TaqMan probes for ABCB1, RPLP0, TFRC, NDRG1 and VEGFA were ordered from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Real-time PCR analyses were carried out using the StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific); mRNA fold changes were determined by the  \(2^{-\Delta \Delta C_{t}}\)  method. Gene expression levels were normalized to RPLP0 (60S acidic ribosomal protein P0) expression.

### Western blot analysis

Cells were lysed with MLB (No. 20-168, Merck KGaA) cell lysis solution containing  \(10~\mu \mathrm{g / mL}\)  aprotinin and  \(10~\mu \mathrm{g / mL}\)  leupeptin. Following SDS-PAGE and blotting, HIF1 \(\alpha\)  was detected using anti-HIF1 \(\alpha\)  Rabbit polyclonal antibody (ab51608, Abcam UK) in 1:500 dilution. Cell cycle-related protein levels were revealed using the cell-cycle regulation sampler kits (#9932 & #9870, Cell Signaling Technology Inc.). Anti-p53 antibody (#2524, Cell Signaling Technology) was used in 1:500 dilution. Anti- \(\beta\) -actin (clone AC-15, Sigma) was used to reveal endogenous control protein levels. Signals were detected using the HRP-conjugated goat antimouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Immunoblots were revealed by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Advanta Inc.).

### Flow cytometry

After treatment, cells were trypsinized, resuspended in DMEM, and distributed to  \(5\mathrm{ml}\)  sample tubes  \((3\times 10^{5}\)  cells). Before labeling, the cells were washed in  \(1\mathrm{ml}\)  washing solution  \((0.5\%)\)  BSA in PBS), to be resuspended in  \(50~\mu \mathrm{L}\)  of BSA-PBS. For cell-cycle measurement, we followed the two-dimensional cell-cycle analysis protocol (19), labeling the cells with propidium iodide (PI) and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, Sigma), the latter further labeled by anti-BrdU (clone B44, BD Biosciences) and anti-mouse IgG-Alexa488-conjugated antibody (Life Technologies). Apoptosis was measured by Annexin V and PI staining, using the Annexin V, FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Dojindo Molecular Technologies). Samples were analyzed with an Attune NxT flow cytometer (Life Technologies).

### Determination of cellular dNTP levels

Cultured cells were treated with DMSO, hydroxyurea  \((2\mathrm{mmol / L})\)  or NSC297366  \((4\mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L})\)  for 24 hours. Cells were rinsed with PBS to remove residual media. dNTPs were extracted based on ref. 20, with a few modifications. Briefly, adherent cells were detached by trypsin, resuspended gently in  \(10\mathrm{mL}\)  of ice-cold PBS, and an  \(500\mu \mathrm{L}\)  aliquot was removed to determine the cell number using a hemocytometer. Samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at  \(3,000\times g\)  at  \(4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) , cell pellets were resuspended in  \(500~\mu \mathrm{L}\)  of ice-cold

\(60\%\)  methanol, placed at  \(95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\)  for 3 minutes. The extracts were centrifuged  \((16,000\times g\)  for 5 minutes at  \(4^{\circ}\mathrm{C})\) , and the supernatant was transferred into a new tube and evaporated under centrifugal vacuum at  \(45^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) . The resultant pellet was resuspended in  \(50\mu l\)  nuclease-free water ready to assay or stored at  \(-20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\)  until use. The dNTP pool was determined using the fluorescence polymerase-based assay developed by Wilson and colleagues (20), with modifications as detailed in the Supplementary Material.

### ATPase assay

ATPase activity of crude membranes isolated from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells expressing human P-glycoprotein was measured by colorimetric detection of inorganic phosphate liberation as described in (21). Preformed iron complexes of NSC297366 or 8-hydroxyquinoline were prepared by mixing the ligand with 0.5 equivalents of iron.

### Total-reflection X-ray fluorescence measurements

MES-SA and MES-SA/B1 cells were pretreated with  \(25\mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}\)  holotransferrin in serum-free medium for 4 hours  \((37^{\circ}\mathrm{C})\)  to fill intracel</observation>

umulation experiments, cells were treated for 4 hours with  \(5\mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}\)  of the iron-chelator complexes. Intracellular iron content was determined by total-reflection X-ray fluorescence (TXRF) as described in ref. 22. Briefly, cell pellets were digested for 24 hours at room temperature in a solution containing  \(20~\mu \mathrm{L}\) \(30\%\) \(\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2\) ,  \(80~\mu \mathrm{L}\) \(65\%\) \(\mathrm{HNO}_3\) , and  \(10~\mu \mathrm{L}\)  of  \(15~\mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{mL}\)  Ga (Merck; added as an internal standard). Two microliters of the resulting solutions was pipetted on the quartz reflectors of an Atomika 8030C TXRF spectrometer (Atomika Instruments GmbH). The K  \(\alpha\)  line used for determination of Fe was set to  \(6.403\mathrm{keV}\) .

### Mass spectrometry

A total of  \(10^{6}\)  cells were seeded in 6-well plates. After 4h treatment with  \(5\mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}\) \(\mathrm{FeCl}_3\)  NSC297366 complex at  \(37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) , cells were precipitated in  \(50~\mu \mathrm{L}\)  acetonitrile (Sigma). Following centrifugation, supernatants were analyzed on an AB Sciex 3200QTrap hybrid tandem mass spectrometer coupled to a PerkinElmer series 200 HPLC system. NSC297366 levels were quantified in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode using phenylalanine as an internal standard (see Supplementary Material for more details).

## Statistical analysis

\(\mathrm{IC}_{50}\)  values were calculated from normalized dose-response curves using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software). Student (two-sided)  \(t\)  test was used to evaluate statistical significance  \((^{*}, P < 0.05;^{**}, P < 0.01;^{***}, P < 0.001)\) . Deviation from the additive isobole was determined by the CI, described in ref. 18. All data represent at least 3 independent experiments.

### Results

### Screening of a focused 8-hydroxyquinoline library identifies MDR-selective derivatives whose toxicity is potentiated by P-glycoprotein

Previously, we identified several 8-hydroxyquinoline (8OHQ) derivatives as MDR-selective compounds targeting the collateral sensitivity of Pgp-expressing MDR cancer cells (14, 15). To increase the scope of structurally related MDR-selective com

pounds, we compiled a focused library consisting of  \(>500\)  commercially available or newly synthesized 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives and screened the compounds using the parental MES-SA and the multidrug resistant MES-SA/DX5 cell lines. This screening effort has confirmed the relevance of the 8-hydroxyquinoline backbone in MDR-selective toxicity, and the requirement of functional Pgp to mediate sensitization of MDR cells (Fig. 1A). NSC297366, in which the 8OHQ substructure is embedded into a ring is one of the highly active derivatives, and thus was chosen to characterize the mechanism of action of MDR-selective toxicity (results obtained with 4 additional MDR-selective 8OHQ derivatives are shown in Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). To explore the specific contribution and the functional relevance of P-glycoprotein in collateral sensitivity to NSC297366, we generated MES-SA/B1 cells by lentiviral transduction of MES-SA cells with an expression vector encoding human MDR1 cDNA. Using this isogenic cell line pair, we confirmed that the moderate expression of P-glycoprotein in MES-SA/B1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A-S2C) is sufficient to confer resistance to doxorubicin as well as increased sensitivity to NSC297366 (Fig. 1B). Both phenotypes were fully reversed by the specific Pgp inhibitor tariquidar, showing the reliance of collateral sensitivity on P-glycoprotein function. Notably, MDR-selective toxicity was not restricted to MES-SA/B1 cells. NSC297366 proved to preferentially target several further MDR cell lines with variable Pgp expression and different tissue of origin (Supplementary Table S2), whereas overexpression of ABCG2 did not sensitize cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A-S3B). To expand the scope of the in vitro models to cells expressing low Pgp levels, NSC297366 was assayed in sorted MES-SA/B1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4), an independent MES-SA/B1 cell line transfected with lower viral titers (MES-SA/B1 M50) and the KB epidermoid carcinoma series selected from KB-3-1 cells in increasing concentrations of colchicine (KB-8, KB-8-5, KB-8-5-11; ref. 23). These results confirmed that paradoxical hypersensitivity of MDR cells is proportional to Pgp levels, pertaining to cells expressing clinically relevant levels of Pgp (Supplementary Fig. S5). Selectivity was abrogated by functional inhibition of Pgp, indicating that Pgp is both necessary and sufficient to convey sensitivity to this compound.

### Modulation of cellular iron levels influences selective toxicity of NSC297366

Our recent work indicates that MDR-selective 8-hydroxyquinolines are capable of binding iron(III) and copper(II) ions (24). To test the role of iron in the toxicity of NSC297366, we repeated the cytotoxicity experiments in the presence of established iron chelators or excess iron  \(\mathrm{(FeCl_3)}\) . Excess iron attenuated the toxicity of NSC297366. Strikingly, the protective effect of excess iron was more pronounced in MES-SA/B1 cells (Fig. 2A), leading to a significant reduction of selective toxicity in the presence of higher  \(\mathrm{FeCl}_3\)  concentrations (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Table S1). Conversely, MES-SA/B1 cells proved to be more sensitive to the combined effect of NSC297366 and the established iron chelator deferiprone. Whereas the combination of NSC297366 and deferiprone resulted in pronounced synergistic toxicity in MES-SA/B1 cells, the same two compounds were only additive in MES-SA cells or in MES-SA/B1 cells treated with tariquidar (Fig. 2C and D). Taken together, these results demonstrated that the MDR-selective toxicity of NSC297366 is linked to intracellular iron levels and suggested that P-glycoprotein expressing cells may be particularly prone to iron depletion caused by this compound.

Pgp-potentiated cytotoxicity of the 8OHQ derivatives in multidrug resistant cancer cell lines. A, Data points represent average  \(\mathsf{pIC}_{50}\)  values of 8OHQ derivatives against Pgp-negative MES-SA (x-axis) and Pgp expressing MES-SA/DX5 (y-axis) cells in absence (purple; 471 compounds) or presence (green; 252 compounds) of  \(1\mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}\)  tariquidar. Compounds displaying at least a twofold difference in toxicity are either MDR-selective (above the top dashed line) or Pgp substrates (below the bottom dashed line). The compounds represent a focused library built around the 8OHQ scaffold, containing many inactive compounds (scattered around the axis representing equal toxicity), such as the parental compound 8OHQ (blue). Whereas MES-SA/DX5 cells are resistant to doxorubicin (red), they are hypersensitive against several 8OHQ derivatives, including NSC297366 (pink). The contribution of P-glycoprotein to drug resistance or collateral sensitivity is abolished in the presence of tariquidar (green data points). Dashed and straight lines point to  \(\mathsf{pIC}_{50}\)  values measured in absence or the presence of tariquidar, respectively. Error bars, SD of at least three independent experiments. B, P-glycoprotein is a double-edged sword. As compared to parental MES-SA cells (green), Pgp expression in MES-SA/DX5 (red) or MES-SA/B1 (orange) cells confers resistance to doxorubicin (left), but also sensitivity to NSC297366 (right); both are abrogated by the specific Pgp inhibitor tariquidar (dashed lines).

### P-glycoprotein increases the NSC297366-mediated induction of TfR mRNA levels and the stabilization of HIF1 \(\alpha\)

In iron-starved cells, upregulation of TfR1 levels ensure increased acquisition of iron through the receptor-mediated endocytosis of the transferrin-iron complex. In the next set of experiments, we evaluated the effect of NSC297366 on transferrin receptor (TfR1) mRNA levels in MES-SA and MES-SA/B1 cells. Despite similar steady state TfR1 levels, induction of TfR1 mRNA expression by  \(1\mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}\)  NSC297366 was exclusively observed in MES-SA/B1 cells (Fig. 3A). The Pglycoprotein inhibitor tariquidar had no effect on baseline TfR1 levels but prevented TfR1 induction by NSC293766 in MES-SA/B1 cells. Whereas excess iron downregulated TfR1 levels in both cells, exogenous iron was no longer able to downregulate TfR1 levels in MES-SA/B1 cells in the presence of NSC297366. Again, this difference was not observed when the transporter was inhibited by tariquidar (Fig. 3B). Thus, in line with data presented in Fig. 2, these results confirm that cellular iron depletion induced by NSC297366 is exacerbated by P-glycoprotein. A decrease of the labile iron pool results in impaired prolyl hydroxylase domain enzyme (PHD) activity, thereby inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 \(\alpha\)  hydroxylation and proteasomal degradation (25). Treatment with NSC297366 or cobalt chloride (which inhibits PHD activity through a different mechanism; ref. 26)

increased HIF1 \(\alpha\)  protein levels (Fig. 3C), while  \(HIF1\alpha\)  mRNA expression remained unchanged (Supplementary Fig. S6A). However, the NSC297366-induced increase of HIF1 \(\alpha\)  levels was detected at much lower NSC297366 concentrations in MES-SA/B1 cells as compared to the parental cell line. Again, differential sensitivity of the cells was abrogated by excess iron or the Pgp inhibitor</observation>

apoptosis, proving that the MDR-selective toxicity of NSC297366 is linked to the efflux activity of P-glycoprotein.

### P-glycoprotein depletes cellular iron below critical levels by effluxing the NSC297366-iron complex from the cells

Finally, to directly test if selective toxicity of NSC297366 is indeed linked to excess iron depletion, intracellular iron levels were followed by TXRF (22). Resting iron levels were not different, and loading with transferrin-bound iron resulted in a comparable increase of iron levels in both cell lines (Fig. 6A). Following incubation at  \(37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) , cellular iron levels showed a gradual decrease indicative of the activation of regulatory mechanisms restoring iron levels after loading with holotransferrin (29). The presence of 8OHQ did not influence this pattern, and treatment with NSC297366 also did not change the kinetics of iron release in MES-SA cells during the time course (12 hours) of the experiment. In sharp contrast, NSC297366 induced a significant reduction of iron levels in MES-SA/B1 cells, essentially depleting P-glycoprotein expressing cells of iron. Pgp mediated depletion of iron levels was confirmed in the KB cell series (Supplementary Fig. S12A). In both models, NSC297366-induced depletion of iron levels could be prevented by tariqidar, suggesting that the selective reduction of iron levels is due to the P-glycoprotein-dependent efflux of the NSC297366-iron complex. To verify this proposition, we evaluated the cellular accumulation of preformed iron complexes. Following incubation with NSC297366 in the presence of iron, cellular iron levels increased significantly in MES-SA and KB-3-1 cells, indicating that iron was shuttled into the cells by in situ formed complexes. In sharp contrast, iron uptake of MES-SA/B1 and the MDR KB cells was only incremental (Fig 6B; Supplementary Fig. S12B; further MDR-selective 8OHQ derivatives are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1). In parallel, intracellular levels of NSC297366 were significantly lower in MES-SA/ B1 cells unless Pgp-mediated efflux was inhibited by tariqidar, which

restored both iron and NSC297366 levels to that observed in MES-SA cells (Fig. 6B). Collectively, these data indicate that MDR cells accumulate less iron and NSC297366 because Pgp expels iron chelates from the cells. Finally, the role of Pgp in the transport of preformed iron complexes was verified by ATPase activity measurements (21). As shown in Fig. 6C, the iron complex of NSC297366 significantly stimulated the Pgp ATPase, whereas the iron complex of 8OHQ did not have any effect. These results indicate that the iron complex of NSC297366 is a P-glycoprotein substrate, providing an explanation of the selective iron depletion and the ensuing elimination of NSC297366-treated MES-SA/B1 cells.

## Discussion

There exists an unmet medical need for developing targeted and efficient anticancer drugs acting against drug resistant tumors expressing ABCB1/Pgp. Our prior work has identified several compounds whose toxicity is increased, rather than decreased by the activity of P-glycoprotein. We have shown that the function of Pgp is both necessary and sufficient to induce collateral sensitivity in MDR cells. That Pgp is necessary was evidenced by the loss of collateral sensitivity in the presence of specific efflux inhibitors; that Pgp is sufficient was demonstrated by the persistent MDR-selective toxicity of the compounds across diverse MDR cell lines (Supplementary Table S2; Supplementary Fig. S5) (14). However, the mechanism of action of MDR-selective compounds targeting multidrug resistant cells has remained a mystery. The results presented in this study clearly delineate a series of cellular events originating from the Pgp-mediated efflux of iron complexes, leading to the selective depletion of intracellular iron and the eventual elimination of MDR cells.

Several theories have been put forward to explain the paradoxical sensitization effect of Pgp. It has been hypothesized that high affinity

Selective toxicity of NSC297366 is mediated by the inhibition of RNR, resulting in cell-cycle arrest and selective apoptosis in MDR cells. A, NSC297366 induces selective depletion of dATP levels in MES-SA/B1 cells. Cells were treated with  \(4\mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}\)  NSC297366 or 2 mmol/L hydroxyurea for 24 hours. Changes of other dNTPs are shown in Supplementary Fig. S8. Data represent the mean  \(\pm\)  SEM of three experiments. B, Western blot analysis of the effects of NSC297366 on cell-cycle regulatory proteins in MES-SA and MES-SA/B1 cells treated for 24 hours with  \(4\mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}\)  NSC297366 with or without tariquidar (1  \(\mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}\) ). Selective induction of p21, p27, and p53, and a moderate decrease in cyclin D3 and CDK4 levels in MES-SA/B1 cells treated with NSC297366 leads to G1/S arrest, prevented by tariquidar. C, Cell cycle changes after 24 hours of  \(4\mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}\)  NSC297366 treatment (for lower concentrations see Supplementary Fig. S11). Relative percentage of cell-cycle phase distribution was determined by the 2D-cell cycle flow cytometry assay (Supplementary Fig. S10). Treatment with NSC297366 did not have any effect on MES-SA cells, whereas in the case of MES-SA/B1 the ratio of G2 cells was reduced from  \(7,0\%\)  to  \(1,2\%\) , while  \(G_{1}\)  cells increased from  \(44,3\%\)  to  \(53,9\%\) . Selective G1/S arrest in MES-SA/B1 cells was prevented by  \(1\mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}\)  tariquidar. D, Selective induction of apoptosis in MES-SA/B1 cells treated with NSC297366.

## ABSTRACT

Clinical evidence shows that following initial response to treatment, drug-resistant cancer cells frequently evolve and, eventually, most tumors become resistant to all available therapies. We compiled a focused library consisting of  \(>500\)  commercially available or newly synthesized 8-hydroxyquinoline (8OHQ) derivatives whose toxicity is paradoxically increased rather than decreased by the activity of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a transporter conferring multidrug resistance (MDR). Here, we deciphered the mechanism of action of NSC297366 that shows exceptionally strong Pgp-potentiated toxicity. Treatment of cells with NSC297366 resulted in changes associated with the activity of potent anticancer iron chelators.

## Introduction

Clinical evidence shows that, following initial response to treatment, drug-resistant cancer cells frequently evolve, and eventually most tumors become resistant to all available therapies (1). Cancer cells can escape treatment by various mechanisms. The most straightforward cause of therapy resistance is linked to cellular alterations that prevent drugs to act on their target. For example, therapies hitting cancer-specific pathways are often blunted by mutations altering the target or by the activation of compensatory pathways. Alternatively, cell-intrinsic resistance mechanisms can change the "cellular pharmacology" of the cancer cell, influencing the uptake, metabolism or the

Strikingly, iron depletion was more pronounced in MDR cells due to the Pgp-mediated efflux of NSC297366-iron complexes. Our results indicate that iron homeostasis can be targeted by MDR-selective compounds for the selective elimination of multidrug resistant cancer cells, setting the stage for a therapeutic approach to fight transporter-mediated drug resistance.

Significance: Modulation of the MDR phenotype has the potential to increase the efficacy of anticancer therapies. These findings show that the MDR transporter is a "double-edged sword" that can be turned against resistant cancer.

**File saved to:** `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/kimi-k2.5/bioka_extract.csv`

**Rationale:**
- **Pgp/MDR1/ABCB1** (P-glycoprotein): The primary biomarker discussed in the paper. It's used therapeutically to identify and target multidrug resistant cancer cells with selective iron-chelating compounds that exploit Pgp-mediated efflux.
- **TfR1** (Transferrin Receptor 1): Used as a monitoring biomarker for iron starvation status in cells treated with NSC297366.
- **HIF1α** (Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha): Used as a monitoring biomarker for cellular response to iron depletion.
- **VEGFA**: A downstream marker monitored to assess cellular response to iron chelation.
- **p53**: Monitored in the context of cell cycle regulation and apoptosis induced by iron depletion.
- **RNR** (Ribonucleotide reductase): An iron-dependent enzyme that is therapeutically targeted by the iron depletion mechanism.
