Given txt file containing biomarkers and their functions in the file `benchmark/dataset/TheMarker/biomarker.txt`. 

According to the roles of these biomarkers played, labelled the biomarkers as pharmacodynamic biomarker (PDY), safety biomarker (SAF), monitoring biomarker (MOI), predictive biomarker (PRD) and surrogate endpoint (SUR). 

Saving the classification list [label_1, label_2, ...] in the same sort as input file to json file `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/kimi-k2.5/themarker_annotate.json`. 

The output format example is as follows:
["PDY", "SAF", "MOI", "PRD", "SUR"]

All intermediate results should be saved in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/kimi-k2.5/themarker_annotate` directory.

I'll help you classify the biomarkers based on their functions. Let me start by creating a plan and reading the input file.

Plan:
1. [ ] Read the biomarker text file to understand its structure
2. [ ] Create the intermediate results directory
3. [ ] Analyze each biomarker's function and classify them
4. [ ] Save the classification results to the JSON file

Biomarker ID	Biomarker Name	Gene Name	Synonyms	Biomarker Class	Function
B07XCZ	Laminin subunit alpha-3	LAMA3; LAMNA	Laminin subunit alpha 3; Epiligrin 170 kDa subunit; E170; Epiligrin subunit alpha; Kalinin subunit alpha; Laminin-5 subunit alpha; Laminin-6 subunit alpha; Laminin-7 subunit alpha; Nicein subunit alpha	Protein	Binding to cells via a high affinity receptor, laminin is thought to mediate the attachment, migration and organization of cells into tissues during embryonic development by interacting with other extracellular matrix components. Laminin-5 is thought to be involved in cell adhesion via integrin alpha-3/beta-1 in focal adhesion and integrin alpha-6/beta-4 in hemidesmosomes, signal transduction via tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125-FAK and p80, differentiation of keratinocytes.
B36BFV	IL2 mRNA	IL2	Interleukin-2 mRNA; IL-2 mRNA; T-cell growth factor mRNA; TCGF mRNA	mRNA	Cytokine produced by activated CD4-positive helper T-cells and to a lesser extend activated CD8-positive T-cells and natural killer cells that plays pivotal roles in the immune response and tolerance. Binds to a receptor complex composed of either the high-affinity trimeric IL-2R or the low-affinity dimeric IL-2R. Interaction with the receptor leads to oligomerization and conformation changes in the IL-2R subunits resulting in downstream signaling starting with phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3. In turn, JAK1 and JAK3 phosphorylate the receptor to form a docking site leading to the phosphorylation of several substrates including STAT5. This process leads to activation of several pathways including STAT, phosphoinositide-3-kinase/PI3K and mitogen-activated protein kinase/MAPK pathways. Functions as a T-cell growth factor and can increase NK-cell cytolytic activity as well. Promotes strong proliferation of activated B-cells and subsequently immunoglobulin production. Plays a pivotal role in regulating the adaptive immune system by controlling the survival and proliferation of regulatory

B12RGS	Clusterin	CLU; APOJ; CLI; KUB1; AAG4	Ku70-binding protein 1; KUB1; Complement-associated protein SP-40,40; Complement cytolysis inhibitor; CLI; Apolipoprotein J; ApoJ; Apo-J ; Aging-associated gene 4 protein; AAG4	Protein	Functions as extracellular chaperone that prevents aggregation of non native proteins. Prevents stress-induced aggregation of blood plasma proteins. Inhibits formation of amyloid fibrils by APP, APOC2, B2M, CALCA, CSN3, SNCA and aggregation-prone LYZ variants. Does not require ATP. Maintains partially unfolded proteins in a state appropriate for subsequent refolding by other chaperones, such as HSPA8/HSC70. Does not refold proteins by itself. Binding to cell surface receptors triggers internalization of the chaperone-client complex and subsequent lysosomal or proteasomal degradation. Protects cells against apoptosis and against cytolysis by complement. Intracellular forms interact with ubiquitin and SCF E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes and promote the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. Promotes proteasomal degradation of COMMD1 and IKBKB. Modulates NF-kappa-B transcriptional activity. A mitochondrial form suppresses BAX-dependent release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm and inhibit apoptosis. Plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation. An intracellular form suppresses stress-induced apoptosis by stabilizing mitochondrial membrane integrity through interaction with HSPA5. Secreted form does not affect caspase or BAX-mediated intrinsic apoptosis and TNF-induced NF-kappa-B-activity. Secreted form act as an important modulator during neuronal differentiation through interaction with STMN3. Plays a role in the clearance of immune complexes that arise during cell injury. Does not affect caspase or BAX-mediated intrinsic apoptosis and TNF-induced NF-kappa-B-activity. Does not affect caspase or BAX-mediated intrinsic apoptosis and TNF-induced NF-kappa-B-activity. Promotes cell death through interaction with BCL2L1 that releases and activates BAX.
B1W4DT	Urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor	PLAUR; MO3; UPAR	Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor; Urokinase plasminogen activator receptor; Monocyte activation antigenMo3; CD87 antigen; CD87	Protein	Acts as a receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator. Plays a role in localizing and promoting plasmin formation. Mediates the proteolysis-independent signal transduction activation effects of U-PA. It is subject to negative-feedback regulation by U-PA which cleaves it into an inactive form.
