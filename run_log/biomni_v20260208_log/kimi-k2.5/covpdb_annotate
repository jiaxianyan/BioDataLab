Inhibitors of GMII are potential cancer therapeutics, but their usefulness is limited by off- target effects, which produce  \\(\\alpha\\)  - mannosidosis- like symptoms. Despite many structural and mechanistic studies of GMII, we still lack a potent and selective inhibitor of this enzyme. Here, we synthesized manno- epicyclophellitol epoxide and aziridines and demonstrate their covalent modification and time- dependent inhibition of GMII. Application of fluorescent manno- epi- cyclophellitol aziridine derivatives enabled activity- based protein profiling of  \\(\\alpha\\)  - mannosidases from both human cell lysate and mouse tissue extracts. Synthesized probes also facilitated a fluorescence polarization- based screen for dGMII inhibitors. We identified seven previously unknown inhibitors of GMII from a library of over 350 iminosugars and investigated their binding modalities through X- ray crystallography. Our results reveal previously unobserved inhibitor binding modes and promising scaffolds for the generation of selective GMII inhibitors.\nLine 19: \n\nLine 33: In the pursuit of new inhibitors of GMII we have applied the considerable power of cyclophellitol- like activity- based probes (ABPs).  \\({ }^{20}\\)  Herein we report the covalent inhibition of GMII with manno- epi- cyclophellitol epoxide and aziridine. A fluorescent derivative of the manno- epi- cyclophellitol aziridine enabled activity- based protein profiling (ABPP) of GH38  \\(\\alpha\\) - mannosidases in both cells overexpressing human GH38s and mouse tissue extracts. This labeling could be reduced with known inhibitors of GH38s. We next developed a high- throughput fluorescence polarization ABPP screen for  \\(\\alpha\\) - mannosidase inhibitors. Screening of our in- house focused library of over 350 iminosugars revealed seven previously unidentified GMII inhibitors, some of which were found by X- ray crystallography to bind in modes distinct from previously observed inhibitors. Together this gives us fresh insight into the design of GMII inhibitors and lead compounds for the creation of second- generation GMII inhibitors while also providing a high- throughput screening protocol for future library assessment.\nLine 34: \n\nLine 39: Both the manno- epi- cyclophellitol epoxide (1) and aziridine (2) were synthesized (see Figure 2 and the Supporting\nLine 40: \n\nLine 44: Information for synthetic details) to ascertain whether these inhibitors could target dGMII. When 1 and 2 were incubated with recombinant dGMII, we observed that both displayed time- dependent inhibition, which is typical for cyclophellitol- type inhibitors (see Figure S1). To compare the reactivity of these two compounds, second- order rate constants  \\(\\left(k_{\\text{inact}} / K_{\\text{I}}\\right)\\)  were determined using 4- methylumbelliferyl  \\(\\alpha\\) - D- mannopyranoside (MU-  \\(\\alpha\\) - Man) as a substrate. The  \\(k_{\\text{inact}} / K_{\\text{I}}\\)  value for 1 was determined to be  \\(50 \\pm 5 \\mathrm{min}^{- 1} \\mathrm{M}^{- 1}\\) , while the observed inhibition constant for aziridine 2 was over 100- fold higher  \\(\\left(5500 \\pm 100 \\mathrm{min}^{- 1} \\mathrm{M}^{- 1}\\right)\\) . This enhanced inhibition of 2 is consistent with the trend previously observed for  \\(\\alpha\\) - glucosidases by epi- cyclophellitol epoxides and aziridines.  \\({ }^{26}\\)\nLine 45: \n\nLine 46: We next obtained a crystal structure of dGMII that had been soaked with aziridine 2. The reacted manno- epi- cyclophellitol moiety is covalently linked to the nucleophile Asp204 in the X- ray structure (Figure 3B). This structure clearly shows the opening of the aziridine ring resulting from nucleophilic attack at the pseudoanomeric carbon (Figure 3A). The resulting enzyme- bound cyclitol structure displays a  \\({ }^{1} \\mathrm{~S}_{5}\\)  skew boat conformation, which is consistent with the proposed  \\({ }^{0} \\mathrm{~S}_{2} / \\mathrm{B}_{2,5} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{B}_{2,5}{}_{2}^{+} \\rightarrow {}^{1} \\mathrm{~S}_{5}\\)  reaction itinerary for GH38  \\(\\alpha\\) - mannosidases.  \\({ }^{21,27}\\)  Comparison to the structure of 2- deoxy- 2- fluoro- D- mannose bound to the dGMII D341N acid/base mutant  \\({ }^{21}\\)\nLine 47: \n\nLine 49: Figure 3.

To determine whether human mannosidases would react with the cyclophellitol aziridine probes within complex mixtures, all five human GH38  \\(\\alpha\\) - mannosidases (epididylmis- specific  \\(\\alpha\\) - mannosidase (hEpman), hGMII, hLAM, hMan2A2, and hMan2C1) were individually cloned and expressed in HEK293T cells, and extracts thereof treated with  \\(3\\mu \\mathrm{M}\\)  ABP 4 in buffers with  \\(\\mathrm{pH}\\)  between 4 and 7.5 for  \\(30\\mathrm{min}\\)  at  \\(37^{\\circ}C\\) . All five human GH38s could be detected by in- gel fluorescence scanning of gels containing SDS- PAGE- separated proteins with intensities greater than that seen for a mock (no transfection) control. In addition, each of the five cloned enzymes proved to react with the probe in a  \\(\\mathrm{pH}\\) - dependent manner. Lysates of cells transfected with the Golgi- resident hGMII and hMan2A2 and treated with 4 gave similar labeling patterns with bands at approximately  \\(140\\mathrm{kDa}\\)  and maximal read- out at  \\(\\mathrm{pH}5.5 - 6.0\\)\nLine 56: \n\nLine 122: Manno- epi- cyclophellitols have proven to be powerful tools for the study of GH38  \\(\\alpha\\)  - mannosidases and the identification of new inhibitors. The epoxide and aziridine analogues and fluorescent derivatives are covalent time- dependent inhibitors. X- ray crystallography has revealed the  \\({}^{1}S_{5}\\)  conformation of these cyclophellitols, which is consistent with theoretical predictions for the glycosyl- enzyme intermediate. Fluorescent derivatives have enabled the profiling of tissue- dependent GH38 activity and a previously unseen proteolyzed form of hEpman. Additionally, a FluoPol- ABPP screen with excellent characteristics and low substrate and enzyme requirements was developed using the fluorescently tagged manno- epi- cyclophellitol aziridine. This screen revealed seven new inhibitors of both dGMII and hGMII, including D- lyxo- configured pyrrolidines, deoxynojirimycins, hydroxylated piperidines, and an alkylated glucoinidazole. X- ray crystallography of these compounds bound to dGMII revealed both new binding modes and potential sites for inhibitor diversification. This work sets the stage for future development of selective GMII inhibitors. Furthermore, the low material cost in terms of both enzyme and substrate of the screen developed herein will enable the screening of  \\(\\alpha\\)  - mannosidases, which may only be expressed in small quantities. This in turn should enable the screening for inhibitors of all human  \\(\\alpha\\)  - mannosidases.\nLine 123: \n</observation>"
