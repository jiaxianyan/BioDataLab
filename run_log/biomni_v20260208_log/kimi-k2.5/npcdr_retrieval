The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\nImport file: assistant.tool_biodatalab.support_tools\n====================================================\nMethod: read_function_source_code\n  Description: Read the source code of a function from any module path.\n  Required Parameters:\n    - function_name (str): Fully qualified function name (e.g., 'bioagentos.tool.support_tools.write_python_code') [Default: None]\n\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module.

Emerging evidence suggests that resistance to venetoclax arises through multiple pathways, including the overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins, such as MCL1 and BCL2L1, mitochondrial adaptations, metabolic rewiring, and genetic mutations in key regulators, such as TP53 and KMT2A. Phytochemicals, including curcumin, quercetin, triptolide, and parthenolide, have demonstrated anti-leukemic and chemosensitizing activities by modulating BCL2 family proteins and associated apoptotic pathways. Furthermore, in silico docking analyses indicated that several terpenoids possess strong binding affinities to BCL2 protein, in some cases outperforming venetoclax, highlighting their potential as alternative or complementary agents. Preclinical studies underscore the ability of phytochemicals to synergize with venetoclax, enhancing apoptosis and reducing leukemic burden while exhibiting minimal toxicity to normal hematopoietic cells. These bioactive compounds exert pleiotropic effects by modulating redox homeostasis, microRNA expression, epigenetic remodelling, and mitochondrial function, offering a multi-targeted approach to overcoming drug resistance. Despite their promise, translational challenges persist, notably poor solubility, limited bioavailability, and insufficient clinical validation of these compounds. Future research should prioritize the development of advanced delivery systems, such as nanoparticle formulations, and initiate well-designed clinical trials to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of phytochemical-venetoclax combinations in AML.\n================================================================================\n\n================================================================================\nPMID: 41179371\nTITLE: Elucidating the Anticancer Mechanisms of Tetrahydroxycurcumin: A Comprehensive Review of Preclinical Studies.\nABSTRACT: One significant reductive metabolite of curcumin, tetrahydroxycurcumin (THC), is a promising oncology candidate because of its multifunctional bioactivities. Preclinical data indicate that THC has a strong anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer profile, and as such, it is a better alternative to curcumin in treatment. Mechanistically, THC regulates important transcriptional factors that are involved in tumorigenesis, specifically nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1). Uncontrolled proliferation, inflammation, and resistance to apoptosis have been linked to aberrant activation of these pathways. Inhibition of NF-kB and AP-1 induced by THC suppresses cancer cell survival signaling and triggers apoptotic cell death. Simultaneously, THC inhibits the action of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are involved in the degradation of extra cells and metastatic spread, and promote tumor invasion and metastasis. Experimental research has also shown the effectiveness of THC in various cancers such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, and skin cancer. It is important to note that THC increases the therapeutic index of traditional chemotherapeutics, where they show synergistic interactions and counteract drug resistance mechanisms, which is a key obstacle in clinical oncology. THC has better physiological stability and bioavailability compared to its parent molecule, a characteristic that alleviates one of the greatest translational limitations of curcumin. This review highlights the molecular processes underlying the anticancer action of THC, its possible use as a single agent and as an adjuvant to already established chemotherapeutic protocols, and the translational issues that need to be overcome to achieve clinical acceptance. Together, the existing evidence supports THC as an attractive future cancer therapeutic with the potential to improve treatment outcomes and overcome drug resistance.\n================================================================================\n\n================================================================================\nPMID: 41174334\nTITLE: Advancement in nanocarrier-mediated delivery of herbal bioactives: from bench to beside.\nABSTRACT: The resurgence of interest in traditional herbal remedies stems from an increasing appreciation for their complex phytochemical profiles and potential for synergistic therapeutic effects. However, the therapeutic potential of plant extracts is often limited by poor absorption and potential toxicity related to conventional delivery methods. This review explores the application of nanocarrier-mediated delivery systems, such as nanoparticles (NPs), liposomes, and nanoemulsions, to address these challenges. These biocompatible carriers offer enhanced stability and targeted delivery of herbal compounds, improving their efficacy and reducing unwanted side effects. By enabling precise distribution, nanotechnology optimizes the potency of herbal medicine across diverse applications, including regenerative medicine, wound healing, anticancer, and infection treatment. This review provides a systematic description of successful applications of nano-delivery technologies, nanoparticles, liposomes, nanoemulsions, and hybrid carriers, for the targeted delivery of some well-characterized herbal bioactives (curcumin, allicin, berberine, resveratrol etc.) and the enhanced therapeutic performance of herbal bioactives across a variety of preclinical models.\n================================================================================\n\n================================================================================\nPMID: 41164768\nTITLE: A comprehensive review of alkaloids in cancer therapy: focusing on molecular mechanisms and synergistic potential of piperine in colorectal cancer.\nABSTRACT: Alkaloids exhibit a wide range of anticancer activities, including the induction of apoptosis, regulation of autophagy, arrest of the cell cycle, inhibition of angiogenesis, and disruption of oncogenic signaling pathways. Among these compounds, piperine, a piperidine alkaloid derived from black pepper, demonstrates multifaceted activity against colorectal cancer (CRC). Preclinical studies indicate that piperine induces apoptosis through mitochondrial and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated mechanisms, arrests the cell cycle at the G(0)/G(1) and S phases, and suppresses oncogenic signaling pathways, such as Wnt/beta-catenin, STAT3/Snail-EMT, and PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways. Furthermore, it modulates inflammatory and oxidative stress responses by inhibiting NF-kappaB and activating Nrf2/Keap1 signaling while reducing angiogenesis via Src/EGFR-IL-8 regulation. These multi-targeted actions result in decreased proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis of CRC cells. In addition to its intrinsic anticancer properties, piperine serves as a potent natural bio-enhancer. Combination studies revealed synergistic effects with chemotherapeutics (celecoxib, apatinib), radiotherapy, and nutraceuticals (curcumin, resveratrol, and cannabinoids), significantly enhancing therapeutic efficacy and overcoming drug resistance. However, its pharmacokinetic limitations-poor aqueous solubility, rapid metabolism, and low oral bioavailability-pose challenges to its clinical application. Pharmacokinetic analyses reveal high lipophilicity, extensive distribution, and rapid elimination, necessitating innovative strategies to improve systemic stability. Recent advancements include nano-formulations (liposomal, polymeric, and lipid-polymer hybrids) and structural analogs, which increase solubility, stability, bioavailability, and targeted delivery, thereby increasing anticancer efficacy. A comparative evaluation with other alkaloids indicates that while piperine exhibits moderate direct cytotoxicity relative to agents such as camptothecin or berberine, its unique value lies in its broad pathway modulation ability and synergistic potential as an adjuvant. Collectively, mechanistic insights, pharmacologic evaluations, and combinational strategies establish piperine as a promising multifunctional agent for CRC prevention and therapy. Nonetheless, standardized preclinical methodologies, detailed pharmacokinetic profiling, and well-structured early-phase clinical trials are critical to validate its translational potential and facilitate its integration into colorectal cancer management.\n================================================================================\n\n================================================================================\nPMID: 41105346\nTITLE: Targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome with natural products for ischemia-reperfusion injury across organs: mechanisms, structure-activity relationships, and delivery innovations.\nABSTRACT: The review provides a comprehensive study of the therapeutic potential of natural products targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome to mitigate ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury across multiple organs. Excessive activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome triggers inflammatory cascades, cytokine release, pyroptosis, and tissue damage that exacerbate I/R injury in conditions such as ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, and organ transplantation. It emphasizes the central pathological role of NLRP3 inflammasome activation in I/R injury and the critical need for effective inhibitors. It systematically presents pharmacological mechanisms of various phytochemicals-including glycyrrhizin, isoliquiritigenin, celastrol, colchicine, curcumin, quercetin, ferulic acid, and resveratrol-and their specific inhibitory actions on NLRP3 via A</observation>"
