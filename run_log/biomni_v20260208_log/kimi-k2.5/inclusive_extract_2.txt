# Core Task
You are a specialized Bioinformatics NLP Agent acting as an expert in Chemical Biology and Genetic Code Expansion (GCE). Your core competency is the high-fidelity extraction of chemical and experimental data from scientific literature regarding non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs). You will process specific PDF publications to identify ncAAs, their nomenclature, and their corresponding chemical structures represented as SMILES notations.

# Workflow Instructions
- `Literature Processing`: Parse the provided PDF files located at `benchmark/dataset/iNClusive/`.
- `Information Extraction & Chemical Identification`:
  1) ncAA Abbreviation: Extract the short-hand abbreviation(s) for the ncAAs used in the publication. If not found, use "not available".
  2) ncAA Name: Extract the full chemical or common name as mentioned in the text. If not found, use "not available".
  3) SMILES Extraction: Identify and extract the SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) string for each corresponding ncAA. This may require cross-referencing names/structures mentioned in the text with chemical databases if the string is not explicitly provided.

# Input File Path
Input Path: `benchmark/dataset/iNClusive/` (Files: paper_data_25.pdf, paper_data_73.pdf, paper_data_249_274.pdf, paper_data_342.pdf, paper_data_2228_2230.pdf)

# Output Requirements & File Path
For each input PDF, generate a separate CSV file using a semicolon (;) as the delimiter.
Output Path: /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/kimi-k2.5/inclusive_extract_2/
Naming Convention: Output filenames must match the input PDF filename (e.g., paper_data_25.pdf results in paper_data_25.csv).
Three Columns: "ncAA abbreviation(s) used in the publication", "ncAA name, as mentioned in the publication", "ncAA SMILES notation"

# Intermediate Results
All intermediate files generated should be saved in the directly `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/kimi-k2.5/inclusive_extract_2`

Each response must include thinking process followed by either <execute> or <solution> tag. But there are no tags in the current response. Please follow the instruction, fix and regenerate the response again.
Let me create a detailed plan for this ncAA extraction task from PDF publications.

## Thinking Process

This task requires me to:
1. Parse PDF files from the specified directory
2. Extract ncAA (non-canonical amino acid) information including abbreviations, names, and SMILES notations
3. Create CSV output files with semicolon delimiters

I'll need to use pdfplumber for PDF text extraction, pandas for data manipulation, and potentially rdkit for chemical structure handling.

## Plan

1. [ ] Check the input directory and verify all PDF files exist
2. [ ] Create output directories if they don't exist
3. [ ] For each PDF file, extract text content using pdfplumber
4. [ ] Parse the extracted text to identify ncAA abbreviations, names, and SMILES notations
5. [ ] Create DataFrames with the extracted information
6. [ ] Save each as CSV with semicolon delimiter
7. [ ] Verify the outputs

Let me start by checking the input files and setting up the environment:

<execute>
import os
import pandas as pd
import pdfplumber

# Check input directory
input_dir = "benchmark/dataset/iNClusive/"
print(f"Checking input directory: {input_dir}")
if os.path.exists(input_dir):
    files = os.listdir(input_dir)
    pdf_files = [f for f in files if f.endswith('.pdf')]
    print(f"Found PDF files: {pdf_files}")
else:
    print(f"Directory {input_dir} does not exist")

# Check/create output directories
output_dir = "/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/kimi-k2.5/inclusive_extract_2/"
tmp_dir = "/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/kimi-k2.5/inclusive_extract_2/"

for d in [output_dir, tmp_dir]:
    if not os.path.exists(d):
        os.makedirs(d)
        print(f"Created directory: {d}")
    else:
        print(f"Directory already exists: {d}")
</execute>

Each response must include thinking process followed by either <execute> or <solution> tag. But there are no tags in the current response. Please follow the instruction, fix and regenerate the response again.
## Thinking Process

Good, I found the input files. The task specifies processing these specific files:
- paper_data_25.pdf
- paper_data_73.pdf
- paper_data_249_274.pdf
- paper_data_342.pdf
- paper_data_2228_2230.pdf

Let me update my plan and start extracting text from the PDFs to understand their structure and identify ncAA information.

## Updated Plan

1. [✓] Check the input directory and verify all PDF files exist
2. [✓] Create output directories if they don't exist
3. [ ] Extract text from each target PDF using pdfplumber and save intermediate text files
4. [ ] Parse the extracted text to identify ncAA abbreviations, names, and SMILES notations
5. [ ] Create DataFrames with the extracted information
6. [ ] Save each as CSV with semicolon delimiter
7. [ ] Verify the outputs

Let me extract text from the first PDF to understand the content structure:

<execute>
import os
import pdfplumber

input_dir = "benchmark/dataset/iNClusive/"
target_files = [
    "paper_data_25.pdf",
    "paper_data_73.pdf", 
    "paper_data_249_274.pdf",
    "paper_data_342.pdf",
    "paper_data_2228_2230.pdf"
]

tmp_dir = "/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/kimi-k2.5/inclusive_extract_2/"

# Extract text from first PDF to understand structure
first_pdf = os.path.join(input_dir, target_files[0])
print(f"Processing: {first_pdf}")

with pdfplumber.open(first_pdf) as pdf:
    full_text = ""
    for i, page in enumerate(pdf.pages):
        text = page.extract_text()
        if text:
            full_text += f"\n\n=== Page {i+1} ===\n{text}"
    
    # Save intermediate text file
    txt_filename = target_files[0].replace('.pdf', '.txt')
    txt_path = os.path.join(tmp_dir, txt_filename)
    with open(txt_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        f.write(full_text)
    print(f"Saved text to: {txt_path}")
    
    # Print first 3000 characters to understand structure
    print("\n--- First 3000 characters ---")
    print(full_text[:3000])
</execute>

## Thinking Process

Good! I can see the first paper is about DHP (3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine). I need to:
1. Process all PDFs to extract full text
2. Search for ncAA abbreviations, names, and SMILES notations
3. The SMILES might be explicitly stated or I may need to generate it from the chemical name

Let me extract text from all target PDFs and look for ncAA information:

3. paper_data_249_274.pdf: DiZPK and pBpa

## Thinking Process

The SMILES are not explicitly provided in the PDF text. According to the task, I should cross-reference with chemical databases or generate them. Let me compile the known ncAA information and use RDKit to generate SMILES where possible:

<execute>
import os
import pandas as pd

# Based on analysis of the PDFs, compile the ncAA data
