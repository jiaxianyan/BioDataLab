The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module. For example:\nfrom [module_name] import [function_name]\n\n- Biological data lake\nYou can access a biological data lake at the following path: ./operation_env/database_lake.\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant datasets:\nEach item is listed with its description to help you understand its contents.\n----\n\n----\n\n- Software Library:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant libraries that you can use:\nEach library is listed with its description to help you understand its functionality.\n----\npdfplumber:\n  [Python Package] Plumb a PDF for detailed information about each text character,\n  rectangle, and line (Essential for reading papers).\npytesseract:\n  [Python Package] Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool\n  for python.\npillow:\n  [Python Package] The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities\n  to your Python interpreter.\nbeautifulsoup4:\n  [Python Package] Screen-scraping library to extract data from HTML and XML\n  files.\nbiopython: [Python Package] A set of freely available tools for biological computation.\nseqkit:\n  [CLI Tools] A cross-platform and ultrafast toolkit for FASTA/Q file\n  manipulation.\nblast: [CLI Tools] Basic Local Alignment Search Tool.\nncbi-datasets-cli: [CLI Tools] CLI tool to query and download biological data from NCBI.\n----\n\n- Note on using R packages and Bash scripts:\n  - R packages: Use subprocess.run(['Rscript', '-e', 'your R code here']) in Python, or use the #!R marker in your execute block.\n  - Bash scripts and commands: Use the #!BASH marker in your execute block for both simple commands and complex shell scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, etc.\n        "

You will process a specific PDF to locate plasmid nomenclature and cross-reference these clues to extract the complete protein sequences for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) and the complete RNA sequences for tRNAs.\n\n# Workflow Instructions\n- `Literature Mining`: Analyze the provided PDF file to identify plasmid names, accession numbers, or specific synthetic biology constructs related to the orthogonal translation system.\n- `Database Retrieval`: Using the identified clues, query public databases (Addgene, NCBI GenBank, or UniProt) to retrieve:\n  1) The full-length protein sequence of the aaRS (including any specified mutations);\n  2) The full-length RNA sequence of the suppressor tRNA.\n- `Entity Identification & Formatting`: \n  1) aaRS ID: Construct using the syntax [Org Abbr]-[Natural Substrate]RS ([Mutations/Wild Type]). (e.g., Ec-MetRS (wild type)).\n  2) tRNA ID: Construct using the syntax [Org Abbr]-tRNA [Natural AA] [Anticodon]. (e.g., Bs-tRNA Tyr CUA).\n- `Data Structuring`: Map the retrieved sequences to their respective IDs into two separate dictionaries within a single JSON object.\n\n# Input File Path\nInput Path: benchmark/dataset/iNClusive/science.1060077.pdf\n\n# Output Requirements & File Path\nGenerate a JSON file containing A dictionary with two keys where one key is the aaRS ID and its value is the full protein sequence (string), and the other one key is tRNA ID and its value is the full RNA sequence (string).\nSave Path: /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/kimi-k2.5/inclusive_extract_3.json\n\n# Output Example (For Reference Only)\n{\n    \"Ec-MetRS (L13G)\": \"KAKHGKGVLGPKPEAGKAKPAAKPA\",\n    \"Ec-tRNA Met CAT\": \"CCGGCGGTA\",\n}\n\n# Intermediate Results\nAll intermediate files generated should be saved in the directly `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/kimi-k2.5/inclusive_extract_3`\n"
