The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\nImport file: assistant.tool_biodatalab.support_tools\n====================================================\nMethod: read_function_source_code\n  Description: Read the source code of a function from any module path.\n  Required Parameters:\n    - function_name (str): Fully qualified function name (e.g., 'bioagentos.tool.support_tools.write_python_code') [Default: None]\n\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module.

We evaluated zilovertamab vedotin in participants with \n      previously treated metastatic solid tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This phase 2, \n      open-label, nonrandomized study (NCT04504916) enrolled participants with \n      metastatic triple-negative breast cancer, hormone receptor-positive breast \n      cancer, nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer, platinum-resistant ovarian \n      cancer, or pancreatic cancer. Participants received zilovertamab vedotin </=2.5 \n      mg/kg once every 3 weeks (Q1/3W) or <1.75 mg/kg twice every 3 weeks (Q2/3W). The \n      primary endpoint was objective response rate per RECIST version 1.1 by blinded \n      independent central review. ROR1 protein expression was correlated with clinical \n      outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 102 participants were enrolled (Q1/3W, n = 70; \n      Q2/3W, n = 32). The objective response rate was 1% [95% confidence interval (CI), \n      0%-8%] with Q1/3W dosing (one partial response, hormone \n      receptor-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer cohort) and 0% with Q2/3W dosing. \n      The median progression-free survival (95% CI) was 2.3 (2.0-4.1) and 1.9 (1.7-2.1) \n      months, respectively; the median overall survival (95% CI) was 8.3 (5.2-10.3) and \n      5.5 (4.4-11.0) months, respectively. Across dosing regimens, treatment-related \n      adverse events were reported in 85 participants (83%), most commonly fatigue \n      (29%) and nausea (28%). Treatment-related peripheral neuropathy occurred in 8%. \n      Treatment-related adverse events led to dose interruption/reduction in 32 \n      participants (31%) and permanent treatment discontinuation in 7 (7%). Tissue for \n      ROR1 IHC was available on 17 participants, with only 3 (all nonresponders) \n      showing ROR1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Zilovertamab vedotin had minimal antitumor \n      activity, with only a single responder, and manageable safety in participants \n      with previously treated metastatic solid tumors. SIGNIFICANCE: Zilovertamab \n      vedotin had minimal antitumor activity and manageable safety in participants with \n      previously treated metastatic solid tumors of various histologic subtypes. The \n      results suggest that further development of zilovertamab vedotin in these solid \n      tumors is not warranted.\nCI  - (c)2025 The Authors; Published by the American Association for Cancer Research.\nFAU - Meric-Bernstam, Funda\nAU  - Meric-Bernstam F\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-6816-6072\nAD  - Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics, Division of Cancer Medicine, \n      The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.\nFAU - Gutierrez, Martin\nAU  - Gutierrez M\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-3156-3159\nAD  - Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.\nFAU - Sanz-Garcia, Enrique\nAU  - Sanz-Garcia E\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-3119-3832\nAD  - Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, \n      Toronto, Canada.\nFAU - Villa, Diego\nAU  - Villa D\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-4625-3009\nAD  - University of British Columbia, BC Cancer Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, Vancouver, \n      Canada.\nFAU - Zhang, Jun\nAU  - Zhang J\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-7886-6187\nAD  - Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of \n      Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas.\nAD  - Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Cancer Biology, University of Kansas \n      Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas.\nFAU - Friedmann, Jennifer\nAU  - Friedmann J\nAUID- ORCID: 0009-0000-1149-3726\nAD  - Gerald Bronfman Department of Oncology, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, \n      Canada.\nFAU - Yan, Fengting\nAU  - Yan F\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0002-0234-4937\nAD  - Swedish Cancer Institute, Seattle, Washington.\nFAU - Socinski, Mark A\nAU  - Socinski MA\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-2915-9325\nAD  - AdventHealth Cancer Institute, Orlando, Florida.\nFAU - Sarantopoulos, John\nAU  - Sarantopoulos J\nAUID- ORCID: 0009-0002-4395-136X\nAD  - Institute for Drug Development, Mays Cancer Center at University of Texas Health \n      San Antonio MD Anderson Cancer Center, San Antonio, Texas.\nFAU - Raez, Luis E\nAU  - Raez LE\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-2669-5771\nAD  - Memorial Cancer Institute/Florida Atlantic University (FAU), Miami, Florida.\nFAU - Chu, Quincy S\nAU  - Chu QS\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-4814-3126\nAD  - Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Oncology, Cross Cancer Institute, \n      Edmonton, Canada.\nFAU - Chenard-Poirier, Maxime\nAU  - Chenard-Poirier M\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-5800-0124\nAD  - CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada.\nFAU - Chatterjee, Manash S\nAU  - Chatterjee MS\nAUID- ORCID: 0009-0005-2706-1342\nAD  - Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, New Jersey.\nFAU - Ren, Hong\nAU  - Ren H\nAUID- ORCID: 0009-0006-3126-6495\nAD  - Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, New Jersey.\nFAU - Liu, Qi\nAU  - Liu Q\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0001-5326-3419\nAD  - Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, New Jersey.\nFAU - Levine, Douglas A\nAU  - Levine DA\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-1038-8232\nAD  - Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, New Jersey.\nFAU - Jhaveri, Komal L\nAU  - Jhaveri KL\nAUID- ORCID: 0000-0003-0472-1254\nAD  - Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.\nAD  - Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.\nLA  - eng\nGR  - Cancer Center Support Grant P30 CA054174/Institute for Drug Development, Mays \n      Cancer Center at University of Texas Health San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA/\nGR  - Merck Sharp Dohme LLC, a subsidiary of Merck Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA (MSD)/\nGR  - P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States\nGR  - Support Grant P30 CA008748/Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center/\nGR  - P30 CA054174/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States\nPT  - Clinical Trial, Phase II\nPT  - Journal Article\nPT  - Multicenter Study\nPL  - United States\nTA  - Cancer Res Commun\nJT  - Cancer research communications\nJID - 9918281580506676\nRN  - 0 (Immunoconjugates)\nRN  - EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors)\nRN  - EC 2.7.10.1 (ROR1 protein, human)\nSB  - IM\nMH  - Humans\nMH  - Female\nMH  - Middle Aged\nMH  - Aged\nMH  - Male\nMH  - Adult\nMH  - *Immunoconjugates/adverse effects/administration & dosage/therapeutic use\nMH  - *Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors/antagonists & \n      inhibitors/metabolism\nMH  - Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology\nMH  - Neoplasm Metastasis\nMH  - Aged, 80 and over\nMH  - Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy\nMH  - Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology\nMH  - Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology\nPMC - PMC12442023\nCOIS- F.
