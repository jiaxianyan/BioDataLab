The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\nImport file: assistant.tool_biodatalab.support_tools\n====================================================\nMethod: read_function_source_code\n  Description: Read the source code of a function from any module path.\n  Required Parameters:\n    - function_name (str): Fully qualified function name (e.g., 'bioagentos.tool.support_tools.write_python_code') [Default: None]\n\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module.

All QC steps have been applied.\n\nNow we should update the plan checklist.\n\nPlan:\n1. [\u2713] Load the dataset from the given path: `benchmark/dataset/SCovid/GSE182298`\n2. [\u2713] Check the dataset format and load it into an appropriate data structure (likely using scanpy or Seurat)\n3. [\u2713] Perform QC filtering: filter out cells with fewer than 200 detected genes\n4. [\u2713] Filter out genes detected in fewer than 3 cells\n5. [\u2713] Calculate mitochondrial gene percentage (genes starting with \"MT-\")\n6. [\u2713] Determine the tissue type (need to infer from dataset or assume it's Liver? The instruction says \"If the input tissue is Liver\" - we need to know what tissue this dataset is. We'll need to examine metadata)\n7. [\u2713] Apply mitochondrial filtering: if tissue is Liver, remove cells with >50% mitochondrial genes; otherwise >20%\n8. [\u2713] Save the list of remaining valid cell barcodes to the specified CSV file\n9. [\u2713] Ensure all temp data is saved in the specified temp directory\n\nAll steps completed. The final output is ready.\n\nNow we can provide the solution.\n\n<solution>\nThe QC filtering has been successfully performed on the GSE182298 dataset. The filtered cell barcodes (39,328 cells passing QC) are saved in the file `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/deepseek-v3.2-fast/qc_passed_barcodes.csv`. The file contains a single column without header, with each row formatted as `<GSMID>_barcode`. The filtering steps included:\n\n1. Removing cells with fewer than 200 detected genes.\n2. Removing genes detected in fewer than 3 cells.\n3. Calculating mitochondrial gene percentage (genes starting with \"MT-\").\n4. Applying tissue\u2011specific mitochondrial thresholds: since the dataset contains brain tissues (Olfactory Bulb and Frontal Lobe), a threshold of 20% was used (non\u2011liver tissue).\n5. Saving the filtered AnnData objects for each sample in the temporary directory `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/deepseek-v3.2-fast/scovid_refinement/`.\n\nThe output file is ready for downstream analysis.\n</solution>"
