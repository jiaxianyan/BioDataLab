The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\nImport file: assistant.tool_biodatalab.support_tools\n====================================================\nMethod: read_function_source_code\n  Description: Read the source code of a function from any module path.\n  Required Parameters:\n    - function_name (str): Fully qualified function name (e.g., 'bioagentos.tool.support_tools.write_python_code') [Default: None]\n\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module. For example:\nfrom [module_name] import [function_name]\n\n- Biological data lake\nYou can access a biological data lake at the following path: ./operation_env/database_lake.\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant datasets:\nEach item is listed with its description to help you understand its contents.\n----\n\n----\n\n- Software Library:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant libraries that you can use:\nEach library is listed with its description to help you understand its functionality.\n----\nbiopython: [Python Package] A set of freely available tools for biological computation.\nncbi-datasets-cli: [CLI Tools] CLI tool to query and download biological data from NCBI.\n----\n\n- Note on using R packages and Bash scripts:\n  - R packages: Use subprocess.run(['Rscript', '-e', 'your R code here']) in Python, or use the #!R marker in your execute block.\n  - Bash scripts and commands: Use the #!BASH marker in your execute block for both simple commands and complex shell scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, etc.\n        "

The search should employ keywords such as \"Drug Interactions\"[MeSH] or \"drug-drug interaction\", while strictly excluding drug-food and drug-gene interactions by filtering out terms like \"Food-Drug Interactions\"[MeSH Terms], \"food\"[Title], \"Pharmacogenetics\"[MeSH Terms], or \"gene\"[Title/Abstract]. Following the initial search, conduct a detailed abstract analysis to screen for and isolate literature that specifically focuses on clinical or pharmacological interactions between Ciprofloxacin and other pharmaceutical agents, ensuring all irrelevant topics are removed from the final collection.\n\n# Output Requirements & File Path\n- Output format: JSON list of objects. The list must include all articles obtained from the initial PubMed search.\n- Each object must contain exactly two fields:\n  - `\"PMID\"`: PubMed ID as a string\n  - `\"Accepted\"`: Boolean value (`true` if the article meets all inclusion and filtering criteria, `false` otherwise)\n- Save Path: Save the complete list to: `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/deepseek-v3.2-fast/ddinter_retrieval.json`\n- Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/deepseek-v3.2-fast/ddinter_retrieval/`\n\n  # Output Example (For Reference Only)\n[\n  {\n    \"PMID\": \"99999999\",\n    \"Accepted\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"PMID\": \"88888888\",\n    \"Accepted\": true\n  }\n]\n"

[\u2713] Set up the environment: Import necessary libraries (Biopython for PubMed access, json for output)\n2. [\u2713] Construct the PubMed search query with date range, Ciprofloxacin focus, DDI keywords, and exclusion terms\n3. [\u2713] Execute the search and retrieve all PubMed IDs (PMIDs) for articles published between 2021/01/01 and 2021/03/01\n4. [\u2713] For each PMID, fetch the article details (title, abstract, MeSH terms)\n5. [\u2713] Analyze each article's abstract and metadata to determine if it meets inclusion criteria (clinical/pharmacological DDI involving Ciprofloxacin)\n6. [\u2713] Apply filtering to exclude drug-food and drug-gene interactions\n7. [\u2713] Create JSON output with PMID and Accepted status\n8. [\u2713] Save the JSON to the specified output path\n9. [\u2713] Store intermediate files and code in the temporary directory\n\nThe task has been completed. The PubMed search retrieved 11 articles published between 2021/01/01 and 2021/03/01 that mention Ciprofloxacin and drug interactions while excluding food and gene-related interactions. After detailed abstract analysis, 7 articles were accepted as focusing on clinical/pharmacological drug-drug interactions involving Ciprofloxacin, while 4 were rejected.\n\n<solution>\n[\n  {\n    \"PMID\": \"34268273\",\n    \"Accepted\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"PMID\": \"33588861\",\n    \"Accepted\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"PMID\": \"33583923\",\n    \"Accepted\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"PMID\": \"33490338\",\n    \"Accepted\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"PMID\": \"33406110\",\n    \"Accepted\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"PMID\": \"33404754\",\n    \"Accepted\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"PMID\": \"33346078\",\n    \"Accepted\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"PMID\": \"32990533\",\n    \"Accepted\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"PMID\": \"32810621\",\n    \"Accepted\": true\n  },\n  {\n    \"PMID\": \"32750918\",\n    \"Accepted\": false\n  },\n  {\n    \"PMID\": \"32482592\",\n    \"Accepted\": false\n  }\n]\n</solution>"
