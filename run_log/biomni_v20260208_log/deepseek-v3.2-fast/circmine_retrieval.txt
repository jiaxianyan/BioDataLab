# Core Task
Search the NCBI GEO database for Series entries published from 2021/01/01 to 2021/01/15 that investigate **circular RNA (circRNA) in Homo sapiens**, and analyze each entry to determine if it provides accessible human circular RNA expression data derived from human biological sources.

# Output Requirements & File Path
- Output format: JSON list of objects. The list must include all Series obtained from the initial GEO search.
- Each object must contain exactly two fields:
  - `"Series"`: The GEO Series accession number (e.g., "GSE164803").
  - `"Accepted"`: Boolean value (`true` if the Series provides accessible human circRNA expression data, `false` otherwise).
- Save Path: Save the complete list to: `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/deepseek-v3.2-fast/circmine_retrieval.json`
- Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/deepseek-v3.2-fast/circmine_retrieval/`

# Output Example (For Reference Only)
[
  {
    "Series": "GSE999999",
    "Accepted": true
  },
  {
    "Series": "GSE888888",
    "Accepted": false
  }
]

I'll start by making a plan to accomplish this task.

**Plan:**

1. [ ] Set up the environment: create necessary directories, load required libraries (GEOquery in R, biopython in Python for potential parsing).
2. [ ] Perform GEO search for Series entries published between 2021-01-01 and 2021-01-15 investigating circular RNA (circRNA) in Homo sapiens.
3. [ ] Extract the GEO Series accession numbers from the search results.
4. [ ] For each Series accession, analyze the entry to determine if it provides accessible human circular RNA expression data derived from human biological sources.
5. [ ] Create a JSON list with objects containing "Series" and "Accepted" fields.
6. [ ] Save the JSON list to the specified output path.

Let's start with step 1.

<execute>
import os
import json
import subprocess
import sys
from datetime import datetime

# Create directories
output_dir = "/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/deepseek-v3.2-fast"
tmp_dir = "/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/deepseek-v3.2-fast/circmine_retrieval"

os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
os.makedirs(tmp_dir, exist_ok=True)

print(f"Created directories:\n- {output_dir}\n- {tmp_dir}")
</execute>
<observation>Created directories:
- /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/deepseek-v3.2-fast
- /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/deepseek-v3.2-fast/circmine_retrieval
</observation>
1. [✓] Set up the environment: create necessary directories, load required libraries (GEOquery in R, biopython in Python for potential parsing).
2. [ ] Perform GEO search for Series entries published between 2021-01-01 and 2021-01-15 investigating circular RNA (circRNA) in Homo sapiens.
3. [ ] Extract the GEO Series accession numbers from the search results.
4. [ ] For each Series accession, analyze the entry to determine if it provides accessible human circular RNA expression data derived from human biological sources.
5. [ ] Create a JSON list with objects containing "Series" and "Accepted" fields.
6. [ ] Save the JSON list to the specified output path.

Now step 2: Perform GEO search. I'll use R's GEOquery package to search GEO via the `getGEO` function with appropriate search terms. However, note that GEOquery's `getGEO` can search by terms but also we can use `geo_search` from the `GEOmetadb` package. But since we have a date range and specific organism and molecule type, we need to construct a query.

Let's first check if GEOquery is available and try to search.

I'll write an R script to search GEO using the `GEOmetadb` package (if available) or use `getGEO` with search terms. The search term: "circular RNA" AND "Homo sapiens" AND "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing" maybe? But we need to filter by date.

Alternatively, we can use the NCBI E-utils via `rentrez` package. But let's try with GEOquery first.

<execute>
#!R
# Check if GEOquery is installed, if not install it
if (!requireNamespace("GEOquery", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("GEOquery", repos="http://cran.r-project.org")
}
library(GEOquery)

# Define search terms
search_term <- '"circular RNA"[Title] AND "Homo sapiens"[Organism] AND "2021/01/01"[PDAT] : "2021/01/15"[PDAT]'
# Note: PDAT is publication date

# Try to search using getGEO with gse=True
# getGEO can accept a search string via 'gse' parameter? Actually getGEO can download by accession.
# For search, we might need to use geo_search from GEOmetadb.
# Let's try GEOmetadb if available.

if (!requireNamespace("GEOmetadb", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("GEOmetadb", repos="http://cran.r-project.org")
}
library(GEOmetadb)

# Download GEOmetadb SQLite database if not present
if (!file.exists("GEOmetadb.sqlite")) {
    getSQLiteFile(destdir = ".")
}
con <- dbConnect(SQLite(), "GEOmetadb.sqlite")

# Construct query: we want gse (Series) entries with title containing "circular RNA", organism Homo sapiens, and publication date between 2021-01-01 and 2021-01-15
query <- "SELECT gse FROM gse WHERE title LIKE '%circular RNA%' AND organism LIKE '%Homo sapiens%' AND submission_date BETWEEN '2021-01-01' AND '2021-01-15'"
result <- dbGetQuery(con, query)
dbDisconnect(con)

print(result)
</execute>
<observation>ERROR: Code execution timed out after 150 seconds. Please try with simpler inputs or break your task into smaller steps.</observation>
The query timed out. Possibly downloading the GEOmetadb database is too large. Let's try a different approach: use NCBI's E-utils via `rentrez` package in R to search GEO directly.

We'll break step 2 into smaller parts: first search for GEO Series with the given criteria using E-utils.

<execute>
#!R
# Use rentrez to search GEO (GSE) entries
if (!requireNamespace("rentrez", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("rentrez", repos="http://cran.r-project.org")
}
library(rentrez)

# Search term: "circular RNA"[Title] AND "Homo sapiens"[Organism] AND "GSE"[Entry Type] AND ("2021/01/01"[PDAT] : "2021/01/15"[PDAT])
# Actually we can search the GEO database (gds) or pubmed? For GEO Series, we can search the gds database.
# Let's search the gds database (Gene Expression Omnibus) for entries with term "circular RNA" and organism Homo sapiens and publication date range.

search_term <- '"circular RNA"[Title] AND "Homo sapiens"[Organism] AND "2021/01/01"[PDAT] : "2021/01/15"[PDAT]'

# Search in gds database (GEO Datasets)
gds_search <- entrez_search(db="gds", term=search_term, retmax=100)
print(gds_search$count)
print(gds_search$ids)

# We need to get the Series accession (GSE) from these IDs. Let's fetch summaries.
if (length(gds_search$ids) > 0) {
    gds_summaries <- entrez_summary(db="gds", id=gds_search$ids)
    # Extract GSE accessions
    gse_accessions <- sapply(gds_summaries, function(x) x$accession)
    print(gse_accessions)
} else {
    print("No results found.")
}
</execute>
<observation>Error running R code:
Error in x$accession : $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors
Calls: sapply -> lapply -> FUN
Execution halted
</observation>
Let's examine the structure of the summaries. The `entrez_summary` returns a list of `esummary` objects. We need to extract the accession field correctly.

<execute>
#!R
library(rentrez)

search_term <- '"circular RNA"[Title] AND "Homo sapiens"[Organism] AND "2021/01/01"[PDAT] : "2021/01/15"[PDAT]'
gds_search <- entrez_search(db="gds", term=search_term, retmax=100)
print(paste("Number of hits:", gds_search$count))

if (gds_search$count > 0) {
    gds_summaries <- entrez_summary(db="gds", id=gds_search$ids)
    # Check structure of first summary
    print(str(gds_summaries[1]))
    # Extract accession
    gse_accessions <- sapply(gds_summaries, function(x) x$accession)
    print(gse_accessions)
}
</execute>
<observation>Error running R code:
Error in x$accession : $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors
Calls: sapply -> lapply -> FUN
Execution halted
</observation>
Let's print the first summary to see its structure.

<execute>
#!R
library(rentrez)

search_term <- '"circular RNA"[Title] AND "Homo sapiens"[Organism] AND "2021/01/01"[PDAT] : "2021/01/15"[PDAT]'
gds_search <- entrez_search(db="gds", term=search_term, retmax=100)
print(paste("Number of hits:", gds_search$count))

if (gds_search$count > 0) {
    gds_summaries <- entrez_summary(db="gds", id=gds_search$ids)
    # Print first summary
    print(gds_summaries[1])
    # Maybe it's a list of lists? Let's check class
    print(class(gds_summaries))
    print(class(gds_summaries[1]))
    # Actually entrez_summary returns a list of esummary objects, but if there's only one id, it returns a single esummary.
    # We can coerce to list.
    if (length(gds_search$ids) == 1) {
        gds_summaries <- list(gds_summaries)
    }
    # Now extract accession
    gse_accessions <- sapply(gds_summaries, function(x) x$accession)
    print(gse_accessions)
}
</execute>
<observation>[1] "Number of hits: 1"
$uid
[1] "200163076"

[1] "esummary" "list"    
[1] "list"
[1] "GSE163076"
</observation>
Great! We have one hit: GSE163076. Let's capture that and also verify that there might be more hits (the count is 1). So we have one Series.

Now we need to analyze this Series to determine if it provides accessible human circular RNA expression data derived from human biological sources.

We'll update the plan:

1. [✓] Set up the environment: create necessary directories, load required libraries (GEOquery in R, biopython in Python for potential parsing).
2. [✓] Perform GEO search for Series entries published between 2021-01-01 and 2021-01-15 investigating circular RNA (circRNA) in Homo sapiens.
3. [ ] Extract the GEO Series accession numbers from the search results.
4. [ ] For each Series accession, analyze the entry to determine if it provides accessible human circular RNA expression data derived from human biological sources.
5. [ ] Create a JSON list with objects containing "Series" and "Accepted" fields.
6. [ ] Save the JSON list to the specified output path.

Step 3: Extract accession numbers. We have GSE163076. Let's store it.

<execute>
#!R
library(rentrez)

search_term <- '"circular RNA"[Title] AND "Homo sapiens"[Organism] AND "2021/01/01"[PDAT] : "2021/01/15"[PDAT]'
gds_search <- entrez_search(db="gds", term=search_term, retmax=100)
print(paste("Number of hits:", gds_search$count))

gse_accessions <- c()
if (gds_search$count > 0) {
    gds_summaries <- entrez_summary(db="gds", id=gds_search$ids)
    # If only one id, coerce to list
    if (length(gds_search$ids) == 1) {
        gds_summaries <- list(gds_summaries)
    }
    gse_accessions <- sapply(gds_summaries, function(x) x$accession)
}
print(gse_accessions)
</execute>
<observation>[1] "Number of hits: 1"
[1] "GSE163076"
</observation>
Now step 4: Analyze each Series entry. We need to determine if the Series provides accessible human circRNA expression data derived from human biological sources.

We can use GEOquery to download the Series (GSE) and examine its metadata, samples, and data types. We'll check:

- Organism: should be Homo sapiens.
- Data type: should be expression data (likely "Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing" or similar).
- Molecule: circular RNA.
- Accessibility: data should be accessible (i.e., there are supplementary files or raw data available).
- Derived from human biological sources: samples should be from human tissues/cells.

We'll write a function to analyze a GSE accession.

First, let's download GSE163076 using GEOquery and inspect.

<execute>
#!R
library(GEOquery)

gse_acc <- "GSE163076"
# Download GSE (might take time)
gse <- getGEO(gse_acc, GSEMatrix = FALSE)  # get GSE as GSE object (not ExpressionSet)
print(paste("Downloaded GSE:", gse_acc))

# Examine metadata
meta <- Meta(gse)
print(names(meta))

# Check organism
organism <- meta$organism_ch1
print(paste("Organism:", organism))

# Check title
title <- meta$title
print(paste("Title:", title))

# Check summary
summary <- meta$summary
print(paste("Summary:", substr(summary, 1, 200)))

# Check sample count
samples <- GSMList(gse)
print(paste("Number of samples:", length(samples)))

# Check sample characteristics (first sample)
if (length(samples) > 0) {
    gsm <- samples[[1]]
    gsm_meta <- Meta(gsm)
    print(paste("Sample organism:", gsm_meta$organism_ch1))
    print(paste("Sample source:", gsm_meta$source_name_ch1))
    print(paste("Sample molecule:", gsm_meta$molecule_ch1))
    print(paste("Sample data type:", gsm_meta$type))
}

# Check for supplementary files
supp_files <- meta$supplementary_file
print(paste("Supplementary files:", supp_files))
</execute>
<observation>[1] "Downloaded GSE: GSE163076"

[1] "Organism: "
[1] "Title: Identification of circular RNA and miRNAs during colorectal cancer progression and metastasis"
[1] "Summary: This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below."
[1] "Number of samples: 22"
[1] "Sample organism: Homo sapiens"
[1] "Sample source: HT29 cells"
[1] "Sample molecule: total RNA"
[1] "Sample data type: SRA"
[1] "Supplementary files: "
</observation>
Interesting: The organism field in the GSE metadata is empty, but the sample organism is Homo sapiens. The title mentions "circular RNA". The summary indicates it's a SuperSeries composed of SubSeries. The sample molecule is "total RNA", not specifically circular RNA. The data type is "SRA" (Sequence Read Archive). There are no supplementary files listed (maybe data is in SRA). 

We need to determine if this Series provides accessible human circRNA expression data. Since it's a SuperSeries, we might need to look at the SubSeries. Also, we need to check if the data is actually circular RNA expression (maybe they derived circRNA from total RNA sequencing). The title suggests they identified circular RNA, so likely they have circRNA data.

But we need to verify if the data is accessible: maybe the raw sequencing data is in SRA, and they might have processed circRNA expression matrices as supplementary files in the SubSeries.

Let's examine the relation field to get SubSeries accessions.

<execute>
#!R
library(GEOquery)

gse <- getGEO("GSE163076", GSEMatrix = FALSE)
meta <- Meta(gse)
relation <- meta$relation
print(relation)
</execute>
<observation>[1] "SuperSeries of: GSE137053"                                      
[2] "SuperSeries of: GSE163074"                                      
[3] "BioProject: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA684603"
</observation>
So there are two SubSeries: GSE137053 and GSE163074. We need to analyze these SubSeries to see if they contain circRNA expression data.

But note: The task is to analyze each Series obtained from the initial GEO search. The initial search gave us GSE163076 (the SuperSeries). Should we also include the SubSeries? The instruction says "Series entries obtained from the initial GEO search". That's only GSE163076. However, we need to determine if this Series provides accessible human circRNA expression data. Since it's a SuperSeries, the data might be in the SubSeries. We need to check if the SuperSeries itself provides the data (maybe via linking to SubSeries). We'll need to examine the SubSeries as part of analyzing GSE163076.

Let's download GSE137053 and GSE163074.

<execute>
#!R
library(GEOquery)

subseries_acc <- c("GSE137053", "GSE163074")
for (acc in subseries_acc) {
    print(paste("Analyzing SubSeries:", acc))
    gse_sub <- try(getGEO(acc, GSEMatrix = FALSE))
    if (class(gse_sub) == "try-error") {
        print(paste("Failed to download", acc))
        next
    }
    meta <- Meta(gse_sub)
    print(paste("Title:", meta$title))
    print(paste("Organism:", meta$organism_ch1))
    print(paste("Type:", meta$type))
    print(paste("Summary:", substr(meta$summary, 1, 300)))
    # Check for supplementary files
    supp <- meta$supplementary_file
    print(paste("Supplementary files:", supp))
    # Check sample molecule
    samples <- GSMList(gse_sub)
    if (length(samples) > 0) {
        gsm <- samples[[1]]
        gsm_meta <- Meta(gsm)
        print(paste("Sample molecule:", gsm_meta$molecule_ch1))
        print(paste("Sample data type:", gsm_meta$type))
    }
    cat("\n")
}

</observation>
Great! GSE137053 has supplementary files: one is "GSE137053_circRNA_DE.xlsx" which likely contains differential expression of circRNAs. That suggests that this SubSeries provides circular RNA expression data. However, note that the organism is empty, but the summary mentions a xenograft mouse model using HT29 human colorectal cancer cell line implanted into SCID mice. So the biological source is human cells (HT29) but grown in mice. Is that considered "derived from human biological sources"? The cells are human, but the model is mouse xenograft. The data is from human cells (HT29). I'd argue yes, it's derived from human biological sources (human cell line). However, the samples are from xenograft tumors (mouse host). The RNA is extracted from the xenograft, which contains human cells. The circRNA data likely reflects human circRNAs.

Also, GSE137053 is about "Identification of circular RNAs during colorectal cancer progression and metastasis using a preclinical mouse model". So it's circRNA data.

GSE163074 is about miRNAs, not circRNA.

Now, the SuperSeries GSE163076 itself does not have supplementary files; the data is in the SubSeries. Does the SuperSeries "provide accessible human circular RNA expression data"? It links to SubSeries that contain the data. The accessibility is via the SubSeries supplementary files. I think we can consider it as providing accessible data because the data is accessible through the SubSeries (which are part of the SuperSeries). However, we need to decide based on the criteria.

Let's also check if the data is expression data (quantitative). The supplementary file is "circRNA_DE.xlsx" which likely contains differential expression values (e.g., counts, FPKM, etc.). That is expression data.

Now, we need to make a decision for GSE163076: Accepted = true or false?

We'll define criteria:

- Series must be about Homo sapiens (organism). The samples are human cells (HT29) even though grown in mouse. The organism field is empty but sample organism is Homo sapiens. Accept.
- Series must provide circular RNA expression data: Yes, via GSE137053.
- Data must be accessible: Yes, via FTP supplementary file.
- Derived from human biological sources: Yes, human cell line.

Thus, Accepted = true.

But we should also consider that the SuperSeries itself may not have the data directly; but the task says "analyze each entry to determine if it provides accessible human circular RNA expression data derived from human biological sources." The entry (Series) includes its SubSeries? Typically, a SuperSeries entry aggregates SubSeries, and the data is provided through SubSeries. I think it's acceptable.

Now, we need to produce the JSON list with all Series from the initial search (only GSE163076). Let's create the JSON.

But before that, we should also double-check if there are any other Series in the date range that we might have missed due to search term limitations. Let's broaden the search to ensure we capture all.

We used `"circular RNA"[Title]`. Maybe there are Series with "circRNA" or "circular RNAs". Let's do a more inclusive search.

<execute>
#!R
library(rentrez)

# Broaden search: circular RNA OR circRNA in title, Homo sapiens, date range
search_term <- '("circular RNA"[Title] OR "circRNA"[Title]) AND "Homo sapiens"[Organism] AND "2021/01/01"[PDAT] : "2021/01/15"[PDAT]'

        gds_summaries <- list(gds_summaries)
    }
    gse_accessions <- sapply(gds_summaries, function(x) x$accession)
    print(gse_accessions)

We have 9 hits, but some are GSM (Samples) not GSE. We need to filter for GSE only. The accession field includes GSE and GSM. We'll filter those starting with "GSE". Also note that the search returned GSM entries because the database "gds" includes both Series and Samples? Actually GDS is GEO Datasets, which includes both Series and Samples? Let's check the summaries to see the entry type.

We can filter by `entrytype` field. Let's examine the summaries.

Great! So we have three GSE Series: GSE164803, GSE163076, GSE164546. We already have GSE163076. We need to analyze GSE164803 and GSE164546 as well.

Now we need to analyze each of these three Series.

Let's update the plan:

1. [✓] Set up the environment: create necessary directories, load required libraries (GEOquery in R, biopython in Python for potential parsing).
2. [✓] Perform GEO search for Series entries published between 2021-01-01 and 2021-01-15 investigating circular RNA (circRNA) in Homo sapiens.
3. [✓] Extract the GEO Series accession numbers from the search results.
4. [ ] For each Series accession, analyze the entry to determine if it provides accessible human circular RNA expression data derived from human biological sources.
5. [ ] Create a JSON list with objects containing "Series" and "Accepted" fields.
6. [ ] Save the JSON list to the specified output path.

Now step 4: Analyze each Series (GSE163076, GSE164803, GSE164546). We'll write a function to analyze a GSE accession and return True/False.

We'll need to consider:

- Organism: should be Homo sapiens (or samples derived from human biological sources).
- Data type: should be expression profiling (circRNA expression).
- Accessibility: supplementary files or raw data available.
- Circular RNA focus: title/summary mentions circular RNA, and data likely contains circRNA expression.

Let's analyze GSE164803 and GSE164546.

First, GSE164803.

Great! GSE164803 has supplementary files including "CircRNA_Expression_Profiling_Data.xlsx". That is clearly circRNA expression data. Organism is Homo sapiens (sample organism). Accessible via FTP. So Accepted = TRUE.

Now analyze GSE164546.

Great! GSE164546 also appears to provide circRNA expression data (title mentions circRNAs, type is non-coding RNA profiling by array, supplementary raw data available, human samples). Accepted = TRUE.

Now we have analyzed all three Series. Let's also re-analyze GSE163076 with our function to be consistent.

There's an error: `human_organism` might be a vector of length >1. Let's fix the function. We'll ensure we use `any()` or `all()` appropriately. Also, we need to handle cases where `organism` is a vector.

Let's rewrite the function more robustly.

Great! All three Series are accepted. Now step 5: Create JSON list with objects containing "Series" and "Accepted" fields.

We'll create a list in R and write to JSON file.

<execute>
#!R
library(jsonlite)

accs <- c("GSE163076", "GSE164803", "GSE164546")
accepted <- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)

json_list <- lapply(seq_along(accs), function(i) {
    list(Series = accs[i], Accepted = accepted[i])
})

json_string <- toJSON(json_list, auto_unbox = TRUE, pretty = TRUE)
print(json_string)

# Save to file
output_path <- "/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/deepseek-v3.2-fast/circmine_retrieval.json"
write(json_string, output_path)
print(paste("Saved to", output_path))
</execute>
<observation>[
  {
    "Series": "GSE163076",
    "Accepted": true
  },
  {
    "Series": "GSE164803",
    "Accepted": true
  },
  {
    "Series": "GSE164546",
    "Accepted": true
  }
] 
[1] "Saved to /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/deepseek-v3.2-fast/circmine_retrieval.json"
</observation>
Now step 6: Save the JSON list to the specified output path. Already done. Let's verify the file exists and content.

<execute>
import json
import os

output_path = "/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/deepseek-v3.2-fast/circmine_retrieval.json"
with open(output_path, 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
print("File content:")
print(json.dumps(data, indent=2))
print(f"File exists: {os.path.exists(output_path)}")
</execute>
<observation>File content:
[
  {
    "Series": "GSE163076",
    "Accepted": true
  },
  {
    "Series": "GSE164803",
    "Accepted": true
  },
  {
    "Series": "GSE164546",
    "Accepted": true
  }
]
File exists: True
</observation>
Perfect! Now we have completed all steps. Let's update the plan.

1. [✓] Set up the environment: create necessary directories, load required libraries (GEOquery in R, biopython in Python for potential parsing).
2. [✓] Perform GEO search for Series entries published between 2021-01-01 and 2021-01-15 investigating circular RNA (circRNA) in Homo sapiens.
3. [✓] Extract the GEO Series accession numbers from the search results.
4. [✓] For each Series accession, analyze the entry to determine if it provides accessible human circular RNA expression data derived from human biological sources.
5. [✓] Create a JSON list with objects containing "Series" and "Accepted" fields.
6. [✓] Save the JSON list to the specified output path.

All steps completed successfully. Now we can provide the solution.

<solution>
The task is completed. The JSON list containing all Series obtained from the GEO search with their acceptance status has been saved to `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/deepseek-v3.2-fast/circmine_retrieval.json`. The file contains three Series entries, all of which are accepted (`Accepted: true`). The content is as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "Series": "GSE163076",
    "Accepted": true
  },
  {
    "Series": "GSE164803",
    "Accepted": true
  },
  {
    "Series": "GSE164546",
    "Accepted": true
  }
]
```
