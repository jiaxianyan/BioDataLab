Given a pdf content file `benchmark/dataset/CovPDB/pdf_content.md`. 

Determining the covalent bonding mechanisms based on the given paper. 

The mechanisms must be one of: Aziridine Opening; Beta-Lactam Addition; Borylation; Composite Reaction; Cyclohemiaminoacetalization; Disulfide Formation; Epoxide Opening; Hemiaminalization; Hemi(thio)acetalization; Imidazolidinone Opening; Imine Condensation; Lactone Addition; Michael Addition; Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution; Nucleophilic Addition to a Double Bond; Nucleophilic Addition to a Triple Bond; Nucleophilic Aliphatic Subsititution; Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution; Phosphorylation; Ring Opening; Sulfonylation

Saving the mechanisms into `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/deepseek-v3.2-fast/covpdb_annotate.txt`.  

# Output Format (For Reference)
Sulfonylation

# Intermediate Results
All intermediate files generated should be saved in the directly `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/deepseek-v3.2-fast/covpdb_annotate`

ABSTRACT: Golgi mannosidase II (GMII) catalyzes the sequential hydrolysis of two mannosyl residues from  \(\mathrm{GlcNAc}\) \(\mathrm{Man}_5\mathrm{GlcNAc}_2\)  to produce  \(\mathrm{GlcNAcMan}_3\mathrm{GlcNAc}_2,\)  the precursor for all complex  \(N\cdot\)  glycans, including the branched  \(N\cdot\)  glycans associated with cancer. Inhibitors of GMII are potential cancer therapeutics, but their usefulness is limited by off- target effects, which produce  \(\alpha\)  - mannosidosis- like symptoms. Despite many structural and mechanistic studies of GMII, we still lack a potent and selective inhibitor of this enzyme. Here, we synthesized manno- epicyclophellitol epoxide and aziridines and demonstrate their covalent modification and time- dependent inhibition of GMII. Application of fluorescent manno- epi- cyclophellitol aziridine derivatives enabled activity- based protein profiling of  \(\alpha\)  - mannosidases from both human cell lysate and mouse tissue extracts. Synthesized probes also facilitated a fluorescence polarization- based screen for dGMII inhibitors. We identified seven previously unknown inhibitors of GMII from a library of over 350 iminosugars and investigated their binding modalities thr

Golgi  \(\alpha\)  - mannosidase (GMII, MAN2A1, mannosyl- oligosaccharide  \(1,3 / 1,6 - \alpha\)  - mannosidase) is a glycoside hydrolase from CAZy family  \(\mathrm{GH38^1}\)  that catalyzes sequential hydrolysis of both the terminal  \(\alpha - 1,3\cdot\)  and 1,6- linked mannoses from the  \(N\cdot\)  glycan  \(\mathrm{GlcNAcMan}_5\mathrm{GlcNAc}_2\)  Figure 1A), which is a committed step in the formation of complex  \(N\cdot\)  glycans.2 Altered  \(N\cdot\)  glycan branching has been directly linked to the metastatic potential of cells,4 and consequently, inhibitors of GMII are a potential target for anticancer therapeutics. The potent GMII mannosidase inhibitor swainsonine (Figure 1B), first identified in locoweed, has been investigated in this capacity. Swainsonine treatment reduces metastasis and improves outcome in breast, colon, and skin cancers.6- 8 However, swainsonine also produces side effects resembling the lysosomal storage disease  \(\alpha\)  - mannos

Based on biochemical knowledge:
Cyclophellitols are mechanism-based inhibitors of glycosidases.
They mimic the substrate and form a covalent adduct with the catalytic nucleophile.
The epoxide or aziridine ring is opened by nucleophilic attack from the enzyme's active site residue.

Now I need to determine the specific covalent bonding mechanism from the given list. Based on my analysis:

1. The paper describes manno-epi-cyclophellitol epoxide and aziridines as covalent inhibitors.
2. The mechanism involves nucleophilic attack by Asp204 on the pseudoanomeric carbon.
3. This results in ring opening of the aziridine or epoxide.

Looking at the list of possible mechanisms:
- "Aziridine Opening" is mentioned in the paper
- "Epoxide Opening" is mentioned in the paper  
- "Nucleophilic Addition to a Double Bond" could apply (epoxide has a C-O double bond character)
- "Ring Opening" is a general term

However, I need to be more precise. The paper specifically mentions "the opening of the aziridine ring resulting from nucleophilic attack". This suggests "Aziridine Opening" is the most specific mechanism for the aziridine compounds. But the paper also mentions epoxide compounds.

Let me check if there's more specific information about which compound was used for the covalent modification described in the paper.

Checking for 'aziridine opening' mention...
No explicit 'aziridine opening' mention found, but 'opening of the aziridine ring' is described

================================================================================
Final decision:
Mechanism: Aziridine Opening
Reason: The paper's crystal structure shows aziridine 2 covalently bound
        via ring opening, and explicitly describes 'opening of the aziridine ring'
