The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module.

It aims to raise awareness on the environmental impact of tobacco throughout its lifecycle, demonstrating its destructive impact not only on human health, but also on the environment and the planet (1). It also aims to expose efforts of the tobacco industry to \"greenwash\" their reputation and products by increasingly portraying their activities as environmentally friendly (2).\n\nThe campaign messages demonstrate the varied ways that tobacco cultivation, production, distribution, consumption, and post-consumer waste threaten the environment (2). Tobacco destroys forests, harms the soil, affects water supply, pollutes the air, and contributes to other types of unsustainable environmental damage (2).\n\nIn addition to the more than 8 million lives lost to tobacco every year globally (2), this year's campaign reveals the risks tobacco cultivation poses to human health. For example, a tobacco farmer who plants, cultivates, and harvests tobacco may absorb as much nicotine per day as found in 50 cigarettes (3). 'Green Tobacco Sickness' is a form of nicotine poisoning that occurs in about 1 in 4 tobacco farmers (3). Moreover, tobacco farmers may experience increased concentration of aluminum and arsenic in their blood due to exposure to pesticides used in tobacco cultivation (3). Chronic exposure to certain pesticides results in several health effects, including birth defects, benign and malignant tumors, genetic changes, blood disorders, neurological disorders, and endocrine disruption (3).\n\nAt the same time, it is often children who work on tobacco farms, and who are particularly vulnerable, given their low body weight relative to the proportion of nicotine absorbed through their skin from handling tobacco leaves (3). Young tobacco farmers may experience increased risk of early kidney dysfunction and are more likely to smoke (3). Women are disproportionately affected by the harmful effects of tobacco farming because they face a higher risk of infertility and other reproductive issues (3). In other words, the harms of tobacco cultivation threaten everyone, particularly the vulnerable population groups.\n\nIn the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), the tobacco epidemic continues to pose a great challenge to public health. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals challenges Member States to achieving the stipulated  \\(30\\%\\)  reduction in tobacco use by 2030 (4). It is therefore essential to step up tobacco control action through the adoption of evidence-based policies and effective implementation of these policies. Equally important is speaking out and exposing the tobacco industry. Member States can do so at the 27th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, which will convene in November 2022 in Egypt. This is the first time the Region will host this conference, making it an opportune platform for Member States to shed some light on the threat tobacco exacts on human health and the environment.\n\nThe tobacco industry contributes to climate change and reduces climate resilience by wasting resources and damaging ecosystems (5). In fact, the tobacco industry contributes an estimated 84 megatons of carbon dioxide to the annual greenhouse gas and destroys around 3.5 million hectares of land for tobacco growing each year (5).\n\nAlthough largely overlooked in the past, the impact of tobacco on the environment should be of particular importance to Member States in the EMR, given that about  \\(90\\%\\)  of all tobacco production is concentrated in the developing world (6). Tobacco has an immensely uneven impact on different socioeconomic groups (6). In low- and middle-income countries, many farmers and government officials see tobacco as a cash crop that can contribute to economic growth (6). However, the short-term cash benefits of the crop are offset by the long-term consequences of increased food insecurity, frequent sustained farmers' debt, illness and poverty among farm workers, and widespread environmental damage in low- and middle-income countries (6). Many Member States in the EMR grow tobacco and must start transiting to more environmentally friendly and profitable crops such as nuts, chili, green vegetables, and rice (7).\n\nIn line with Article 18 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, Parties agreed to take the needed measures to protect the environment and the health of their people in relation to the environment and\n\nwith respect to tobacco cultivation and manufacturing (8). This is a key obligation under the Convention, making this year an opportune time for countries to step-up national action on this issue by calling on (3):\n\n- Governments and civil society groups to raise awareness on this topic.  \n- Governments to impose an environmental tax levy on tobacco manufacturers, distributors, and consumers for carbon emissions, air pollutants, and other environmental costs caused during the supply chain of tobacco products.  \n- Countries to consider imposing the 'Extended Producer Responsibility Policy Principle' to mitigate the problem of tobacco and e-cigarette product waste, and to hold tobacco and related industries accountable for clean-up and waste disposal costs.\n\n- Countries to recognize the use of single use non-biodegradable plastics in cigarette filters and other nicotine products and to take appropriate action to phase out the use of plastics in nicotine and tobacco products.  \n- Farmers to be supported through government incentives to participate in crop substitution by growing more sustainable crops that will help improve the livelihood of the community.\n\nUsing a comprehensive approach to tackle tobacco is the best way to achieve success in tobacco control and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Protecting the environment from tobacco's destruction is a key component in tackling the tobacco epidemic and should be integrated in all tobacco control programmes at national level (9).\n\n\n=== Content of example_2.md ===\n# Tobacco Couponing: A Systematic Review of Exposures and Effects on Tobacco Initiation and Cessation\n\nAlex C.

We performed a systematic review of the evidence of tobacco product coupon receipt and redemption to inform regulation.\n\nAims and Methods: We searched EMBASE OVID and Medline databases for observational (cross-sectional and longitudinal) studies that examined the prevalence of tobacco coupon receipt and coupon redemption across different subpopulations, as well as studies of the association between coupon receipt and redemption with tobacco initiation and cessation at follow-up. We extracted unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios for the associations between coupon exposure (receipt, redemption) and tobacco use outcomes (initiation, cessation) and assessed each studies' potential risk of bias.\n\nResults: Twenty-seven studies met the criteria for inclusion. Of 60 observations extracted, 37 measured coupon receipt, nine measured coupon redemption, eight assessed tobacco use initiation, and six assessed cessation. Tobacco product coupon receipt and redemption tended to be more prevalent among younger adults, women, lower education individuals, members of sexual and gender minorities, and more freq</observation>"

Polyploidy often leads to an increase in cell or organism size, which may affect transcript abundance or transcriptome size, but the relationship between polyploidy and transcriptome changes remains poorly understood. Plant cells often undergo endoreduplication, confounding the polyploid effect.\n\n</observation>"

The choice of cell types is critical for the scRNA analysis. Many plant cell types often undergo endoreduplication [22], which can confound the polyploid (WGD) effect. After evaluating suitable cell types, we selected reproductive (female gametophytic) cells for the study to minimize confounding variables, and these cells are relatively uniform in a given stage. Flowering plants have three distinct female gametic cells, namely, egg, central, and synergid cells. Each egg or synergid cell is a haploid, whereas the central cell is a diploid (2 copies of the maternal genome). We generated two cell-specific lines that each expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the diploid or isogenic tetraploid A. thaliana (Col-0) using the same construct as previously reported [34, 35]. Specifically, pDD45:nGFP and pSUP16:nGFP are expressed in the egg and central cell nuclei, respectively [34]. The synergid-cell GFP line was available only in the diploid plants and used for diploid comparison but excluded from the diploid-tetraploid analysis.\n44-\n45:Using the nGFP marker, we manually isolated each egg cell from an ovule of flowers (stage 12) under an inverted dissecting microscope (the \"Methods\" section). We named the egg cell in the diploid (ECd) and tetraploid (ECt) plants (Fig. 2a). Similarly, the central cells (CCs) from the diploid and tetraploid plants are designated CCd and CCt, respectively (Fig. 2b). The egg and central cells in the tetraploid plants were  \\(\\sim 1.6\\) -fold (by volume) larger than the corresponding cells in their corresponding diploids (Fig. 2c,\n46-\n--\n87-![](images/ada386347ee0b7c92bb75cb74d3372f7637f8d7ac2f78d619f3722c8ac076021.jpg)  \n88:Fig. 2 Egg and central cell size changes in diploid and tetraploid plants. a, b Representative images of egg cell (EC) (a) and central cell (CC) (b) isolated from the diploid (upper panel) and tetraploid (lower panel) A. thaliana (Col-0). Scale bar = 30  \\(\\mu\\) m. The GFP-labeled nucleus is shown in green. Nuclear (c) and cell (d) size estimates of EC and CC with different ploidy levels using 5 cells for each cell type as in (a) and (b)\n89-\n--\n160-\n161:Remarkably, a group of gene family members encoding cysteine-rich peptides (CRPs) [67], accounted for a large amount of total normalized mRNA transcripts in the egg  \\((15\\%)\\) , central  \\((21\\%)\\) , and synergid  \\((46\\%)\\)  cells (Fig. 5c, d). CRPs regulate plant growth and development through modulation of cell-cell communications, including the guidance of pollen tube and gamete recognition during fertilization [58, 68]. Among these CRP genes (Additional file 4: Table S3), we randomly selected four newly defined genes (two expressed in the synergid cell and two expressed in the central cell) for functional validation by expressing promoter::GFP in the transgenic lines (Fig. 6). Consistent with the scRNA-seq data, two genes (AT5G48953 and AT3G48231) were expressed in the central cell (Fig. 6a, b), according to the image evaluation methods as previously described [34], while the other two (AT4G35165 and AT3G30247) were expressed in the synergid cell (Fig. 6c, d). The data suggest roles of these cell-specifically expressed genes in female-male gametic interactions between synergid cell and pollen tube (sperm) for pollen guidance and between central cell and sperm in double fertilization for endosperm development.\n162-\n--\n175-![](images/ad662763ef235569e3a4482aead1e10e3b9271614f655f7840f92ec919a4e8a4.jpg)  \n176:AT3G48231::GFP  \n177:AT5G48953::GFP\n178-\n--\n185-![](images/56beb89f79c7aeb517997f75db8fe074b913c33b7dff44ebbacb363707cc1a92.jpg)  \n186:AT4G35165::GFP\n187-\n--\n201-Bright field  \n202:Fig. 6 Validation of expression patterns of CRP genes in promoter::GFP transgenic lines.

The same batch of seed stocks was used for this study. Diploid and tetraploid plants were independently transformed with each of the constructs. Transgenic plants (A. thaliana Col-0) showing cell-specific promoter:nGFP of pDD45:nGFP (in egg cell nucleus) [34], pSUP16:nGFP (in central cell nucleus) [35], or pDD31:nGFP (in synergid cell nucleus) [35] were generated in A. thaliana (ecotype Col-0) diploid and isogenic tetraploids [16]. All transgenic plants were grown under the long-day condition (light/dark cycle of  \\(16/8\\mathrm{~h}\\) ) at  \\(22^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}\\) . Flowers at stage 12 were tagged and emasculated, and the emasculated plants were grown for another day. The ovules were dissected from pistils and soaked in a protoplast enzyme solution (2% cellulose, 0.3% macerozyme R-10, 0.05% pectolyase, and 0.45 M mannitol) for  \\(15\\mathrm{~min}\\)  as previously described [77]. Individual egg, central, or synergid cells labeled independently by nucleus-localized GFP were carefully isolated from different plants in various times and captured into a microtube using a microcapillary pipette that is installed in a micromanipulator (MN-151, NARISHIGE) and a micro-injector (IM-11-2, NARISHIGE) under an inverted dissecting microscope (Eclipse Ts2R, Nikon).\n225-\n--\n273-\n274:Genomic DNA from Arabidopsis (Col-0) was used to amplify promoter regions of AT3G4823, AT5G48953, AT4G35165, and AT3G30247.

All constructs were individually cloned into Agrobacterium strain GV3101 and then transformed into diploid Arabidopsis (Col-0) using the standard floral dip method [83]. GFP activity within the mature female gametophyte was captured 1 day after emasculation using Zeiss Axiovert 200M fluorescence microscope.\n275-\n--\n287-\n288:Additional file 5: Table S4.
