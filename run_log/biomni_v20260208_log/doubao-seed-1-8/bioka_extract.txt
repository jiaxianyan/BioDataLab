## ABSTRACT

Clinical evidence shows that following initial response to treatment, drug-resistant cancer cells frequently evolve and, eventually, most tumors become resistant to all available therapies. We compiled a focused library consisting of  \(>500\)  commercially available or newly synthesized 8-hydroxyquinoline (8OHQ) derivatives whose toxicity is paradoxically increased rather than decreased by the activity of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a transporter conferring multidrug resistance (MDR). Here, we deciphered the mechanism of action of NSC297366 that shows exceptionally strong Pgp-potentiated toxicity. Treatment of cells with NSC297366 resulted in changes associated with the activity of potent anticancer iron chelators.

## Introduction

Clinical evidence shows that, following initial response to treatment, drug-resistant cancer cells frequently evolve, and eventually most tumors become resistant to all available therapies (1). Cancer cells can escape treatment by various mechanisms. The most straightforward cause of therapy resistance is linked to cellular alterations that prevent drugs to act on their target. For example, therapies hitting cancer-specific pathways are often blunted by mutations altering the target or by the activation of compensatory pathways. Alternatively, cell-intrinsic resistance mechanisms can change the "cellular pharmacology" of the cancer cell, influencing the uptake, metabolism or the

Strikingly, iron depletion was more pronounced in MDR cells due to the Pgp-mediated efflux of NSC297366-iron complexes. Our results indicate that iron homeostasis can be targeted by MDR-selective compounds for the selective elimination of multidrug resistant cancer cells, setting the stage for a therapeutic approach to fight transporter-mediated drug resistance.

Significance: Modulation of the MDR phenotype has the potential to increase the efficacy of anticancer therapies. These findings show that the MDR transporter is a "double-edged sword" that can be turned against resistant cancer.

efflux of the drugs to reduce their concentrations below a cell-killing threshold (1, 2). Upregulation of cell membrane efflux transporters of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily leads to simultaneous resistance against structurally and functionally unrelated chemotherapeutic agents. In particular, P-glycoprotein (Pgp, MDR1), the product of ABCB1 gene, was shown to be expressed in several drug resistant malignancies, including ovarian carcinoma (3), acute myeloid leukemia (4), chronic myeloid leukemia (5), small cell lung cancer (6), and more (1, 2).

On the basis of the correlation of P-glycoprotein expression and function (7) with unfavorable treatment response, it is universally accepted that pharmacologic modulation of the multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype has the potential to significantly increase the efficacy of currently available anticancer therapies. Unfortunately, despite a few early successes, clinical trials conducted with Pgp inhibitors did not fulfill this expectation, failing to confirm clinical benefit (8). Failure of the trials led to a setback in research, and the shutdown of the pharmaceutical development of transporter inhibitors for the improvement of anticancer therapy. Yet the "transporter problem" has not vanished, as evidenced by new studies supporting the relevance and benefit of research on the role of ABC transporters in clinical drug resistance (2). For example, studies conducted with genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) mirroring many aspects of the human disease have shown that acquired resistance to docetaxel, doxorubicin, topotecan or olaparib is caused by the increased expression of the Abcb1 or Abcg2 genes, and the contribution of drug efflux to drug resistance was also confirmed in ABC transporter-deficient tumors (9).

Failure of the inhibitors has boosted research in other directions, exploring the possibility to evade efflux, or to exploit the paradoxical sensitivity associated with efflux-based drug resistance mechanisms (1). Alterations that confer selective advantage during the evolution of cancer cells might also create vulnerabilities that can be exploited therapeutically (10, 11). From this perspective, resistance can be interpreted as a trait that could be targeted by new drugs. In recent

years we have undertaken a systematic effort to identify "MDR-selective" compounds exhibiting increased, rather than decreased toxicity against MDR cells. Our method, based on the correlation of toxicity profiles with Pgp expression patterns in the NCI60 cell panel, has led to the discovery of several compounds with robust, Pgp dependent toxic activity across diverse cell lines (12-15).

To date, the mechanism of Pgp potentiated toxicity of the MDR-selective compounds is not known, limiting intelligent drug design. Strikingly, MDR-selective compounds show structural coherence, highlighting chemical features that may be responsible for a common mechanism of action. In particular, there is a significant enrichment of metal chelators, indicating that metal-ion interaction could be key to the cytotoxicity of MDR-selective compounds (16, 17).

Here, we describe the relation of iron chelation to the MDR-selective toxicity of NSC297366, a compound containing an 8-hydroxyquinoline substructure possessing exceptionally strong Pgp-potentiated toxicity. We show that the toxicity of NSC297366 is linked to cellular iron depletion, which is exacerbated by Pgp.

53:MES-SA, MES-SA/DX5 cells were obtained from ATCC where they were characterized by DNA fingerprinting. The ABCB1-overexpressing subline MES-SA/B1 was produced by lentiviral transduction of pRRL-EF1-ABCB1. MES-SA mCherry and MES-SA/B1 mOrange cell lines were engineered to overexpress the fluorescent protein with lentiviral transduction of pRRL-EF1 plasmids. P-glycoprotein function was characterized by the Calcein AM assay (Supplementary Fig. S2; ref. 7). Cells were periodically tested and resulted negative for Mycoplasma contamination with the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Lonza). Cells were cultured for not more than 30 passages or 3 months after thawing. Cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with  \(10\%\)  fetal bovine serum (Gibco),  \(5\mathrm{mmol / L}\)  L-glutamine (Gibco), and  \(50~\mathrm{U / mL}\)  penicillin/streptomycin solution (Life Technologies).

In each well, 2,500 cells were seeded in 20  \(\mu\) L medium, 1 day prior to the addition of the 2 compounds to be combined in additional  \(20 + 20~\mu \mathrm{L}\)  volumes. Fully automated pipetting steps were performed by a Hamilton StarLet liquid handling workstation. Plates were incubated for 6 days. Growth inhibition (GI) of MES-SA mCherry and MES-SA/B1 mOrange lines was assessed based on the detection of the respective fluorescent intensities scanned from the wells (585ex/610em for mCherry and 545ex/567em for mOrange).

For each data point of the isobole, significance was calculated as the combination index (CI; ref. 18). Drug combinations were considered additive at  \(0.85 \leq \mathrm{CI} \leq 1.2\) ; moderate and strong synergism was defined as  \(\mathrm{CI} < 0.85\)  and  \(\mathrm{CI} < 0.7\) , respectively; moderate and strong antagonism was defined as  \(\mathrm{CI} > 1.2\)  and  \(\mathrm{CI} > 1.45\) , respectively.

105:pounds, we compiled a focused library consisting of  \(>500\)  commercially available or newly synthesized 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives and screened the compounds using the parental MES-SA and the multidrug resistant MES-SA/DX5 cell lines. This screening effort has confirmed the relevance of the 8-hydroxyquinoline backbone in MDR-selective toxicity, and the requirement of functional Pgp to mediate sensitization of MDR cells (Fig. 1A). NSC297366, in which the 8OHQ substructure is embedded into a ring is one of the highly active derivatives, and thus was chosen to characterize the mechanism of action of MDR-selective toxicity (results obtained with 4 additional MDR-selective 8OHQ derivatives are shown in Supplementary Table S1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). To explore the specific contribution and the functional relevance of P-glycoprotein in collateral sensitivity to NSC297366, we generated MES-SA/B1 cells by lentiviral transduction of MES-SA cells with an expression vector encoding human MDR1 cDNA. Using this isogenic cell line pair, we confirmed that the moderate expression of P-glycoprotein in MES-SA/B1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A-S2C) is sufficient to confer resistance to doxorubicin as well as increased sensitivity to NSC297366 (Fig. 1B). Both phenotypes were fully reversed by the specific Pgp inhibitor tariquidar, showing the reliance of collateral sensitivity on P-glycoprotein function. Notably, MDR-selective toxicity was not restricted to MES-SA/B1 cells. NSC297366 proved to preferentially target several further MDR cell lines with variable Pgp expression and different tissue of origin (Supplementary Table S2), whereas overexpression of ABCG2 did not sensitize cells (Supplementary Fig. S3A-S3B). To expand the scope of the in vitro models to cells expressing low Pgp levels, NSC297366 was assayed in sorted MES-SA/B1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4), an independent MES-SA/B1 cell line transfected with lower viral titers (MES-SA/B1 M50) and the KB epidermoid carcinoma series selected from KB-3-1 cells in increasing concentrations of colchicine (KB-8, KB-8-5, KB-8-5-11; ref. 23). These results confirmed that paradoxical hypersensitivity of MDR cells is proportional to Pgp levels, pertaining to cells expressing clinically relevant levels of Pgp (Supplementary Fig. S5). Selectivity was abrogated by functional inhibition of Pgp, indicating that Pgp is both necessary and sufficient to convey sensitivity to this compound.
122:Pgp-potentiated cytotoxicity of the 8OHQ derivatives in multidrug resistant cancer cell lines. A, Data points represent average  \(\mathsf{pIC}_{50}\)  values of 8OHQ derivatives against Pgp-negative MES-SA (x-axis) and Pgp expressing MES-SA/DX5 (y-axis) cells in absence (purple; 471 compounds) or presence (green; 252 compounds) of  \(1\mu \mathrm{mol} / \mathrm{L}\)  tariquidar. Compounds displaying at least a twofold difference in toxicity are either MDR-selective (above the top dashed line) or Pgp substrates (below the bottom dashed line). The compounds represent a focused library built around the 8OHQ scaffold, containing many inactive compounds (scattered around the axis representing equal toxicity), such as the parental compound 8OHQ (blue). Whereas MES-SA/DX5 cells are resistant to doxorubicin (red), they are hypersensitive against several 8OHQ derivatives, including NSC297366 (pink). The contribution of P-glycoprotein to drug resistance or collateral sensitivity is abolished in the presence of tariquidar (green data points). Dashed and straight lines point to  \(\mathsf{pIC}_{50}\)  values measured in absence or the presence of tariquidar, respectively. Error bars, SD of at least three independent experiments. B, P-glycoprotein is a double-edged sword. As compared to parental MES-SA cells (green), Pgp expression in MES-SA/DX5 (red) or MES-SA/B1 (orange) cells confers resistance to doxorubicin (left), but also sensitivity to NSC297366 (right); both are abrogated by the specific Pgp inhibitor tariquidar (dashed lines).
157:described target of anticancer chelators, RNR catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleoside diphosphates (NDP) to deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates (dNDP) that are subsequently converted into deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTP; ref. 27). Treatment with the established RNR inhibitor hydroxyurea lead to an imbalance of the dNTP pools, resulting in the significant decrease of dATP levels in both cell lines (28). In contrast, treatment with NSC297366 did not affect MES-SA cells, but induced a selective depletion of dATP levels in MES-SA/B1 cells (Fig. 5A; further dNTPs are sown in Supplementary Fig. S8A-S8C; baseline RNR levels are shown in Supplementary Fig. S9). Consistent with the inhibition of RNR activity, NSC297366 caused a P-glycoprotein dependent increase of cell cycle suppressing proteins p53, p21 \(^{\text{Cip/Waf1}}\)  and p27 \(^{\text{Kip1}}\) , along with a moderate decrease in cyclin D3 (CCND3) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) levels 24 hours after the treatment (Fig. 5B), which lead to a  \(\mathrm{G}_1 - \mathrm{S}\)  arrest marked by the dramatic decrease of G2 phase (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Fig. S10) and eventually the selective induction of apoptosis in MES-SA/B1 cells (Fig. 5D; Supplementary Fig. S11A and S11B). Addition of tar-liquidar rescued MES-SA/B1 cells from cell cycle arrest and
190:There exists an unmet medical need for developing targeted and efficient anticancer drugs acting against drug resistant tumors expressing ABCB1/Pgp. Our prior work has identified several compounds whose toxicity is increased, rather than decreased by the activity of P-glycoprotein. We have shown that the function of Pgp is both necessary and sufficient to induce collateral sensitivity in MDR cells. That Pgp is necessary was evidenced by the loss of collateral sensitivity in the presence of specific efflux inhibitors; that Pgp is sufficient was demonstrated by the persistent MDR-selective toxicity of the compounds across diverse MDR cell lines (Supplementary Table S2; Supplementary Fig. S5) (14). However, the mechanism of action of MDR-selective compounds targeting</observation>
