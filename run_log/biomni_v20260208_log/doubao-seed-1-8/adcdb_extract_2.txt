# Core Task
Conduct a comprehensive PubMed literature search to identify original English research articles investigating the biological activity of Zilovertamab vedotin. The search query should combine drug-specific keywords—Zilovertamab vedotin (MK-2140/VLS-101)—with biological activity terms (such as pharmacology, mechanism of action, efficacy, and ADC), restricted to the title and abstract fields.  For each retrieved article, analyze its abstract to determine if it investigates the biological activity of the drug.

# Output Requirements & File Path
- Output format: JSON list of objects. The list must include all articles obtained from the initial PubMed search.
- Each object must contain exactly two fields:
  - `"PMID"`: PubMed ID as a string
  - `"Accepted"`: Boolean value (`true` if the article meets the biological activity investigation criteria, `false` otherwise)
- Save Path: Save the complete list to: `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/doubao-seed-1-8/adcdb_extract_2.json`
- Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/doubao-seed-1-8/adcdb_extract/`
