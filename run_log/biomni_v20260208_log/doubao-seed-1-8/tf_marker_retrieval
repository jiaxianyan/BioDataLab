The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\nImport file: assistant.tool_biodatalab.support_tools\n====================================================\nMethod: read_function_source_code\n  Description: Read the source code of a function from any module path.\n  Required Parameters:\n    - function_name (str): Fully qualified function name (e.g., 'bioagentos.tool.support_tools.write_python_code') [Default: None]\n\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module.

Based on existing in vitro studies, this research aims to \\ninvestigate the role of mesenchymal stem cells in the EMT of HNSCC and its \\nrelated mechanisms.\\nMETHODS: According to the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, \\nEmbase, and Web of Science databases for relevant in vitro studies up to May 6, \\n2024. Two trained researchers independently performed literature screening, data \\nextraction, and quality assessment, with cross-checking of results. Any \\ndisagreements were resolved through discussion or by consulting a third party. \\nMeta-analysis was conducted using Stata 17 software.\\nRESULTS: A total of 8 in vitro studies were included, involving OSCC, NPC, and \\nTSCC. The meta-analysis results indicate that MSC intervention may be associated \\nwith a reduction in the expression of epithelial markers and an increase in \\nmesenchymal markers and related transcription factors in cancer cells, implying \\na potential role for MSCs in promoting EMT in vitro. Furthermore, a preliminary \\nreview of the underlying molecular mechanisms suggests that this process may \\ninvolve the potential regulation of multiple signaling pathways, including \\nNF-\\u03baB, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, IL-6R/JAK/STAT3, CXCL8/CXCR2, TGF-\\u03b2/Smad, and FGF19-FGFR4.\\nCONCLUSIONS: The existing in vitro evidence suggests that mesenchymal stem cells \\nmay exhibit a potential to promote EMT in HNSCC, potentially regulating tumor \\nprogression through multiple signaling pathway networks and providing new \\npotential targets for future therapies targeting the TME.

To understand the genome-wide transcriptomic landscape, we \\nperformed a meta-analysis from studies reporting gene expression patterns in \\natrial heart tissue from patients with AF and controls in sinus rhythm (SR).\\nMETHODS: Bibliographic databases and data repositories were systematically \\nsearched for studies reporting gene expression patterns in atrial heart auricle \\ntissue from patients with AF and controls in sinus rhythm. We calculated the \\npooled differences in individual gene expression from fourteen studies \\ncomprising 534 samples (353 AF and 181 SR) to create a consensus signature (CS), \\nfrom which we identified differentially regulated pathways, estimated \\ntranscription factor activity, and evaluated its performance in classifying \\nvalidation samples as AF or SR.\\nRESULTS: Despite heterogeneity in the top differentially expressed genes across \\nstudies, the AF-CS in both chambers were robust, showing a better performance in \\nclassifying AF status than individual study signatures. Functional analysis \\nrevealed commonality in the dysregulated cellular processes between chambers, \\nincluding extracellular matrix remodeling (highlighting epithelial mesenchymal \\ntransition, actin filament organization, and actin binding hallmark pathways), \\ncardiac conduction (including cardiac muscle cell action potential, gated \\nchannel activity, and cation channel activity pathways), metabolic derangements \\n(highlighting oxidative phosphorylation and asparagine n linked glycosylation), \\nand innate immune system activity (mainly neutrophil degranulation, and TNF\\u03b1 \\nsignaling pathways). Finally, the AF-CS showed a good performance \\ndifferentiating AF from controls in three validation datasets (two from \\nperipheral blood and one from left ventricle samples).\\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite variability in individual studies, this meta-analysis \\nelucidated conserved molecular pathways involved in AF pathophysiology across \\nits phenotypes and the potential of a transcriptomic signature in identifying AF \\nfrom peripheral blood samples. Our work highlights the value of integrating \\npublished transcriptomics data in AF and the need for better data deposition \\npractices.\\n\\nCopyright: \\u00a9 2025 G\\u00f3mez-Ochoa et al.

Based on existing in vitro studies, this research aims to \\ninvestigate the role of mesenchymal stem cells in the EMT of HNSCC and its \\nrelated mechanisms.\\nMETHODS: According to the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, \\nEmbase, and Web of Science databases for relevant in vitro studies up to May 6, \\n2024. Two trained researchers independently performed literature screening, data \\nextraction, and quality assessment, with cross-checking of results. Any \\ndisagreements were resolved through discussion or by consulting a third party. \\nMeta-analysis was conducted using Stata 17 software.\\nRESULTS: A total of 8 in vitro studies were included, involving OSCC, NPC, and \\nTSCC. The meta-analysis results indicate that MSC intervention may be associated \\nwith a reduction in the expression of epithelial markers and an increase in \\nmesenchymal markers and related transcription factors in cancer cells, implying \\na potential role for MSCs in promoting EMT in vitro. Furthermore, a preliminary \\nreview of the underlying molecular mechanisms suggests that this process may \\ninvolve the potential regulation of multiple signaling pathways, including \\nNF-\\u03baB, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, IL-6R/JAK/STAT3, CXCL8/CXCR2, TGF-\\u03b2/Smad, and FGF19-FGFR4.\\nCONCLUSIONS: The existing in vitro evidence suggests that mesenchymal stem cells \\nmay exhibit a potential to promote EMT in HNSCC, potentially regulating tumor \\nprogression through multiple signaling pathway networks and providing new \\npotential targets for future therapies targeting the TME. However, more \\nhigh-quality, standardized in vivo and in vitro studies are needed to further \\nvalidate the related mechanisms and therapeutic potential.\\n\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2026 Wang, Liu, Du, Xue, Ruan, Yu, Ma and Li.\\n\\nDOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2025.1705852\\nPMCID: PMC12862828\\nPMID: 41635849 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\\n\\nConflict of interest statement: The authors declared that this work was \\nconducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could \\nbe construed as a potential conflict of interest.\"\n}\n</observation>"
