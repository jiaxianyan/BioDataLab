The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module. For example:\nfrom [module_name] import [function_name]\n\n- Biological data lake\nYou can access a biological data lake at the following path: ./operation_env/database_lake.\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant datasets:\nEach item is listed with its description to help you understand its contents.\n----\n\n----\n\n- Software Library:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant libraries that you can use:\nEach library is listed with its description to help you understand its functionality.\n----\nlangchain: [Python Package] Building applications with LLMs through composability.\ntransformers:\n  [Python Package] State-of-the-art Machine Learning for Pytorch, TensorFlow, and\n  JAX.\nscikit-learn: [Python Package] Simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.\nopenai: [Python Package] The OpenAI Python library.\nanthropic: [Python Package] The Anthropic Python library.\ngoogle-genai: [Python Package] Google Generative AI SDK.\ntidyverse:\n  [R Package] A collection of R packages designed for data science (ggplot2,\n  dplyr, tidyr, readr, etc.).\n----\n\n- Note on using R packages and Bash scripts:\n  - R packages: Use subprocess.run(['Rscript', '-e', 'your R code here']) in Python, or use the #!R marker in your execute block.\n  - Bash scripts and commands: Use the #!BASH marker in your execute block for both simple commands and complex shell scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, etc.\n        "

Laminin-5 is thought to be involved in cell adhesion via integrin alpha-3/beta-1 in focal adhesion and integrin alpha-6/beta-4 in hemidesmosomes, signal transduction via tyrosine phosphorylation of pp125-FAK and p80, differentiation of keratinocytes.\nB36BFV\tIL2 mRNA\tIL2\tInterleukin-2 mRNA; IL-2 mRNA; T-cell growth factor mRNA; TCGF mRNA\tmRNA\tCytokine produced by activated CD4-positive helper T-cells and to a lesser extend activated CD8-positive T-cells and natural killer cells that plays pivotal roles in the immune response and tolerance. Binds to a receptor complex composed of either the high-affinity trimeric IL-2R or the low-affinity dimeric IL-2R. Interaction with the receptor leads to oligomerization and conformation changes in the IL-2R subunits resulting in downstream signaling starting with phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK3. In turn, JAK1 and JAK3 phosphorylate the receptor to form a docking site leading to the phosphorylation of several substrates including STAT5. This process leads to activation of several pathways including STAT, phosphoinositide-3-kinase/PI3K and mitogen-activated protein kinase/MAPK pathways. Functions as a T-cell growth factor and can increase NK-cell cytolytic activity as well. Promotes strong proliferation of activated B-cells and subsequently immunoglobulin production. Plays a pivotal role in regulating the adaptive immune system by controlling the survival and proliferation of regulatory T-cells, which are required for the maintenance of immune tolerance. Moreover, participates in the differentiation and homeostasis of effector T-cell subsets, including Th1, Th2, Th17 as well as memory CD8-positive T-cells.\nB12RGS\tClusterin\tCLU; APOJ; CLI; KUB1; AAG4\tKu70-binding protein 1; KUB1; Complement-associated protein SP-40,40; Complement cytolysis inhibitor; CLI; Apolipoprotein J; ApoJ; Apo-J ; Aging-associated gene 4 protein; AAG4\tProtein\tFunctions as extracellular chaperone that prevents aggregation of non native proteins. Prevents stress-induced aggregation of blood plasma proteins. Inhibits formation of amyloid fibrils by APP, APOC2, B2M, CALCA, CSN3, SNCA and aggregation-prone LYZ variants. Does not require ATP. Maintains partially unfolded proteins in a state appropriate for subsequent refolding by other chaperones, such as HSPA8/HSC70. Does not refold proteins by itself. Binding to cell surface receptors triggers internalization of the chaperone-client complex and subsequent lysosomal or proteasomal degradation. Protects cells against apoptosis and against cytolysis by complement. Intracellular forms interact with ubiquitin and SCF E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes and promote the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of target proteins. Promotes proteasomal degradation of COMMD1 and IKBKB. Modulates NF-kappa-B transcriptional activity. A mitochondrial form suppresses BAX-dependent release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm and inhibit apoptosis. Plays a role in the regulation of cell proliferation. An intracellular form suppresses stress-induced apoptosis by stabilizing mitochondrial membrane integrity through interaction with HSPA5. Secreted form does not affect caspase or BAX-mediated intrinsic apoptosis and TNF-induced NF-kappa-B-activity. Secreted form act as an important modulator during neuronal differentiation through interaction with STMN3. Plays a role in the clearance of immune complexes that arise during cell injury. Does not affect caspase or BAX-mediated intrinsic apoptosis and TNF-induced NF-kappa-B-activity. Does not affect caspase or BAX-mediated intrinsic apoptosis and TNF-induced NF-kappa-B-activity. Promotes cell death through interaction with BCL2L1 that releases and activates BAX.\nB1W4DT\tUrokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor\tPLAUR; MO3; UPAR\tUrokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor; Urokinase plasminogen activator receptor; Monocyte activation antigenMo3; CD87 antigen; CD87\tProtein\tActs as a receptor for urokinase plasminogen activator. Plays a role in localizing and promoting plasmin formation. Mediates the proteolysis-independent signal transduction activation effects of U-PA. It is subject to negative-feedback regulation by U-PA which cleaves it into an inactive form.\n</observation>"
