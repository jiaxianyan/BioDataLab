The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module.

Thomas Bock2,4*\nAbstract\nBackground: Coinfections of HIV-positive individuals with Hepatitis B and D virus (HBV and HDV) are common and\ncan be associated with rapid liver damage. Several antiretroviral drugs for HIV exhibit anti-HBV effect; however, the\nselection of HBV drug resistance mutations (DRMs) in individuals under HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been\nreported but rarely in Nigeria. In this study the HBV/HDV prevalence and HBV DRMs in HIV-positive individuals in\nSouthwestern Nigeria were assessed.\nMethods: Plasma samples collected from 310 HIV-positive individuals including 295 ART-experienced and 15 ART-\nna\u00efve persons attending the HIV clinic in three south-western states of Nigeria between June 2017 and August 2017\nwere analysed by ELISA for HBsAg and anti-HDV. The presence of HDV RNA and HBV DNA was analysed by (RT)-PCR\nfollowed by sequencing and phylogenetic analyses for genotyping. The HBV reverse transcription (RT) region was\namplified and sequenced for the analysis of drug resistance mutations.\nResults: Overall, 16.1% (n 50/310) of the HIV-positive individuals were positive for HBsAg, most of which were ART-\n=\nexperienced (94.0%; n 47/50). From the 50 HBsAg-positive samples, 72.0% (n 36/50) were positive for HBV DNA\n= =\nand 16.0% (n 8/50) had detectable HDV RNA while 5.6% (n 2/36) of the HBV-DNA positive samples had anti-HDV\n= =\ntotal antibodies. Sequences were available for 31/36 of the HBV DNA-positive and 3/8 HDV RNA-positive samples.\nHBV DNA-positive samples were characterised as HBV genotype E infections exclusively, while HDV genotype 1 was\ndetected in the HDV RNA-positive samples. HBV DRMs V173L, L180M, S202I and M204V/I, which are associated with\nlamivudine resistance, were detected in 32.2% (n 10/31) of the HBV DNA-positive samples. Most of these mutations\n=\n(90.0%; n 9/10) were present in the ART-experienced cohort.\n=\nConclusions: This study indicates that HBV/HDV coinfections are common in HIV-positive individuals under ART in\nNigeria. Furthermore, a high proportion of HBV DRMs which potentially compromise future treatment options were\ndetected, underscoring the need for HBV screening prior to starting ART. Further studies should be performed to\nmonitor a possible increase in the spread of HDV among populations at risk of HIV and HBV infections.\n*Correspondence: bockc@rki.de\n\u2020Oluyinka Oladele Opaleye and Olusola Anuoluwapo Akanbi contributed\nequally to the work and thus shared first authorship\n2 Division of Viral Gastroenteritis and Hepatitis Pathogens\nand Enteroviruses, Department of Infectious Diseases, Robert Koch\nInstitute, Berlin, Germany\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2021.
