Process quality control and genomic mapping of the the raw sequencing data located at `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/rna_seq/SRR942022_1.fastq`.

Using fastp with default parameters.

The reference genome located at `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/ref/TAIR10_chr_all.fas`.

Converting the alignment output into BAM format and perform coordinate-based sorting.

Saving the final bam file in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/doubao-seed-1-8/asmdb_refinement_2.bam`

All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/doubao-seed-1-8/asmdb_refinement_2/`

<solution>
The quality control and genomic mapping process has been successfully completed:

1. **Quality Control**: Raw sequencing data was processed using fastp with default parameters, generating cleaned reads at `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/doubao-seed-1-8/asmdb_refinement_2/cleaned_SRR942022_1.fastq` along with QC reports.

2. **Genomic Alignment**: Cleaned reads were aligned to the TAIR10 reference genome using HISAT2, producing a SAM alignment file.

3. **BAM Conversion & Sorting**: The SAM file was converted to coordinate-sorted BAM format using samtools sort, resulting in the final output file:
   `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/doubao-seed-1-8/asmdb_refinement_2.bam`

4. **Indexing**: The final BAM file was indexed for efficient downstream analysis, with the index file located at:
   `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/doubao-seed-1-8/asmdb_refinement_2.bam.bai`

All intermediate files (cleaned reads, SAM file, QC reports) are stored in the temporary directory:
`/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/doubao-seed-1-8/asmdb_refinement_2/`
