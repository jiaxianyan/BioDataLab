The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module. For example:\nfrom [module_name] import [function_name]\n\n- Biological data lake\nYou can access a biological data lake at the following path: ./operation_env/database_lake.\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant datasets:\nEach item is listed with its description to help you understand its contents.\n----\n\n----\n\n- Software Library:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant libraries that you can use:\nEach library is listed with its description to help you understand its functionality.\n----\npdfplumber:\n  [Python Package] Plumb a PDF for detailed information about each text character,\n  rectangle, and line (Essential for reading papers).\npytesseract:\n  [Python Package] Python-tesseract is an optical character recognition (OCR) tool\n  for python.\npillow:\n  [Python Package] The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities\n  to your Python interpreter.\nbiopython: [Python Package] A set of freely available tools for biological computation.\nlangchain: [Python Package] Building applications with LLMs through composability.\ntransformers:\n  [Python Package] State-of-the-art Machine Learning for Pytorch, TensorFlow, and\n  JAX.\nopenai: [Python Package] The OpenAI Python library.\nanthropic: [Python Package] The Anthropic Python library.\ngoogle-genai: [Python Package] Google Generative AI SDK.\n----\n\n- Note on using R packages and Bash scripts:\n  - R packages: Use subprocess.run(['Rscript', '-e', 'your R code here']) in Python, or use the #!R marker in your execute block.\n  - Bash scripts and commands: Use the #!BASH marker in your execute block for both simple commands and complex shell scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, etc.\n        "

Your core competency is the high-fidelity extraction of experimental data from scientific literature regarding the site-specific incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs). You will process specific PDF publications to curate a structured dataset of orthogonal translation systems (aaRS/tRNA pairs), their origins, and their applications in protein engineering.\n\n# Workflow Instructions\n- `Literature Processing`: Parse the provided PDF files located at the specified path.\n- `Data Extraction & Formatting`:\n  1) ncAA Identifiers: Extract abbreviations and full names. Use \"not available\" if missing.\n  2) aaRS ID Construction: Follow the syntax [Org Abbr]-[Natural Substrate]RS ([Mutations/Wild Type]). (e.g., Ec-MetRS (wild type) or Mb-PylRS (Y271C, N311Q, Y349F, V366C)).\n  3) tRNA ID Construction: Follow the syntax [Org Abbr]-tRNA [Natural AA] [Anticodon]. (e.g., Bs-tRNA Tyr CUA). Each tRNA has a name composed of three words: (a) abbreviation of the organism from which it was derived; (b) tRNA; (c) AA naturally transported by the tRNA; (d) anticodon. For example, 'Bs-tRNA Tyr CUA' indicates a tRNA naturally found in Bacillus subtilis, which transports tyrosine, whose anticodon is CUA. \n  4) Organism Mapping: Identify full scientific names for both aaRS and tRNA origins.\n  5) Protein Application: Identify the target protein. Critical: If multiple proteins are tested in one paper, create a unique row for each protein.\n  6) Site Mapping: If multiple independent sites are tested, separate with ; and sort by residue number (ascending). If multiple sites are incorporated simultaneously (jointly), use +.\n  7) Host System: Identify the test organism or specify \"in vitro\".\n\n# Input File Path\nInput Path: `benchmark/dataset/iNClusive/` (Files: paper_data_17_21.pdf, paper_data_947.pdf, paper_data_966_1011.pdf, paper_data_1748.pdf, paper_data_2126_2127.pdf)\n\n# Output Requirements & File Path\nGenerate a CSV file using a semicolon (;) as the delimiter for each input PDF file. \nOutput Path: /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/doubao-seed-1-8/inclusive_extract_1/\nNaming Convention: Output filenames must match the input PDF filename (e.g., paper_data_17_21.pdf results in paper_data_17_21.csv).\nThe CSV must contain the following columns exactly as named:\n  \"ncAA abbreviation(s) used in the publication\"\n  \"ncAA name, as mentioned in the publication\"\n  \"aaRS ID (abbr. organism, abbr. natural substrate, RS, mutations if any)\"\n  \"aaRS origin organism full name\"\n  \"tRNA ID (abbr. organism, tRNA, natural AA transported, anticodon)\"\n  \"tRNA organism\"\n  \"Tested in (protein)\"\n  \"Tested in (protein position)\"\n  \"Tested in (organism/in vitro)\"\n\n# Output Example (For Reference Only)\nncAA abbreviation(s) used in the publication;ncAA name, as mentioned in the publication;aaRS ID (abbr. organism, abbr. natural substrate, RS, mutations if any);aaRS origin organism full name;tRNA ID (abbr. organism, tRNA, natural AA transported, anticodon);tRNA organism;Tested in (protein);Tested in (protein position);Tested in (organism/in vitro)\nnot available;p-acetyl-L-phenylalanine;Ec-TyrRS (mutant);Escherichia coli;Ec-tRNA Tyr CUA;Escherichia coli;human superoxide dismutase 1 (hSOD);33;Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n\n# Intermediate Results\nAll intermediate files generated should be saved in the directly `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/doubao-seed-1-8/inclusive_extract_1`\n"

This was made possible by first functionally replacing this endogenous pair with an\nE. coli\u2013optimized counterpart from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and then reintroducing the liberated E. coli TrpRS\u2013tRNATrp pair into\nthe resulting strain as a nonsense suppressor, which was then followed by its directed evolution to genetically encode several\nnew unnatural amino acid\ns (UAAs). These engineered TrpRS\u2013tRNATrp variants were also able to drive efficient UAA mutagen-\nesis in mammalian cells. Since bacteria-derived aminoacyl\u2013tRNA synthetase (aaRS)\u2013tRNA pairs are typically orthogonal in\neukaryotes, our work provides a general strategy to develop additional aaRS\u2013tRNA pairs that can be used for UAA mutagenesis\nof proteins expressed in both E. coli and eukaryotes.\nThe ability to site-specifically incorporate unnatural amino acid\ns over the last 6 years have taken advantage of the pyrrolysyl system\n(UAAs) into a protein in living cells has emerged as a powerful (Supplementary Fig. 1b).\nmethod to probe and manipulate its structure and function1\u20133. Here we report a novel strategy to circumvent these limitations\nCentral to this technology is an engineered aminoacyl\u2013tRNA by taking advantage of an E. coli strain in which one of the native\nsynthetase (aaRS)\u2013tRNA pair that delivers a desired UAA in response aaRS\u2013tRNA pairs is functionally replaced with a eukaryotic\u2013archaeal\nto a nonsense or frameshift codon.

Thus, genetic code expansion of bacte- pairs that share the unique advantages of the pyrrolysyl system but\nria relies upon aaRS\u2013tRNA pairs derived from eukaryotes or archaea, provide access to new active site topologies for genetically encod-\nwhile in eukaryotes such expansion generally utilizes bacterial ing UAAs inaccessible to PylRS. The development of multiple such\npairs (archaeal aaRS\u2013tRNA pairs are typically cross-reactive with their aaRS\u2013tRNA pairs\u2014each capable of incorporating a rich set of\neukaryotic counterparts). The use of two distinct sets of aaRS\u2013tRNA UAAs\u2014will also facilitate site-specific incorporation of multiple\npairs for genetic code expansion in eukaryotes and bacteria leads to distinct UAAs into proteins in both eukaryotes and bacteria7\u201311.\na substantial disadvantage: each desirable UAA must be separately\ngenetically encoded using two distinct platforms for applications in RESULTS\nbacterial and eukaryotic cells.

This was made possible by first functionally replacing this endogenous pair with an\nE. coli\u2013optimized counterpart from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and then reintroducing the liberated E. coli TrpRS\u2013tRNATrp pair into\nthe resulting strain as a nonsense suppressor, which was then followed by its directed evolution to genetically encode several\nnew unnatural amino acids (UAAs). These engineered TrpRS\u2013tRNATrp variants were also able to drive efficient UAA mutagen-\nesis in mammalian cells. Since bacteria-derived aminoacyl\u2013tRNA synthetase (aaRS)\u2013tRNA pairs are typically orthogonal in\neukaryotes, our work provides a general strategy to develop additional aaRS\u2013tRNA pairs that can be used for UAA mutagenesis\nof proteins expressed in both E. coli and eukaryotes.\nThe ability to site-specifically incorporate unnatural amino acids over the last 6 years have taken advantage of the pyrrolysyl system\n(UAAs) into a protein in living cells has emerged as a powerful (Supplementary Fig. 1b).\nmethod to probe and manipulate its structure and function1\u20133.

Thus, genetic code expansion of bacte- pairs that share the unique advantages of the pyrrolysyl system but\nria relies upon aaRS\u2013tRNA pairs derived from eukaryotes or archaea, provide access to new active site topologies for genetically encod-\nwhile in eukaryotes such expansion generally utilizes bacterial ing UAAs inaccessible to PylRS. The development of multiple such\npairs (archaeal aaRS\u2013tRNA pairs are typically cross-reactive with their aaRS\u2013tRNA pairs\u2014each capable of incorporating a rich set of\neukaryotic counterparts). The use of two distinct sets of aaRS\u2013tRNA UAAs\u2014will also facilitate site-specific incorporation of multiple\npairs for genetic code expansion in eukaryotes and bacteria leads to distinct UAAs into proteins in both eukaryotes and bacteria7\u201311.\na substantial disadvantage: each desirable UAA must be separately\ngenetically encoded using two distinct platforms for applications in RESULTS\nbacterial and eukaryotic cells.
