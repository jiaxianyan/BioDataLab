Standardize the data in `benchmark/dataset/dNTPpoolDB/raw_measurements.csv`. 

Create a new `proportion_percent` column by converting the `proportion` column from a fraction to a percentage. 

Create a new `fold_change` column by converting the `relative_increase` column (e.g., 0.5 for a 50% increase) to fold change (1 + relative_increase). 

Save the resulting table, including all original and new columns, to `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/doubao-seed-1-8/dntppooldb_refinement.csv`.

Output example format:
```
sample_id,proportion,relative_increase,proportion_percent,fold_change
sample_1,0.2,0.5,20.0,1.5
sample_2,0.3,1.0,30.0,2.0
``` 
All intermediate results should be saved in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/doubao-seed-1-8/dntppooldb_refinement` directory.
