Furthermore, we show that SecA2 is required for the optimal secretion of superoxide dismutase (SodA) and catalase-peroxidase (KatG).

## Discussion

Our prior studies of SecA2 in M. smegmatis established SecA2 as a non-essential accessory secretion factor (Braunstein et al., 2001). We showed SecA2 to parti

Multiple laboratories have identified SodA as being released by M. tuberculosis, with  \(20 - 92\%\)  of total SodA being reported as extracellular (Abou-Zeid et al., 1988; Andersen et al., 1991; Z

The mechanism(s) for the recognition of SodA, Rv0390 and KatG for export remains to be defined as does the role of SecA2 in the process. All of these exported proteins lack classical signal sequences for Sec dependent translocation, and there was no evidence th

Our identification of SodA and KatG as being dependent on SecA2 for extracellular release could explain the attenuated phenotype of the  \(\Delta\) secA2 mutant, and it suggests a function of SecA2 is as part of a virulence mechanism o

Perfect! From the paper content, I can clearly see that KatG's release is dependent on SecA2. Let me verify this with the specific contexts:

1. "we show that SecA2 is required for the optimal secretion of superoxide dismutase (SodA) and catalase-peroxidase (KatG)"
2. "KatG release is dependent on SecA2"
3. "the release of KatG (catalase-peroxidase) is dependent on SecA2"
4. "Only three proteins were identified as being released in reduced amounts from the Δ secA2 mutant: SodA, Rv0390 and KatG"
