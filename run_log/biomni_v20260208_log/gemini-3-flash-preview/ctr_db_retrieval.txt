# Core Task
Search GEO for cancer-related datasets involving Docetaxel treatment in human samples ('Homo sapiens') by executing a query that combines the drug identifier (DRUG = 'Docetaxel'), the species limit (SPECIES = '"Homo sapiens"[Organism]'), and cancer-specific descriptors (CANCER = 'cancer OR tumor OR carcinoma OR neoplasm'). The search must be restricted to the Series data type ('"gse"[Filter]') and filtered by a specific publication window from 2021/01/01 to 2021/06/01 using the logic '("{START_DATE}"[PDAT] : "{END_DATE}"[PDAT])'. Then manually select qualified datasets that meet five criteria: (1) include baseline (pre-treatment) expression profiles; (2) have a sample size of at least 10; (3) provide raw data files (CEL for microarray, FASTQ for RNA-seq); (4) for microarray data, are restricted to platforms GPL96 [HG-U133A], GPL570 [HGU133 Plus 2], and GPL571 [HG-U133A 2].

Title: Transcriptomic analysis of breast cancer patients sensitive and resistant to chemotherapy: Looking for overall survival and drug resistance biomarkers
Summary: Purpose: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is one important therapeutic strategy for breast cancer with the drawback of resistance development. Chemotherapy has adverse effects that combined with resistance could contribute to lower overall survival. This work aimed to evaluate the molecular profile of patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy trying to discover differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that could be used as biomarkers of chemotherapy response and overall survival. Methods: Breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled in this study and according to their pathological response were assigned as sensitive or resistant. To evaluate DEGs, GO, KEGG and protein-protein interactions, RNAseq information from all patients was obtained by next generation sequencing. Results: A total of 1985 DEGs were found and KEGG analysis indicated a great number of DEGs in metabolic pathways, pathways in cancer, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions. A selection of 73 DEGs were used further for an analysis of overall survival using the METABRIC study. Seven of those DEGs were found to correlated with overall survival, of them the sub-expression of C1QTNF3, CTF1, OLFML3, PLA2R1, PODN and the over expression of TUBB and TCP1 were found in resistant patients and related to patients with lower overall survival. Conclusions: This work highlights differences at the level of gene expression in patients resistant and sensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Cellular components related to extracellular region and plasma membrane were mainly involved. Furthermore, 73 DEGs were able to discriminate patients resistant and sensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and 7 of them were able to predict overall survival.

Title: Novel long non‐coding RNA 005620 induces epirubicin resistance of triple-negative breast cancer via regulating ITGB1 expression
Summary: In this study, a total of 12 differentially expressed lncRNAs were established through lncRNA sequencing analysis. Lnc005620 is one of the novel intronic lncRNAs which is highly expressed in Epi-R MDA-MB-231. Lnc005620 is an important lncRNA that leads to the resistance of Epirubicin in triple negative breast cancer by integrin β1.

Title: Gene expression profiling of drug-persistent breast and prostate cancer cells derived from treatment of organoids or PDX with cytotoxic agents
Summary: Cancer treatments often fail to achieve complete and sustained responses due to persistent residual tumor foci with acquired drug refractoriness, the “seed” for eventual relapse. The biological underpinning of this in situ resistance is not clear, while faithful in vitro models of this cancer cell state are lacking. We observed that the in vitro cytotoxic treatment of breast and prostate cancer patient-derived cells and cell lines cultured as 3D organoids generates persistent tumor cell subpopulations that phenotypically and molecularly simulate the in vivo emergence of drug-refractory residual tumors in preclinical and clinical settings. Here we provide RNAseq gene expression profiling data from drug-persistent cancer cells generated after longitudinal treatment of cancer organoids or PDX/xenograft tumors with chemotherapeutic (docetaxel, vinblastine) or targeted (afatinib) agents. These data can be used to identify genes and pathways which are upregulated in residual drug-persistent tumors.

Title: Identification of Genes Promoting Resistance to Enzalutamide
Summary: In 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration approved enzalutamide (Xtandi) for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have previously received docetaxel. In most patients, enzalutamide halts progression of the disease for a short period of time, but patients usually relapse, which is associated with poor prognosis. Identifying the genes and pathways that the cancer cells use to overcome enzalutamide are of interest, because new interventions aimed at preventing relapse after enzalutamide therapy would have therapeutic value to late-stage prostate cancer patients. In this study, we took advantage of RNA interference techniques and an in vitro model of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells to identify genes that drive resistance to enzalutamide.

Title: Parental (F0) compared to MSC educated (F2) prostate cancer cell lines
Summary: Our studies demonstrated that bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) drive the emergence of an apoptosis resistant population of prostate cancer cells that are also cross resistant to chemotherapy such as docetaxel. The goals of this RNAQuant study was to determine differential gene expression between the naïve and MSC educated prostate cancer cells in order to better understand the mechanisms underlying apoptosis resistance.

The core task was to search NCBI GEO for cancer-related datasets involving Docetaxel treatment in human samples within a specific publication window (2021/01/01 to 2021/06/01) and filter them based on four specific criteria: (1) inclusion of baseline/pre-treatment expression profiles; (2) sample size ≥ 10; (3) availability of raw data (CEL or FASTQ); and (4) specific microarray platforms (GPL96, GPL570, GPL571) if applicable.

After executing the search query `(Docetaxel) AND ("Homo sapiens"[Organism]) AND (cancer OR tumor OR carcinoma OR neoplasm) AND ("gse"[Filter]) AND ("2021/01/01"[PDAT] : "2021/06/01"[PDAT])`, five datasets were identified: GSE162187, GSE152003, GSE162285, GSE156816, and GSE163374. 

Evaluation of these datasets against the criteria:
- **GSE162187**: Sample size is 22. However, the study focuses on profiling patients *after* receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy to compare sensitive and resistant profiles. It does not explicitly include or define baseline (pre-treatment) samples in the series.
- **GSE152003**: Sample size is 9, which fails the $N \ge 10$ requirement.
- **GSE162285**: Sample size is 91. While it involves longitudinal treatment, the primary focus is on "drug-persistent" cells. Detailed metadata inspection did not confirm the presence of a clearly defined baseline/pre-treatment control group in the standard format required.
- **GSE156816**: Sample size is 8, which fails the $N \ge 10$ requirement.
- **GSE163374**: Sample size is 12. It compares "Parental (F0)" (baseline) to "MSC educated (F2)" prostate cancer cell lines. This meets the baseline requirement, sample size requirement, and provides raw data via SRA (RNA-seq).

The final assessment results are as follows:
