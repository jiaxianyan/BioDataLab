Process quality control and genomic mapping of the the raw sequencing data located at `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/rna_seq/SRR942022_1.fastq`.

Using fastp with default parameters.

The reference genome located at `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/ref/TAIR10_chr_all.fas`.

Converting the alignment output into BAM format and perform coordinate-based sorting.

Saving the final bam file in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-flash-preview/asmdb_refinement_2.bam`

All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-flash-preview/asmdb_refinement_2/`

I will now process the raw sequencing data through quality control, alignment, and BAM processing.

### Plan
1. [ ] Create the necessary directories for temporary results and output.
2. [ ] Run `fastp` for quality control and preprocessing of the raw FASTQ data.
3. [ ] Index the reference genome using `hisat2-build`.
4. [ ] Align the processed reads to the reference genome using `hisat2`.
5. [ ] Convert the alignment SAM file to a sorted BAM file using `samtools`.
6. [ ] Move the final BAM file to the designated output path and clean up if necessary.

### Step 1: Create directories
I will start by creating the temporary directory and the final output directory.

<execute>
#!BASH
mkdir -p /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-flash-preview/asmdb_refinement_2/
mkdir -p /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-flash-preview/</execute>
<observation></observation>
I have created the necessary directories for the temporary and final output. Now, I will proceed to perform quality control using `fastp` on the raw sequencing data.

### Plan
1. [✓] Create the necessary directories for temporary results and output. (completed)
2. [ ] Run `fastp` for quality control and preprocessing of the raw FASTQ data.
3. [ ] Index the reference genome using `hisat2-build`.
4. [ ] Align the processed reads to the reference genome using `hisat2`.
5. [ ] Convert the alignment SAM file to a sorted BAM file using `samtools`.
6. [ ] Move the final BAM file to the designated output path and clean up if necessary.

### Step 2: Run `fastp`
I will run `fastp` with default parameters. Since it's single-end data (based on the provided file `SRR942022_1.fastq`), I'll specify the input and output file paths.

<execute>
#!BASH
fastp -i benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/rna_seq/SRR942022_1.fastq \
      -o /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-flash-preview/asmdb_refinement_2/SRR942022_1_clean.fastq \
      -h /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-flash-preview/asmdb_refinement_2/fastp_report.html \
      -j /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-flash-preview/asmdb_refinement_2/fastp_report.json</execute>
<observation></observation>
I have completed the quality control step using `fastp`. Now, I will proceed to index the reference genome using `hisat2-build`.

### Plan
1. [✓] Create the necessary directories for temporary results and output. (completed)
2. [✓] Run `fastp` for quality control and preprocessing of the raw FASTQ data. (completed)
3. [ ] Index the reference genome using `hisat2-build`.
4. [ ] Align the processed reads to the reference genome using `hisat2`.
5. [ ] Convert the alignment SAM file to a sorted BAM file using `samtools`.
6. [ ] Move the final BAM file to the designated output path and clean up if necessary.

### Step 3: Index the reference genome
I will use `hisat2-build` to index the reference genome located at `benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/ref/TAIR10_chr_all.fas`. I will store the index files in the temporary directory.

<execute>
#!BASH
hisat2-build benchmark/dataset/ASMdb/ref/TAIR10_chr_all.fas /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-flash-preview/asmdb_refinement_2/TAIR10_index</execute>

I have successfully indexed the reference genome. Now I will proceed to align the processed reads to the reference using `hisat2`.

### Plan
1. [✓] Create the necessary directories for temporary results and output. (completed)
2. [✓] Run `fastp` for quality control and preprocessing of the raw FASTQ data. (completed)
3. [✓] Index the reference genome using `hisat2-build`. (completed)
4. [ ] Align the processed reads to the reference genome using `hisat2`.
5. [ ] Convert the alignment SAM file to a sorted BAM file using `samtools`.
6. [ ] Move the final BAM file to the designated output path and clean up if necessary.

### Step 4: Align the processed reads
I will align the clean FASTQ file generated by `fastp` to the indexed reference genome.

<execute>
#!BASH
hisat2 -x /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-flash-preview/asmdb_refinement_2/TAIR10_index \
       -U /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-flash-preview/asmdb_refinement_2/SRR942022_1_clean.fastq \
       -S /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-flash-preview/asmdb_refinement_2/SRR942022_1.sam</execute>
<observation></observation>
I have aligned the reads and generated the SAM file. Now, I will convert the SAM file to a sorted BAM file using `samtools`.

### Plan
1. [✓] Create the necessary directories for temporary results and output. (completed)
2. [✓] Run `fastp` for quality control and preprocessing of the raw FASTQ data. (completed)
3. [✓] Index the reference genome using `hisat2-build`. (completed)
4. [✓] Align the processed reads to the reference genome using `hisat2`. (completed)
5. [ ] Convert the alignment SAM file to a sorted BAM file using `samtools`.
6. [ ] Move the final BAM file to the designated output path and clean up if necessary.

### Step 5: Convert SAM to sorted BAM
I will use `samtools view` to convert the SAM file to BAM and `samtools sort` to sort the BAM file by coordinates. I will then save the final BAM file to the requested location.

<execute>
#!BASH
samtools view -bS /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-flash-preview/asmdb_refinement_2/SRR942022_1.sam | \
samtools sort -o /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-flash-preview/asmdb_refinement_2.bam</execute>
<observation></observation>
I have completed the processing of the raw sequencing data `SRR942022_1.fastq`. The process included quality control using `fastp`, indexing the reference genome `TAIR10_chr_all.fas` with `hisat2-build`, aligning the clean reads with `hisat2`, and finally converting and sorting the alignment into a BAM file using `samtools`.

### Plan
1. [✓] Create the necessary directories for temporary results and output. (completed)
2. [✓] Run `fastp` for quality control and preprocessing of the raw FASTQ data. (completed)
3. [✓] Index the reference genome using `hisat2-build`. (completed)
4. [✓] Align the processed reads to the reference genome using `hisat2`. (completed)
5. [✓] Convert the alignment SAM file to a sorted BAM file using `samtools`. (completed)
6. [✓] Move the final BAM file to the designated output path and clean up if necessary. (completed)

The final sorted BAM file is saved at:
<solution>/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-flash-preview/asmdb_refinement_2.bam</solution>
