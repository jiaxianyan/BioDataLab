Effect of disruption of  STAT3 Y705 phosphorylation on lung gene expression in mice during influenza virus infection\n(Submitter supplied) To investigate the functional relevance of the STAT3 Y705 in antiviral immunity, we established STAT3 705 tyrosine site mutation (STAT3Y705F/+) mice and infected them with influenza virus for 24 h, then collected the lungs. We then performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of 3 different samples.\nOrganism:\tMus musculus\nType:\t\tExpression profiling by high throughput sequencing; Non-coding RNA profiling by high throughput sequencing\nPlatform: GPL24247 6 Samples\nFTP download: GEO (TXT) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE213nnn/GSE213834/\nSeries\t\tAccession: GSE213834\tID: 200213834\n\n2. Study of Conserved Motifs in Senecavirus A Genome\n(Submitter supplied) \tRibosome sequencing (Ribo-seq) technology was employed to analyze key sequences regulating translation elongation in the Senecavirus A (SVA) genome and to evaluate their impact on viral replication, thereby providing a theoretical foundation for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of SVA.First, the translation rate of the whole genome of SVA was analyzed using rSVA-GFP as a model via Ribo-seq technology. Based on the significant ribosome enrichment peaks detected by Ribo-seq, synonymous mutations were introduced into the corresponding sequences. After chemical synthesis, these sequences were substituted into the full-length cDNA backbone to obtain recombinant plasmids. Subsequently, reverse genetics was employed to transfect the plasmid into BHK-21 cells to rescue the replication-competent recombinant virus. A series of experiments, including blind passage, RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and growth curve analysis, were conducted on the recombinant virus to characterize its biological properties. Representative recombinant viruses were selected for secondary Ribo-seq analysis to elucidate the effects of the modification site on viral replication and protein translation.Ribo-seq data revealed significant ribosomal translation -stall peaks in VP1, 2C, and 3D genes, suggesting that key motifs impeding ribosomal translocation may be present in these regions. It was hypothesized that these regions may contain key motifs that impede ribosomal translocation. To test this hypothesis, these regions were further synonymously mutated to construct recombinant viruses. The results indicated that only the mutant in the 3D region successfully rescued replication-competent viruse that remained genetically stable through 20 passages and had no significant impact on viral growth kinetics. It suggested that the motifs in the 3D region were nonessential for viral replication. In contrast, the motifs, corresponding to the Ribo-seq-specific peaks in the VP1 and 2C regions, were essential for viral replication. The further Ribo-seq analysis of the rescued virus revealed the absence of ribosomal stalling peaks in both the 2C and 3D regions. This suggested that the key motifs in the 2C region, if any, were not the sole determinant of the translation rate of viral proteins. In contrast, disrupting any such structures in the 3D region did not impact viral replication but could affect the rates of viral protein translation.\nOrganism:\tSenecavirus A\nType:\t\tOther\nPlatform: GPL36243 6 Samples\nFTP download: GEO (XLSX) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE308nnn/GSE308036/\nSeries\t\tAccession: GSE308036\tID: 200308036\n\n3. Host cell Z-RNAs activate ZBP1 during virus infections [MEF]\n(Submitter supplied) \tHerpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and Influenza A viruses (IAV) trigger Z-form nucleic acid Binding Protein 1 (ZBP1)-initiated cell death. ZBP1 is activated by Z-RNA, and the Z-RNAs which activate ZBP1 during HSV-1 and IAV infections were assumed to be of viral origin. However, we show here that host cell-encoded Z-RNAs are major and sufficient ZBP1 activating ligands following infection by these two human pathogens. The majority of cellular Z-RNAs mapped to intergenic endogenous retroelements (EREs) embedded within abnormally long 3\u2019 extensions of host cell mRNAs. These aberrant host cell transcripts arose as a consequence of Disruption of Transcription Termination (DoTT), a virus-driven phenomenon which disables Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor (CPSF)-mediated 3\u2019 processing of nascent pre-mRNAs. Mutant viruses lacking ICP27 or NS1, the virus-encoded proteins responsible for inhibiting CPSF and triggering DoTT, failed to induce host cell Z-RNA accrual and were attenuated in their ability to stimulate ZBP1. Ectopic expression of HSV-1 ICP27 or IAV NS1, or pharmacological blockade of CPSF activity, induced accumulation of host cell Z-RNAs and activated ZBP1. These results demonstrate that DoTT-generated cellular Z-RNAs are bona fide ZBP1 ligands, and position ZBP1-activated cell death as a host response to counter viral disruption of the cellular transcriptional machinery.\nOrganism:\tMus musculus\nType:\t\tOther\nPlatform: GPL24247 56 Samples\nFTP download: GEO (TSV) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE308nnn/GSE308488/\nSeries\t\tAccession: GSE308488\tID: 200308488\n\n4.

Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are dispensable or detrimental in murine systemic or respiratory viral infections [RNA-Seq 2]\n(Submitter supplied) \tPlasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are major producers of type I/III interferons. Since these cytokines are crucial for antiviral defense, it is assumed to be also the case for pDCs. However, robust evidence supporting this dogma is scarce. Genetic mutations or pharmacological manipulations causing pDC loss or disrupting their interferon production affect other immune cells, which could confound interpretation. To overcome this bottleneck, we engineered pDC-less mice, specifically and constitutively devoid of pDCs because expressing diphteria toxin under coordinated control by the Siglech and Pacsin1 genes co-expressed only in pDCs. pDC-less mice mounted protective intrinsic and innate immune responses against systemic infection with mouse cytomegalovirus, and were more resistant to intranasal infection with influenza virus and SARS-CoV2. Thus, contrary to dogma, pDCs and their interferon production proved dispensable or deleterious during systemic or respiratory viral infections. pDC-less mice will enable rigorously revisiting the roles of pDCs in health and disease.\nOrganism:\tMus musculus\nType:\t\tExpression profiling by high throughput sequencing\nPlatform: GPL30172 22 Samples\nFTP download: GEO (COUNTS) ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE302nnn/GSE302271/\nSeries\t\tAccession: GSE302271\tID: 200302271\n</observation>"
