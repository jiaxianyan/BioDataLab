Inhibitors of GMII are potential cancer therapeutics, but their usefulness is limited by off- target effects, which produce  \\(\\alpha\\)  - mannosidosis- like symptoms. Despite many structural and mechanistic studies of GMII, we still lack a potent and selective inhibitor of this enzyme. Here, we synthesized manno- epicyclophellitol epoxide and aziridines and demonstrate their covalent modification and time- dependent inhibition of GMII. Application of fluorescent manno- epi- cyclophellitol aziridine derivatives enabled activity- based protein profiling of  \\(\\alpha\\)  - mannosidases from both human cell lysate and mouse tissue extracts. Synthesized probes also facilitated a fluorescence polarization- based screen for dGMII inhibitors. We identified seven previously unknown inhibitors of GMII from a library of over 350 iminosugars and investigated their binding modalities through X- ray crystallography. Our results reveal previously unobserved inhibitor binding modes and promising scaffolds for the generation of selective GMII inhibitors.\n\n![](images/13699143d22cdcc32100b6909544c234052b4ce3e2cefeb35e442afc35773792.jpg)\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nGolgi  \\(\\alpha\\)  - mannosidase (GMII, MAN2A1, mannosyl- oligosaccharide  \\(1,3 / 1,6 - \\alpha\\)  - mannosidase) is a glycoside hydrolase from CAZy family  \\(\\mathrm{GH38^1}\\)  that catalyzes sequential hydrolysis of both the terminal  \\(\\alpha - 1,3\\cdot\\)  and 1,6- linked mannoses from the  \\(N\\cdot\\)  glycan  \\(\\mathrm{GlcNAcMan}_5\\mathrm{GlcNAc}_2\\)  Figure 1A), which is a committed step in the formation of complex  \\(N\\cdot\\)  glycans.2 Altered  \\(N\\cdot\\)  glycan branching has been directly linked to the metastatic potential of cells,4 and consequently, inhibitors of GMII are a potential target for anticancer therapeutics. The potent GMII mannosidase inhibitor swainsonine (Figure 1B), first identified in locoweed, has been investigated in this capacity. Swainsonine treatment reduces metastasis and improves outcome in breast, colon, and skin cancers.6- 8 However, swainsonine also produces side effects resembling the lysosomal storage disease  \\(\\alpha\\)  - mannosidosis,10 resulting from the off- target inhibition of lysosomal  \\(\\alpha\\)  - mannosidase MAN2B1 (LAM).\n\nAs GMII is an important anticancer target, many studies have sought to identify or design new and selective inhibitors. One avenue that has been explored is the modification of existing GMII inhibitors such as swainsonine and mannostatin A (Figure 1B). Swainsonine derivatives containing C5- substituents have been investigated, and although these compounds maintain inhibitory potency against Drosophila GMII (dGMII; 40% identity to human GMII), selectivity over Drosophila lysosomal mannosidase (dLAM; 45% identity to human LAM) is modest.11 Mannostatin A, a natural product  \\(\\alpha\\) - mannosidase inhibitor produced by Streptoverticillium verticillus12 (Figure 1B), has also been derivatized in a similar fashion;13 however the analogues had a reduced specificity for human GMII over human LAM. Another class of inhibitor, the hydroxylated pyrrolidines, has also been investigated in the context of GMII inhibition. This class of mannosidase inhibitor was first identified by Popowycz et al.,14 and functionalized\n\n![](images/e2625c76f0dd6e56f7981583f83b997011fab8612160896022911ff4f3f006b2.jpg)  \nFigure 1. (A) Catalytic activity of Golgi  \\(\\alpha\\) -mannosidase. (B) Historical inhibitors of GMII.\n\nhydroxylated pyrrolidines have subsequently been determined to be more selective toward GMII.  \\({ }^{15- 18}\\)  A different approach to identify inhibitors was employed by Kuntz and coworkers.  \\({ }^{19}\\)  Using a fluorogenic reporter substrate the authors screened a focused library of potential glycosidase inhibitors for action against dGMII. This study revealed several compounds including glucoimidazole and mannoimidazole, both with low micromolar inhibition constants for dGMII.\n\nIn the pursuit of new inhibitors of GMII we have applied the considerable power of cyclophellitol- like activity- based probes (ABPs).  \\({ }^{20}\\)  Herein we report the covalent inhibition of GMII with manno- epi- cyclophellitol epoxide and aziridine. A fluorescent derivative of the manno- epi- cyclophellitol aziridine enabled activity- based protein profiling (ABPP) of GH38  \\(\\alpha\\) - mannosidases in both cells overexpressing human GH38s and mouse tissue extracts. This labeling could be reduced with known inhibitors of GH38s. We next developed a high- throughput fluorescence polarization ABPP screen for  \\(\\alpha\\) - mannosidase inhibitors. Screening of our in- house focused library of over 350 iminosugars revealed seven previously unidentified GMII inhibitors, some of which were found by X- ray crystallography to bind in modes distinct from previously observed inhibitors. Together this gives us fresh insight into the design of GMII inhibitors and lead compounds for the creation of second- generation GMII inhibitors while also providing a high- throughput screening protocol for future library assessment.\n\n## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nManno- epi- cyclophellitols Are Time- Dependent Inhibitors of dGMII. GMII is a GH38 retaining  \\(\\alpha\\) - D- mannosidase that employs a two- step, double- displacement mechanism in which a covalent- enzyme intermediate is flanked by oxocarbenium- ion- like transition states.  \\({ }^{21}\\)  We reasoned that as the GH38 mechanism processes through a covalent intermediate, GMII would be an ideal target for the cyclophellitol class of GH inhibitors, which have become a powerful scaffold for the creation of activity- based glycosidase probes.  \\({ }^{20}\\)  The cyclophellitol class of GH inhibitors covalently modify retaining GHs, and activity- based probes bearing cyclophellitol warheads have enabled high- throughput inhibitor and drug discovery,  \\({ }^{22}\\)  biomass enzyme profiling,  \\({ }^{23}\\)  and detailed conformational and structural insight.  \\({ }^{24,25}\\)\n\nBoth the manno- epi- cyclophellitol epoxide (1) and aziridine (2) were synthesized (see Figure 2 and the Supporting\n\n![](images/5b3ac3402682a27d9be2b1d5754f19c6e9b401eb1fb2e9afc483e86cab773fd1.jpg)  \nFigure 2. Manno-epi-cyclophellitol inhibitors and probes used in this work.\n\nInformation for synthetic details) to ascertain whether these inhibitors could target dGMII. When 1 and 2 were incubated with recombinant dGMII, we observed that both displayed time- dependent inhibition, which is typical for cyclophellitol- type inhibitors (see Figure S1). To compare the reactivity of these two compounds, second- order rate constants  \\(\\left(k_{\\text{inact}} / K_{\\text{I}}\\right)\\)  were determined using 4- methylumbelliferyl  \\(\\alpha\\) - D- mannopyranoside (MU-  \\(\\alpha\\) - Man) as a substrate. The  \\(k_{\\text{inact}} / K_{\\text{I}}\\)  value for 1 was determined to be  \\(50 \\pm 5 \\mathrm{min}^{- 1} \\mathrm{M}^{- 1}\\) , while the observed inhibition constant for aziridine 2 was over 100- fold higher  \\(\\left(5500 \\pm 100 \\mathrm{min}^{- 1} \\mathrm{M}^{- 1}\\right)\\) . This enhanced inhibition of 2 is consistent with the trend previously observed for  \\(\\alpha\\) - glucosidases by epi- cyclophellitol epoxides and aziridines.  \\({ }^{26}\\)\n\nWe next obtained a crystal structure of dGMII that had been soaked with aziridine 2. The reacted manno- epi- cyclophellitol moiety is covalently linked to the nucleophile Asp204 in the X- ray structure (Figure 3B). This structure clearly shows the opening of the aziridine ring resulting from nucleophilic attack at the pseudoanomeric carbon (Figure 3A). The resulting enzyme- bound cyclitol structure displays a  \\({ }^{1} \\mathrm{~S}_{5}\\)  skew boat conformation, which is consistent with the proposed  \\({ }^{0} \\mathrm{~S}_{2} / \\mathrm{B}_{2,5} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{B}_{2,5}{}_{2}^{+} \\rightarrow {}^{1} \\mathrm{~S}_{5}\\)  reaction itinerary for GH38  \\(\\alpha\\) - mannosidases.  \\({ }^{21,27}\\)  Comparison to the structure of 2- deoxy- 2- fluoro- D- mannose bound to the dGMII D341N acid/base mutant  \\({ }^{21}\\)\n\n![](images/e199f9541834e2daea09e432f6c1a6fd8d570a2bdafeefa181d410465c226ed4.jpg)  \nFigure 3.

Specifically, it mentions \"the opening of the aziridine ring resulting from nucleophilic attack at the pseudoanomeric carbon\" and \"manno-epi-cyclophellitol epoxide... covalent inhibition\". \n\nFrom the list of mechanisms provided:\nAziridine Opening; Beta-Lactam Addition; Borylation; Composite Reaction; Cyclohemiaminoacetalization; Disulfide Formation; Epoxide Opening; Hemiaminalization; Hemi(thio)acetalization; Imidazolidinone Opening; Imine Condensation; Lactone Addition; Michael Addition; Nucleophilic Acyl Substitution; Nucleophilic Addition to a Double Bond; Nucleophilic Addition to a Triple Bond; Nucleophilic Aliphatic Subsititution; Nucleophilic Aromatic Substitution; Phosphorylation; Ring Opening; Sulfonylation.\n\nBoth \"Aziridine Opening\" and \"Epoxide Opening\" are relevant, but the detailed mechanism described for the probe (2) is \"opening of the aziridine ring\". However, the class of inhibitors is referred to as cyclophellitols which are epoxides or aziridines. In the context of \"Ring Opening\" vs specific ones, the provided list contains \"Aziridine Opening\" and \"Epoxide Opening\". Usually, if both are present in the paper, it might be a \"Composite Reaction\" or we choose the one highlighted in the structural analysis. The structural analysis (Figure 3) specifically shows \"opening of the aziridine ring\". \n\nWait, looking at the list again: \"Aziridine Opening\", \"Epoxide Opening\", and \"Ring Opening\". Since the paper highlights both epoxide and aziridine variants and their ring-opening mechanism, \"Ring Opening\" might be the most general fit, but \"Aziridine Opening\" or \"Epoxide Opening\" are more specific. Given the title and figures focus heavily on the aziridine-based ABP for profiling, and the crystal structure shows \"opening of the aziridine ring\", I will check if \"Aziridine Opening\" is the most appropriate. Actually, many databases classify cyclophellitols under \"Epoxide Opening\" or \"Aziridine Opening\". Since the paper covers both but details the aziridine mechanism for the probe, I will select \"Aziridine Opening\" or \"Epoxide Opening\". Let's look at the instructions. It says \"Determining the covalent bonding mechanisms\". \n\nWait, the prompt asks to determine the mechanism. Cyclophellitols are classic \"Epoxide Opening\" (the natural product is an epoxide) or \"Aziridine Opening\" (the nitrogen analog). The text says: \"demonstrate their covalent modification ... of GMII ... opening of the aziridine ring\".\n\nLet's check the list again. \"Epoxide Opening\" and \"Aziridine Opening\" are both there. \"Ring Opening\" is also there. If I have to pick one that covers the most prominent part of the structural work: The X-ray structure (Figure 3) is of the aziridine.\n\nHowever, cyclophellitol itself is an epoxide. I will check for \"Epoxide Opening\" as it is the most common classification for these types of covalent inhibitors in GHs, but the paper uses both. I will use \"Aziridine Opening\" if I have to pick one based on the specific evidence provided (Figure 3). But often these are grouped.\n\nLet's look at the abstract again: \"synthesized manno-epicyclophellitol epoxide and aziridines and demonstrate their covalent modification...\".\n\nActually, the mechanism for both is ring opening. I will go with \"Aziridine Opening\" as the most specific one demonstrated with X-ray data in the paper. Or \"Epoxide Opening\". \n\nWait, usually \"Ring Opening\" is a category. If I must choose one: the paper's main discovery/application is the aziridine ABP.\n\nLet's re-read: \"This structure clearly shows the opening of the aziridine ring\".\n\nI'll check the provided options again.\n\"Aziridine Opening\"\n\"Epoxide Opening\"\n\nI'll save \"Aziridine Opening\".\n\n<execute>\n#!BASH\necho \"Aziridine Opening\" > /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-flash-preview/covpdb_annotate.txt</execute>"
