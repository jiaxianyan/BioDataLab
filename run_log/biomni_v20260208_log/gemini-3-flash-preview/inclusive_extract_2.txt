# Core Task
You are a specialized Bioinformatics NLP Agent acting as an expert in Chemical Biology and Genetic Code Expansion (GCE). Your core competency is the high-fidelity extraction of chemical and experimental data from scientific literature regarding non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs). You will process specific PDF publications to identify ncAAs, their nomenclature, and their corresponding chemical structures represented as SMILES notations.

# Workflow Instructions
- `Literature Processing`: Parse the provided PDF files located at `benchmark/dataset/iNClusive/`.
- `Information Extraction & Chemical Identification`:
  1) ncAA Abbreviation: Extract the short-hand abbreviation(s) for the ncAAs used in the publication. If not found, use "not available".
  2) ncAA Name: Extract the full chemical or common name as mentioned in the text. If not found, use "not available".
  3) SMILES Extraction: Identify and extract the SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) string for each corresponding ncAA. This may require cross-referencing names/structures mentioned in the text with chemical databases if the string is not explicitly provided.

# Input File Path
Input Path: `benchmark/dataset/iNClusive/` (Files: paper_data_25.pdf, paper_data_73.pdf, paper_data_249_274.pdf, paper_data_342.pdf, paper_data_2228_2230.pdf)

# Output Requirements & File Path
For each input PDF, generate a separate CSV file using a semicolon (;) as the delimiter.
Output Path: /root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-flash-preview/inclusive_extract_2/
Naming Convention: Output filenames must match the input PDF filename (e.g., paper_data_25.pdf results in paper_data_25.csv).
Three Columns: "ncAA abbreviation(s) used in the publication", "ncAA name, as mentioned in the publication", "ncAA SMILES notation"

# Intermediate Results
All intermediate files generated should be saved in the directly `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-flash-preview/inclusive_extract_2`

1. [ ] List the files in the input directory `benchmark/dataset/iNClusive/`.
2. [ ] For each PDF file:
    a. [ ] Extract text and metadata from the PDF using `pdfplumber` or other tools.
    b. [ ] Identify non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs), their abbreviations, and names from the text.
    c. [ ] Determine the SMILES notation for each identified ncAA (via text search or cross-referencing).
    d. [ ] Format the extracted information into a CSV with columns: "ncAA abbreviation(s) used in the publication", "ncAA name, as mentioned in the publication", "ncAA SMILES notation".
    e. [ ] Save the CSV file to the output directory `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-flash-preview/inclusive_extract_2/` with the appropriate name.
3. [ ] Verify the existence and content of the generated files.

Let's start by listing the files and creating the necessary directories.

It seems I'm having issues with the environment retaining the import of `pdfplumber` within the same block or something is interfering with the standard Python execution in the `execute` block. I will try importing and using it in a single block carefully, and use `print` statements to ensure I see the content. If `pdfplumber` fails, I will try a bash command to convert PDF to text.

Now I will analyze the extracted text for each PDF and extract the required information.

**Paper 1: paper_data_25.pdf**
- From the snippet: "Site-Specific Incorporation of a Redox-Active Amino Acid into Proteins", "Lital Alfonta... Peter G. Schultz".
- Searching for the ncAA: Common ncAAs in Schultz lab papers include $p$-acetylphenylalanine, etc.
- Let's look closer at the text. I'll search for "amino acid" or figure captions in the text.

**Paper 2: paper_data_73.pdf**
- Title: "A genetically encoded fluorescent amino acid".
- Authors: Daniel Summerer, Peter G. Schultz.
- Often this is $L$-(7-hydroxycoumarin-4-yl)ethylglycine or similar.

**Paper 3: paper_data_249_274.pdf**
- Title: "a genetically incorporated crosslinker reveals chaperone cooperation in acid resistance".
- Authors: Meng Zhang, Peng R Chen.
- Crosslinkers: DiZPK, pBpa, etc.

**Paper 4: paper_data_342.pdf**
- Title: "SH3 Domain Based Phototrapping in Living Cells Reveals Rho Family GAP Signaling Complexes".
- Authors: Hirokazu Okada, Scott H. Soderling.
- Likely uses a photo-crosslinker like pBpa or DiZPK.

**Paper 5: paper_data_2228_2230.pdf**
- Title: "A Versatile Strategy for Screening Custom-Designed Warhead-Armed Cyclic Peptide Inhibitors".
- Authors: Deokhee Kang, Hee-Sung Park.
- Warhead-armed ncAAs.

I will write a script to extract more text context around "amino acid", "SMILES" (unlikely to be in text), "structure", and "abbreviation" to identify the molecules.

Based on the extracted text and chemical knowledge of these specific papers:

**1. paper_data_25.pdf**
- Abbreviation: DHP, 1
- Name: 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine
- SMILES: `N[C@@H](Cc1ccc(O)c(O)c1)C(=O)O`

**2. paper_data_73.pdf**
- Abbreviation: 1, DanAla
- Name: 2-amino-3-(5-(dimethylamino)naphthalene-1-sulfonamide)propanoic acid
- SMILES: `CN(C)c1cccc2c(S(=O)(=O)NC[C@@H](N)C(=O)O)cccc12`

**3. paper_data_249_274.pdf**
- Looking at "a genetically incorporated crosslinker reveals chaperone cooperation in acid resistance" (Zhang et al. 2011).
- This paper describes DiZPK.
- Abbreviation: DiZPK
- Name: 3-(3-methyl-3H-diazirin-3-yl)prop-1-yl-Gln or similar. Wait, DiZPK is $N^\epsilon$-(3-(3-methyl-3H-diazirin-3-yl)prop-1-ylcarbonyl)-L-lysine. Actually, the name in the paper is usually simplified.
- SMILES: `CC1(CCCN(C(=O)[C@H](N)CCCCN)C1)N=N`? No, DiZPK is `CC1(CCC(=O)NCCCC[C@@H](N)C(=O)O)N=N`.

**4. paper_data_342.pdf**
- "SH3 Domain Based Phototrapping..." by Okada et al.
- They use pBpa (p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine).
- Abbreviation: pBpa
- Name: p-benzoyl-L-phenylalanine
- SMILES: `N[C@@H](Cc1ccc(cc1)C(=O)c2ccccc2)C(=O)O`

**5. paper_data_2228_2230.pdf**
- "A Versatile Strategy for Screening Custom-Designed Warhead-Armed Cyclic Peptide Inhibitors" (Kang et al. 2023).
- They use various warheads like SuFEx or chloroacetamide. A common one is 2-amino-3-(4-(2-chloroacetamido)phenyl)propanoic acid or similar.
- I will check the text for "warhead".

Let's refine the extraction for the last three.
