The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation. So you can decompose your code into multiple steps.\nDon't overcomplicate the code. Keep it simple and easy to understand.\nWhen writing the code, please print out the steps and results in a clear and concise manner, like a research log.\nWhen calling the existing python functions in the function dictionary, YOU MUST SAVE THE OUTPUT and PRINT OUT the result.\nFor example, result = understand_scRNA(XXX) print(result)\nOtherwise the system will not be able to know what has been done.\n\nFor R code, use the #!R marker at the beginning of your code block to indicate it's R code.\nFor Bash scripts and commands, use the #!BASH marker at the beginning of your code block. This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\nImport file: assistant.tool_biodatalab.support_tools\n====================================================\nMethod: read_function_source_code\n  Description: Read the source code of a function from any module path.\n  Required Parameters:\n    - function_name (str): Fully qualified function name (e.g., 'bioagentos.tool.support_tools.write_python_code') [Default: None]\n\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module.

Numerous studies have shown the relationship between abnormal lipid metabolism-related genes (LMRGs) and malignancies. In most studies, the single LMRG was studied and has limited clinical application value. This study aims to develop a novel LMRG prognostic model for HCC patients and to study its utility for predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine.

Here, we show that RalA, a small GTPase in the Ras downstream signaling pathway, has a critical effect on regulating the self-renewal of LSCs and HSCs. A RalA knock-in mouse model (RalA<sup>Rosa26-Tg/+</sup>) was initially constructe...\n----------------------------------------\nPMID: 36891902\nTITLE: Peripheral Ischemia Imprints Epigenetic Changes in Hematopoietic Stem Cells to Propagate Inflammation and Atherosclerosis.\nABSTRACT: Peripheral ischemia caused by peripheral artery disease is associated with systemic inflammation, which may aggravate underlying comorbidities such as atherosclerosis and heart failure. However, the mechanisms of increased inflammation and inflammatory cell production in patients with peripheral artery disease remain poorly understood. We used peripheral blood collected from patients with peripheral artery disease and performed hind limb ischemia (HI) in <i>Apoe</i><sup><i>-/-</i></sup> mice fed...\n----------------------------------------\nPMID: 36868235\nTITLE: Endothelial and Leptin Receptor<sup>+</sup> cells promote the maintenance of stem cells and hematopoiesis in early postnatal murine bone marrow.\nABSTRACT: Mammalian hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) colonize the bone marrow during late fetal development, and this becomes the major site of hematopoiesis after birth. However, little is known about the early postnatal bone marrow niche. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of mouse bone marrow stromal cells at 4\u00a0days, 14\u00a0days, and 8\u00a0weeks after birth. Leptin-receptor-expressing (LepR<sup>+</sup>) stromal cells and endothelial cells increased in frequency during this period and changed their properti...\n----------------------------------------\nPMID: 36813966\nTITLE: Chemically defined cytokine-free expansion of human haematopoietic stem cells.\nABSTRACT: Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are a rare cell type that reconstitute the entire blood and immune systems after transplantation and can be used as a curative cell therapy for a variety of haematological diseases<sup>1,2</sup>. However, the low number of HSCs in the body makes both biological analyses and clinical application difficult, and the limited extent to which human HSCs can be expanded ex vivo remains a substantial barrier to the wider and safer therapeutic use of HSC transplantation<s...\n----------------------------------------\nPMID: 36798265\nTITLE: STAT3 protects HSCs from intrinsic interferon signaling and loss of long-term blood-forming activity.\nABSTRACT: STAT3 function in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) has been difficult to discern as <i>Stat3</i> deficiency in the hematopoietic system induces systemic inflammation, which can impact HSPC activity. To address this, we established mixed bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice with CreER-mediated <i>Stat3</i> deletion in 20% of the hematopoietic compartment. <i>Stat3</i>-deficient HSPCs had impaired hematopoietic activity and failed to undergo expansion in BM in contrast to <i>Stat3</i>-suf...\n----------------------------------------\n</observation>"
