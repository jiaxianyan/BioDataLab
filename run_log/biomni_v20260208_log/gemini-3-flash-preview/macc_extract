The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>.

This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags. No empty messages.\n\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\nYou could finish the task based on current environment and you must not install new version packges as it will destory the environment !!!\n\n\n\nEnvironment Resources:\n\n- Function Dictionary:\nBased on your query, I've identified the following most relevant functions that you can use in your code:\n---\nImport file: assistant.tool_biodatalab.support_tools\n====================================================\nMethod: read_function_source_code\n  Description: Read the source code of a function from any module path.\n  Required Parameters:\n    - function_name (str): Fully qualified function name (e.g., 'bioagentos.tool.support_tools.write_python_code') [Default: None]\n\n\n---\n\nIMPORTANT: When using any function, you MUST first import it from its module.

In this issue of the JCI, Sonveaux et al. show that \nhuman cancer cells cultured under hypoxic conditions convert glucose to lactate \nand extrude it, whereas aerobic cancer cells take up lactate via monocarboxylate \ntransporter 1 (MCT1) and utilize it for oxidative phosphorylation (see the \nrelated article beginning on page 3930). When MCT1 is inhibited, aerobic cancer \ncells take up glucose rather than lactate, and hypoxic cancer cells die due to \nglucose deprivation. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with an inhibitor of MCT1 \nretarded tumor growth. MCT1 expression was detected exclusively in nonhypoxic \nregions of human cancer biopsy samples, and in combination, these data suggest \nthat MCT1 inhibition holds potential as a novel cancer therapy.\n\nDOI: 10.1172/JCI37373\nPMCID: PMC2582934\nPMID: 19033652 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nFetching PMID: 19949098\n--- PMID 19949098 ---\n1.

Because nature and intensity of T cell responses is \ncontrolled by dendritic cells (DCs), it is important to evaluate whether the \nfunction of these cells can be modulated by aldosterone. In this study we show \nthat aldosterone augmented the activation of CD8(+) T cells in a DC-dependent \nfashion. Consistently, the mineralocorticoid receptor was expressed by DCs, \nwhich showed activation of MAPK pathway and secreted IL-6 and TGF-beta in \nresponse to aldosterone. In addition, DCs stimulated with aldosterone impose a \nTh17 phenotype to CD4(+) T cells, which have recently been associated with the \npromotion of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Accordingly, we observed that \naldosterone enhances the progression of experimental autoimmune \nencephalomyelitis, an autoimmune disease promoted by Th17 cells. In addition, \nblockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor prevented all aldosterone effects on \nDCs and attenuated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis development in \naldosterone-treated mice. Our data suggest that modulation of DC function by \naldosterone enhances CD8(+) T cell activation and promotes Th17-polarized immune \nresponses, which might contribute to the inflammatory damage leading to \nhypertension and cardiovascular disease.\n\nDOI: 10.4049/jimmunol.0802886\nPMID: 19949098 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\nFetching PMID: 10483897\n--- PMID 10483897 ---\n1.

Glutamine is important in several key metabolic \nprocesses of immune cells and enterocytes. Exogenous glutamine augments the \nfunctions of lymphocytes and macrophages. Neutrophils also reportedly utilize \nglutamine at a significant rate. Our recent studies demonstrated that glutamine \nenhances neutrophil function. This article focuses on the effects of glutamine \non neutrophil function in surgical stress. Enteral glutamine administration \nenhanced peritoneal and hepatic bacterial clearance in our rat peritonitis \nmodel. Furthermore, IV glutamine supplementation improved the outcome of animals \nwith severe surgical stress. Our in vitro study revealed that supplemental \nglutamine augmented the bacterial killing function of neutrophils from \npostoperative patients. Glutamine increased phagocytosis of the neutrophils. In \naddition, glutamine dose-dependently increased production of reactive oxygen \nintermediates (ROI) by neutrophils. Thus, our studies suggest that glutamine \nsupplementation may improve bactericidal function of neutrophils by increasing \nboth phagocytosis and ROI production. In conclusion, glutamine plays an \nimportant role in neutrophil function. Glutamine may be useful for the \nprevention, and treatment, of severe infection in critical illness and trauma.\n\nDOI: 10.1177/014860719902300515\nPMID: 10483897 [Indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n</observation>"
