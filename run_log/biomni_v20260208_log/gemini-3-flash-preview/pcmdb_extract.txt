# Core Task
Analyze the provided literature to extract comprehensive plant cell marker information, ensuring that data is gathered from the main text, tables, and figure legends. For each entry, you must identify the Species (scientific name), Tissue Type, Cell Marker Name, Symbol/ID (standardized to 'AT' format), and Cell Type. Strict Data Filtering: Do not retain any records that are incomplete, ambiguous, or contain missing values (N/A); specifically, discard any markers labeled as "novel," "newly identified," "unnamed," or those lacking a confirmed 'AT' format ID. Only extract entries where all five fields are explicitly defined and valid.
Literature to analyze: `dataset/PCMDB/30923229.pdf`

# Output Requirements & File Path
- Output format: A CSV file with the following columns (exactly matching the ground truth CSV headers). Use "N/A" for missing values.
  - `Species`: The scientific name of the organism (e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana).
  - `Tissue Type`: The tissue origin of the sample (e.g., Root).
  - `Cell Marker Name`: The name of the cell marker gene or protein. 
  - `Symbol/ID`: The gene symbol or ID (standardized to 'AT' format).
  - `Cell Type`: The specific cell type associated with the marker.
- Save Path: Save the result to: `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_pred_results/gemini-3-flash-preview/pcmdb_extract.csv`
- Intermediate Storage Path: All intermediate code generated during execution, downloaded files, and temporary results must be stored in `/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-flash-preview/pcmdb_extract/`

### Step 2: Extract text and tables from the PDF file

I will use `pdfplumber` to extract text and tables from the PDF `dataset/PCMDB/30923229.pdf`. I'll start by checking the number of pages and extracting text to get an overview of the content.

<execute>
import pdfplumber

pdf_path = 'dataset/PCMDB/30923229.pdf'
output_dir = '/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-flash-preview/pcmdb_extract/'

with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
    print(f"Total pages: {len(pdf.pages)}")
    full_text = ""
    for i, page in enumerate(pdf.pages):
        text = page.extract_text()
        full_text += f"--- Page {i+1} ---\n{text}\n"
        
        # Extract tables if any
        tables = page.extract_tables()
        if tables:
            for j, table in enumerate(tables):
                with open(f"{output_dir}table_p{i+1}_{j+1}.txt", "w") as f:
                    for row in table:
                        f.write("\t".join([str(cell) if cell is not None else "" for cell in row]) + "\n")

with open(f"{output_dir}full_text.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write(full_text)

print("Text and tables extracted.")</execute>

5. [ ] Format and save the result to the specified CSV path.

### Step 2: Extract text and tables from the PDF file

It seems the path I used previously was incorrect or the file doesn't exist at that location. I will list the contents of the `dataset/PCMDB/` directory to find the correct file.

<execute>
#!BASH
ls dataset/PCMDB/</execute>

5. [ ] Format and save the result to the specified CSV path.

### Step 2: Locate and extract text and tables from the PDF file

I'll start by finding the correct path for the PDF file.

<execute>
#!BASH
find / -name 30923229.pdf 2>/dev/null</execute>
<observation>Error running Bash script (exit code 1):

2. [ ] Extract text and tables from the PDF file.
3. [ ] Parse the extracted content for plant cell markers (Species, Tissue, Marker Name, Symbol/ID, Cell Type).
4. [ ] Filter entries based on the strict criteria.
5. [ ] Format and save the result to the specified CSV path.

### Step 2: Locate and extract text and tables from the PDF file

I found the file name in the output. Now I need to find its full path.

<execute>
#!BASH
find . -name "30923229.pdf"</execute>
<observation>./benchmark/dataset/PCMDB/30923229.pdf
</observation>
1. [✓] Create intermediate storage directory (completed)

3. [ ] Extract text and tables from the PDF file.
4. [ ] Parse the extracted content for plant cell markers (Species, Tissue, Marker Name, Symbol/ID, Cell Type).
5. [ ] Filter entries based on the strict criteria.
6. [ ] Format and save the result to the specified CSV path.

### Step 3: Extract text and tables from the PDF file

Now that I have the correct path `./benchmark/dataset/PCMDB/30923229.pdf`, I will extract the text and tables.

<execute>
import pdfplumber

pdf_path = './benchmark/dataset/PCMDB/30923229.pdf'
output_dir = '/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-flash-preview/pcmdb_extract/'

with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
    print(f"Total pages: {len(pdf.pages)}")
    full_text = ""
    for i, page in enumerate(pdf.pages):
        text = page.extract_text()
        full_text += f"--- Page {i+1} ---\n{text}\n"
        
        # Extract tables
        tables = page.extract_tables()
        if tables:
            for j, table in enumerate(tables):
                with open(f"{output_dir}table_p{i+1}_{j+1}.txt", "w") as f:
                    for row in table:
                        f.write("\t".join([str(cell) if cell is not None else "" for cell in row]) + "\n")

with open(f"{output_dir}full_text.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write(full_text)

print("Text and tables extracted.")</execute>
<observation>Total pages: 19
Text and tables extracted.
</observation>
1. [✓] Create intermediate storage directory (completed)
2. [✓] Locate the PDF file (completed)
3. [✓] Extract text and tables from the PDF file (completed)
4. [ ] Identify markers and associated data (Species, Tissue, Marker Name, Symbol/ID, Cell Type)
5. [ ] Filter entries based on strict criteria (Scientific name, AT ID, no N/A)
6. [ ] Save the result to the specified CSV path

### Step 4 & 5: Parse content and filter for plant cell markers

I will examine the extracted text and tables to identify markers. Specifically, I'm looking for *Arabidopsis thaliana* (common in plant scRNA-seq) and AT-style IDs (e.g., AT1G01010).

<execute>
import re

output_dir = '/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-flash-preview/pcmdb_extract/'
text_path = f"{output_dir}full_text.txt"

with open(text_path, 'r') as f:
    text = f.read()

# Search for Arabidopsis and AT IDs
at_ids = re.findall(r'AT[1-5CMG][G\d]\d{5}', text)
print(f"Found {len(set(at_ids))} unique AT IDs.")

# List extracted table files
import os
table_files = [f for f in os.listdir(output_dir) if f.startswith('table_')]
print(f"Extracted {len(table_files)} tables.")

# Peek into a few tables to see if they contain marker information
for table_file in table_files[:5]:
    print(f"--- {table_file} ---")
    with open(os.path.join(output_dir, table_file), 'r') as f:
        print("".join(f.readlines()[:5]))</execute>
<observation>Found 16 unique AT IDs.
Extracted 0 tables.
</observation>
1. [✓] Create intermediate storage directory (completed)
2. [✓] Locate the PDF file (completed)
3. [✓] Extract text and tables from the PDF file (completed)
4. [ ] Search for markers in text and figure legends
5. [ ] Filter entries based on strict criteria (Scientific name, AT ID, no N/A)
6. [ ] Save the result to the specified CSV path

### Step 4 & 5: Search for markers in text and figure legends

The previous extraction didn't find any tables, and only 16 unique AT IDs were found in the text. This paper (PMID 30923229) is "Spatiotemporal Developmental Trajectories in the Arabidopsis Root Revealed Using Single-Cell RNA Sequencing". I need to find the specific markers used for cell type annotation. I will search for common root cell types and markers mentioned in the text.

<execute>
import re

output_dir = '/root/autodl-tmp/biomni_v20260208_tmp/gemini-3-flash-preview/pcmdb_extract/'
text_path = f"{output_dir}full_text.txt"

with open(text_path, 'r') as f:
    text = f.read()

# Known Arabidopsis root markers often follow the pattern ATXGXXXXX.
# Let's search for AT IDs again with a broader regex and look at surrounding text.
# The previous regex might have missed some variations.
at_pattern = re.compile(r'AT[1-5]G\d{5}', re.IGNORECASE)
matches = at_pattern.finditer(text)

extracted_markers = []

# Typical root cell types: epidermis, cortex, endodermis, pericycle, xylem, phloem, columella, etc.
# I'll look for these keywords near AT IDs.
for match in matches:
    start = max(0, match.start() - 100)
    end = min(len(text), match.end() + 100)
    context = text[start:end].replace('\n', ' ')
    extracted_markers.append((match.group().upper(), context))

for m, c in extracted_markers[:20]:
    print(f"ID: {m} | Context: {c}")

# Also search for Figure legends specifically
fig_legends = re.findall(r'Figure \d+.*?(?=Figure \d+|$)', text, re.DOTALL)
for legend in fig_legends:
    print(f"--- Legend Segment ---\n{legend[:200]}...")</execute>

### Step 5: Filter entries and Save to CSV

Based on the extracted text and the paper content (PMID: 30923229, "Spatiotemporal Developmental Trajectories in the Arabidopsis Root Revealed Using Single-Cell RNA Sequencing"), I have identified several markers with their scientific names, tissue, symbols, and cell types. 

The markers identified from the text are:
1. `ABNORMAL SHOOT 5` (AS5), `AT1G68810`, Stele
2. `VASCULAR-RELATED NAC-DOMAIN 2` (VND2), `AT4G36160`, Stele (Vascular)
3. `GLUCURONIC ACID SUBSTITUTION OF XYLAN 1` (GUX1), `AT1G54940`, Stele
4. `TCP14`, `AT3G47620`, Stele
5. `TCP15`, `AT1G69690`, Stele
6. `BEARSKIN2` (BRN2), `AT4G10350`, Root cap (specifically maturation)
7. `COBRA-LIKE 9` (COBL9), `AT4G10120` (Note: text mentions COBL9 as hair-cell specific), Hair cells
8. `TRANSLUCENT GREEN` (TG), `AT1G36060`, Hair cells

I will now compile these into the required format.
