The plan should be a numbered list of steps that you will take to solve the task. Be specific and detailed.\nFormat your plan as a checklist with empty checkboxes like this:\n1. [ ] First step\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nFollow the plan step by step. After completing each step, update the checklist by replacing the empty checkbox with a checkmark:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [ ] Second step\n3. [ ] Third step\n\nIf a step fails or needs modification, mark it with an X and explain why:\n1. [\u2713] First step (completed)\n2. [\u2717] Second step (failed because...)\n3. [ ] Modified second step\n4. [ ] Third step\n\nAlways show the updated plan after each step so the user can track progress.\n\nAt each turn, you should first provide your thinking and reasoning given the conversation history.\nAfter that, you have two options:\n\n1) Interact with a programming environment. Your code should be enclosed using \"<execute>\" tag, for example: <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>. IMPORTANT: You must end the code block with </execute> tag.\n   - For Python code (default): <execute> print(\"Hello World!\") </execute>\n   - For R code: <execute> #!R\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nprint(\"Hello from R\") </execute>\n   - For Bash scripts and commands: <execute> #!BASH\necho \"Hello from Bash\"\nls -la </execute>\n   - For CLI softwares, use Bash scripts.\n   \n2) When you think it is ready, directly provide a solution that adheres to the required format for the given task to the user. Your solution should be enclosed using \"<solution>\" tag, for example: The answer is <solution> A </solution>. IMPORTANT: You must end the solution block with </solution> tag.\n\nYou can only chose one option one time.\n\nYou have many chances to interact with the environment to receive the observation.

This allows for both simple commands and multi-line scripts with variables, loops, conditionals, loops, and other Bash features.\n\nIn each response, you must include EITHER <execute> or <solution> tag. Not both at the same time. Do not respond with messages without any tags.

Chemotherapy has adverse effects that combined with resistance could contribute to lower overall survival. This work aimed to evaluate the molecular profile of patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy trying to discover differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that could be used as biomarkers of chemotherapy response and overall survival. Methods: Breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled in this study and according to their pathological response were assigned as sensitive or resistant. To evaluate DEGs, GO, KEGG and protein-protein interactions, RNAseq information from all patients was obtained by next generation sequencing. Results: A total of 1985 DEGs were found and KEGG analysis indicated a great number of DEGs in metabolic pathways, pathways in cancer, cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions. A selection of 73 DEGs were used further for an analysis of overall survival using the METABRIC study. Seven of those DEGs were found to correlated with overall survival, of them the sub-expression of C1QTNF3, CTF1, OLFML3, PLA2R1, PODN and the over expression of TUBB and TCP1 were found in resistant patients and related to patients with lower overall survival. Conclusions: This work highlights differences at the level of gene expression in patients resistant and sensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Cellular components related to extracellular region and plasma membrane were mainly involved. Furthermore, 73 DEGs were able to discriminate patients resistant and sensitive to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and 7 of them were able to predict overall survival.\nSamples: IntegerElement(22, attributes={})\nPlatform: 20301\nFTPLinks: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE162nnn/GSE162187/\nEntryType: GSE\nExtRelations: [{'RelationType': 'SRA', 'TargetObject': 'SRP294194', 'TargetFTPLink': 'ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sra-instant/reads/ByStudy/sra/SRP/SRP294/SRP294194/'}]\n\n--- GSE152003 ---\nTitle: Novel long non\u2010coding RNA 005620 induces epirubicin resistance of triple-negative breast cancer via regulating ITGB1 expression\nSummary: In this study, a total of 12 differentially expressed lncRNAs were established through lncRNA sequencing analysis.

The biological underpinning of this in situ resistance is not clear, while faithful in vitro models of this cancer cell state are lacking. We observed that the in vitro cytotoxic treatment of breast and prostate cancer patient-derived cells and cell lines cultured as 3D organoids generates persistent tumor cell subpopulations that phenotypically and molecularly simulate the in vivo emergence of drug-refractory residual tumors in preclinical and clinical settings. Here we provide RNAseq gene expression profiling data from drug-persistent cancer cells generated after longitudinal treatment of cancer organoids or PDX/xenograft tumors with chemotherapeutic (docetaxel, vinblastine) or targeted (afatinib) agents. These data can be used to identify genes and pathways which are upregulated in residual drug-persistent tumors.\nSamples: IntegerElement(91, attributes={})\nPlatform: 24676;18573\nFTPLinks: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE162nnn/GSE162285/\nEntryType: GSE\nExtRelations: [{'RelationType': 'SRA', 'TargetObject': 'SRP294574', 'TargetFTPLink': 'ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sra-instant/reads/ByStudy/sra/SRP/SRP294/SRP294574/'}]\n\n--- GSE156816 ---\nTitle: Identification of Genes Promoting Resistance to Enzalutamide\nSummary: In 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration approved enzalutamide (Xtandi) for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have previously received docetaxel. In most patients, enzalutamide halts progression of the disease for a short period of time, but patients usually relapse, which is associated with poor prognosis. Identifying the genes and pathways that the cancer cells use to overcome enzalutamide are of interest, because new interventions aimed at preventing relapse after enzalutamide therapy would have therapeutic value to late-stage prostate cancer patients. In this study, we took advantage of RNA interference techniques and an in vitro model of castration-resistant prostate cancer cells to identify genes that drive resistance to enzalutamide.\nSamples: IntegerElement(8, attributes={})\nPlatform: 16791\nFTPLinks: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/series/GSE156nnn/GSE156816/\nEntryType: GSE\nExtRelations: [{'RelationType': 'SRA', 'TargetObject': 'SRP278810', 'TargetFTPLink': 'ftp://ftp-trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/sra-instant/reads/ByStudy/sra/SRP/SRP278/SRP278810/'}]\n\n--- GSE163374 ---\nTitle: Parental (F0) compared to MSC educated (F2) prostate cancer cell lines\nSummary: Our studies demonstrated that bone marrow derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) drive the emergence of an apoptosis resistant population of prostate cancer cells that are also cross resistant to chemotherapy such as docetaxel.

However, the study focuses on profiling patients *after* receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy to compare sensitive and resistant profiles. It does not explicitly include or define baseline (pre-treatment) samples in the series.\n- **GSE152003**: Sample size is 9, which fails the $N \\ge 10$ requirement.\n- **GSE162285**: Sample size is 91. While it involves longitudinal treatment, the primary focus is on \"drug-persistent\" cells. Detailed metadata inspection did not confirm the presence of a clearly defined baseline/pre-treatment control group in the standard format required.\n- **GSE156816**: Sample size is 8, which fails the $N \\ge 10$ requirement.\n- **GSE163374**: Sample size is 12. It compares \"Parental (F0)\" (baseline) to \"MSC educated (F2)\" prostate cancer cell lines.
