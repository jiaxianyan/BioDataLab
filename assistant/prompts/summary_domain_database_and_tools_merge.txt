# ABSTRACT  

Temporal and spatial protein phosphorylation dynamically orchestrates a broad spectrum of biological processes and plays various physiological and pathological roles in diseases and cancers. Recent advancements in high-throughput proteomics techniques greatly promoted the profiling and quantification of phosphoproteome. However, although several comprehensive databases have reserved the phosphorylated proteins and sites, a resource for phosphorylation quantification still remains to be constructed. In this study, we developed the qPhos (http://qphos.cancerbio.info) database to integrate and host the data on phosphorylation dynamics. A total of 3 537 533 quantification events for 199 071 non-redundant phosphorylation sites on 18 402 proteins under 484 conditions were collected through exhaustive curation of published literature. The experimental details, including sample materials, conditions and methods, were recorded. Various annotations, such as protein sequence and structure properties, potential upstream kinases and their inhibitors, were systematically integrated and carefully organized to present details about the quantified phosphorylation sites. Various browse and search functions were implemented for the user-defined filtering of samples, conditions and proteins. Furthermore, the qKinAct service was developed to dissect the kinase activity profile from user-submitted quantitative phosphoproteome data through annotating the kinase activity-related phosphorylation sites. Taken together, the qPhos database provides a comprehensive resource for protein phosphorylation dynamics to facilitate related investigations.  

# INTRODUCTION  

As one of the most important post-translational modifications (PTMs), protein phosphorylation is involved in almost all biological processes and plays physiological and pathological roles in diseases and cancers (1–3). Phosphorylation is reversibly catalysed by kinases and phosphatases, which dynamically control the phosphorylation dynamics based on a temporal and spatial context (4,5). In 1992, Edmond H. Fischer and Edwin G. Krebs shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of reversible protein phosphorylation as a biological regulatory mechanism (6), while the prize in 2001 was awarded to Leland H. Hartwell, Tim Hunt and Paul M. Nurse for identifying key regulators, including cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclins, which accurately orchestrate the cell cycle through phosphorylation (7). In recent decades, many studies have dissected the molecular mechanisms and biological functions of phosphorylation dynamics, and kinases and phosphatases are popular research areas for the development of target therapies (5,8).  

Recently, the advancement of high-throughput proteomics techniques greatly promoted the profiling and quantification of the phosphoproteome in various cells and tissues under different conditions (9,10). For example, based on phosphoproteome quantification, Wojcechowskyj et al. dissected the molecular mechanism of cellular reprogramming during HIV-1 entry (11), and van den Biggelaar et al. unveiled the dynamic phosphorylation of thrombin signalling in human primary endothelial cells (12). Since dynamic phosphorylation events could provide helpful clues for kinase-mediated signalling, Ho et al. identified the activation of PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 signalling for cell survival by the ELABELA peptide in human embryonic stem cells during heart development (13), Bai et al. profiled the driver tyrosine kinases in sarcoma (14) and Casado et al. inferred the aberrant kinase activation in leukaemia cells through the quantitative phosphoproteome-based computational analyses (15). Thus, the quantitative phosphoproteomics data could provide great help in understanding phosphorylation-controlled biological processes.  

Previously, several pioneering studies have contributed to constructing resources to host phosphorylation-related data. The currently available databases contain many human protein phosphorylation data. UniProt (16) is the most important infrastructure for protein annotations, which contain massive experimentally identified phosphorylation sites and annotations in the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) (17) also contain protein phosphorylation information. Databases including dbPTM (18), PhosphoSitePlus (19), SysPTM (20), PHOSIDA (21), dbPAF (22), Phospho.ELM (23) and PhosphoPep (24) curate and host experimentally identified phosphorylation sites from the published literature, and iPTMnet (25) contains information on the phosphorylation regulatory network and conservation. Furthermore, the PhosSNP (27) and ActiveDriverDB (28) databases analyse the genetic variations that influence phosphorylation, and the PTMcode (26) database provides the functional associations of phosphorylation sites. With the continuous improvement of highthroughput phosphoproteome techniques and the rapid increase of phosphoproteome datasets, ProteomeScout (29) and ProteomicsDB (30) were developed to store proteome and PTM proteome datasets and provide online analysis tools. However, although the ProteomeScout database contains protein quantification information, the quantification of phosphorylation events is still missing. Taken together, although databases for various aspects of protein phosphorylation are available, the database for the quantification of phosphorylation is still absent. Since the quantification/stoichiometry/dynamics of phosphorylation are critical for the molecular mechanisms under different temporal and spatial contexts, a comprehensive resource for protein phosphorylation quantification could facilitate the reuse of published quantitative phosphoproteome datasets and provide great help for phosphorylationrelated studies.  

In this study, we developed the qPhos database to host the quantitative phosphoproteome data generated in Homo sapiens. In total, 3 537 533 quantification events for 199 071 non-redundant phosphorylation sites on 18 402 proteins under 484 conditions were curated and integrated into the database, coupled with various annotations such as sequence and structure properties, potential upstream kinases and their inhibitors. For convenient usage, browse and search functions were implemented and the information in the database was carefully organized. Furthermore, based on curated activity-related phosphorylation sites, the qKinAct service was developed to dissect the kinase activity profile from phosphoproteome data. Thus, qPhos could serve as a one-stop database to investigate phosphorylation dynamics in $H.$ . sapiens.  

# CONSTRUCTION AND CONTENT  

To establish the resource for protein phosphorylation dynamics, the published quantitative phosphoproteomics datasets were collected from the literature and annotations from various resource were integrated (Figure 1). Keywords including ‘phosphoproteomic’, ‘phosphoproteomics’ and ‘phosphoproteome’ were used to search PubMed to retrieve the phosphoproteome-related literature. Based on the criteria of high-throughput mass spectrometry-based site-level protein phosphorylation quantification, the published datasets of quantitative phosphoproteome datasets in $H.$ . sapiens were manually curated. Besides the quantified phosphorylation sites, details about the quantification including the experimental condition, phosphopeptide enrichment method, mass spectrometry and raw peptide were collected. All quantified phosphopeptides and modified residues were mapped to the $H.$ sapiens reference proteome sequences downloaded from UniProt database (Release 2018 04) (Figure 1) (16). Due to the differences among the miscellaneous reference proteome datasets used in these literature, about $4.31\%$ of raw phosphopeptides could not be mapped to the UniProt reference human proteome, and these limited unmapped data was dropped. In addition, the annotations from databases such as UniProt (16), ExPASy (31) and DrugBank (Release 2018 07) (32) were integrated into the qPhos database to provide comprehensive information for phosphorylation events (Figure 1). The experimental verified kinase–substrate relationships were integrated from Phospho.ELM (23), PhosphoSitePlus (19) and MusiteDeep (33), and potential relationship were predicted by sequence-based predictor GPS (34) and networkbased predictor iGPS (35) with a high threshold (Figure 1). Furthermore, the activity-related phosphorylation sites in kinases were also curated from the literature. The human kinases and their names were retrieved from the EKPD database (36), and coupled with keywords including ‘phosphorylation’ and ‘activity or activate or activation’ to search PubMed for experimental evidence of activity-related phosphorylation (Figure 1).  

In total, 3 537 533 quantification events for 199 071 nonredundant phosphorylation sites on 18 402 proteins under 484 conditions were collected from 190 published studies. The primary references for the data were provided to ensure their quality and repeatability, and various annotations were integrated into the database. The sequence and structure preferences of the quantified phosphorylation sites were presented in Figure 2A–D. It seemed that the phosphorylation sites were generally equally distributed among the protein sequences but slightly enriched in C-terminal areas (E-ratio $=1.06$ , $P$ -value $<1\dot{0}^{-17}$ ) (Figure 2A). Through computational annotation of secondary structures, surface accessibility and disorder region by NetSurfP (37) and IUPred (38), it was observed that the phosphorylation sites were enriched in the coil region (E-ratio $=1.21$ , $P_{\l}$ -value $<10^{-18}$ ) (Figure 2B), exposed region (E-ratio $=1.21$ , $P-$ - value $<1\dot{0}^{-1\widetilde{8}}$ ) (Figure 2C) and disordered region (E-ratio $=2.09$ , $P$ -value $<10^{-18}$ ) (Figure 2D). As shown in Figure 2E, the distribution of phosphorylated serine, threonine and tyrosine residues was consistent with previous studies (19,22). Furthermore, the potential upstream kinases were annotated for these phosphorylation sites by various resources. The experimentally identified kinase-site regulatory relations were retrieved from previous studies, including Phospho.ELM (23), PhosphoSitePlus (19) and MusiteDeep (33). Additionally, the potential site-specific kinasesubstrate relationships were predicted by sequence-based predictor GPS (34) and network-based predictor iGPS (35) with a high threshold. The annotations of kinases were summarized at the family level in Figure 2F.

# USAGE  

The qPhos database was developed for scientists to quickly access the quantitative phosphoproteome data in a userfriendly manner. For convenient usage, qPhos provided browse and search functions to query the database. Three browse options, including condition, sample and gene, were provided to browse the database by selecting the item from the list (Figure 3A). The experimental conditions, samples including cell lines and tissues, and gene symbols were sorted and organized in alphabetical order, which enabled the users to quickly choose the interesting data (Figure 3A). Simple and complex search functions were implemented at the home (Figure 3B) and search (Figure 3C) pages, respectively, which provided keyword-based queries in protein and gene names, protein functions and descriptions of conditions and samples. Furthermore, the retrieved phosphorylation sites from the browse or search functions could be further filtered by conditions, samples and methods in the results page (Figure 3D).  

In the results page, the information was organized by the quantification events in a tabular format with UniProt accession, gene name, position, sequence window, sample information, sample type, experimental condition, quantification method, log2-transformed ratio and $P$ -value (Figure 3D). Users could click the plus button to view the detailed information about the protein and phosphorylation sites. The detailed information had four sections, including ‘About experiment’, ‘Potential kinases and their inhibitors’, ‘Sequence and structure’ and ‘About protein’ (Figure 3E– I). The detailed description of the condition, raw quantifications, source reference, experimental method and instrument and raw peptide were shown in the ‘About Experiment’ section (Figure 3E). ‘Potential kinases and their inhibitors’ showed the experimental identified and predicted upstream kinases for the phosphorylation site (Figure 3F). Furthermore, the inhibitors annotated by DrugBank for the kinases were shown (Figure 3F). The sequence and structure properties of the protein were visualized in the ‘Sequence and Structure’ section, which included the quantified phosphorylation sites, activity-related phosphorylation sites if the protein was a kinase, disorder region, secondary structure and surface accessibility (Figure 3G). A magnifier was implemented to show the details by enlarging the selected region (Figure 3G). Furthermore, users could access descriptions about visualization by hovering over the content (Figure 3I). The ‘About Protein’ section presented the protein information including database accessions, protein/gene name/alias, functional descriptions, PTMs and sequences adopted from the UniProt database (Figure 3H).

Since autophosphorylation or phosphorylation of the specified segment could activate or inactivate the kinases (39), the identification and quantification of these activityrelated phosphorylation sites could indicate the activation status of these kinases. Through exhaustive curation of literature, we collected the experimentally identified activityrelated phosphorylation sites for the human kinome. In total, 829 activity-related phosphorylation sites were curated in 272 kinases (Figure 4A), which covered over half of the kinome. Among the activity-related phosphorylation sites, nearly half were autophosphorylation sites. Most autophosphorylation sites could activate the kinases, while seven autophosphorylation sites could inactivate the kinases. Furthermore, most activity-related phosphorylation sites were positively related to the activities of the kinase, while only a small fraction were negatively related (Figure 4A). The distributions of activity-related phosphorylation sites among kinases and kinase families were summarized in Figure 4B and C, respectively. The qKinAct service was developed to query the quantification events of activity-related phosphorylation sites to annotate the kinase activity profile from quantitative phosphoproteome data (Figure 4D). The activity-related phosphorylation sites could be annotated through straightforward submission of the identified phosphorylated peptide and their quantifications (Figure 4E).  

Here, we provide two examples to show the application of the qKinAct service for kinase activity analysis. Paulo et al. globally analysed the phosphorylation dynamics in nicotine-treated pancreatic stellate cells and discovered the intensive dysregulation of protein phosphorylation in transcriptional events and nuclear function in response to nicotine (40). The kinase activity-related phosphorylation sites were analysed by qKinAct and shown in Figure 4F. It was observed that the phosphorylation level of activity-related phosphorylation sites was aberrant for kinases such as BRAF, PRKCB $(\mathrm{PKC}\upbeta)$ ), PRKAA2 (AMPK) and EGFR. Interestingly, previous studies have identified the aberrant activation of EGFR (41) and PRKAA2 (42,43) induced by cigarette smoke. Moreover, the qKinAct analysis of ${\mathrm{TNF}}\upalpha$ -stimulated phosphorylation dynamics quantified by Mohideen et al. (44) identified ten aberrant activityrelated phosphorylation sites for kinases such as PDPK1 (PDK1), GSK3, DYRK1 and RIPK1 (Figure 4G). Among the results, the observed inactivation of RIPK1 by S320 phosphorylation was also validated by their experiments (44). Thus, the qKinAct service could quickly provide helpful kinase activity profiles to elucidate the dynamics of phosphorylation signalling pathways regulated by kinases.

# DISCUSSION  

Protein phosphorylation occurs frequently over numerous biological processes, such as cell proliferation and differentiation, transcriptional activation and metabolic homeostasis (1–7). As one of the most important PTMs, phosphorylation greatly expands the complexity and diversity of proteome (1), while aberrant phosphorylation disorders the signalling pathways and is intensively correlated with diseases and cancers (2–5). The advancement of phosphoproteomic techniques greatly facilitated the high-throughput profiling and quantification of phosphorylation events and the accumulation of massive phosphoproteome data (9,10). However, although a number of systematic studies have contributed to recording the phosphorylation sites (16–30), their quantitative dynamics were still stored in the literature. qPhos is the first repository to curate phosphorylation dynamics data. Various annotations, including protein information, potential upstream kinases and their inhibitors, and sequence and structure properties, were integrated to annotate the phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, the qKinAct service was developed to dissect the kinase activity profile from user-submitted quantitative phosphoproteome data through direct annotations of activity-related phosphorylation sites for kinases. Meanwhile, there were also various limitations in the database. The database was focused on human health-related phosphorylation dynamics, and currently only data from human tissues and cell lines were collected. However, several quantitative phosphoproteomics studies were based on a mouse model or other model organisms (45), which also provided helpful clues for medical investigations. Furthermore, previous studies showed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and somatic mutations at or around the phosphorylation sites could affect the phosphorylation dynamics (27), and currently qPhos has not linked the phosphorylation sites to the large quantity of SNP and mutation data. Taken together, although improvements remain to be achieved, qPhos could serve as a comprehensive resource to enable researchers to systematically and conveniently access the phosphorylation dynamics data under different experimental conditions, and its qKinAct service could help users to easily analyse the kinase activity profile from their own quantitative phosphoproteome data. The qPhos database will be regularly updated to keep pace with the progress of the quantitative dynamics of phosphorylation.

# ABSTRACT  

Gene fusion is one of the hallmarks of cancer genome via chromosomal rearrangement initiated by DNA double-strand breakage. To date, many fusion genes (FGs) have been established as important biomarkers and therapeutic targets in multiple cancer types. To better understand the function of FGs in cancer types and to promote the discovery of clinically relevant FGs, we built FusionGDB (Fusion Gene annotation DataBase) available at https://ccsm.uth.edu/FusionGDB. We collected 48 117 FGs across pan-cancer from three representative fusion gene resources: the improved database of chimeric transcripts and RNA-seq data (ChiTaRS 3.1), an integrative resource for cancerassociated transcript fusions (TumorFusions), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) fusions by Gao e al. For these $\sim48\mathsf{K}$ FGs, we performed functional annotations including gene assessment across pancancer fusion genes, open reading frame (ORF) assignment, and retention search of 39 protein features based on gene structures of multiple isoforms with different breakpoints. We also provided the fusion transcript and amino acid sequences according to multiple breakpoints and transcript isoforms. Our analyses identified 331, 303 and 667 in-frame FGs with retaining kinase, DNA-binding, and epigenetic factor domains, respectively, as well as 976 FGs lost protein-protein interaction. FusionGDB provides six categories of annotations: FusionGeneSummary, FusionProtFeature, FusionGeneSequence, FusionGenePPI, RelatedDrug and RelatedDisease.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Gene fusion is one of the hallmark of cancer genome through chromosomal rearrangements triggered by DNA double-strand breakage. Accordingly, many fusion genes (FGs) have been identified as important biomarkers and therapeutic targets in multiple cancer types. Identification and analysis of fusion genes (FGs) will provide important insights into the mechanisms of cancer development and design novel therapeutic strategies (1). With the exponential growth of cancer genomic and other biomedical data, several studies have integrated and searched fusion genes across multiple cancer types (e.g. pan-cancer studies). The improved database of chimeric transcripts and RNA-seq data (ChiTaRS 3.1) provided 20 131 human breakpoints from expressed sequence tags (EST) (2). Since the TCGA database was open to the public, four research groups have been working on predicting FGs and tried to identify driver FGs from this dataset. Stransky et al. predicted fusion genes involving kinases across 20 cancer types from $\sim7000$ TCGA samples (3). In this study, the authors filtered out the FGs that were also detected in normal samples of TCGA and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. Their studies suggested that $3.0\%$ of tumor samples contained likely oncogenic, recurrent kinase fusion genes. ChimerDB 3.0 has an enhanced coverage of fusion gene data through literature mining using machine learning method (4) and provided 30K FG pairs by analyzing RNA-seq data of 5300 TCGA samples across 28 cancer types. TumorFusions, an integrative resource for cancer-associated transcript fusions, predicted FGs from 9966 TCGA samples across 33 cancer types (5). They applied stringent criteria and resulted in ${\sim}21\mathrm{K}$ FGs. Most recently, Gao et al. selected FGs called from at least two callers and predicted in $\sim26\mathrm{K}$ FGs from 9624 TCGA samples of 33 cancer types (6).  

Although above studies have provided a huge amount of reliable FGs, such resources did not present detailed functional annotation of individual FGs. In addition, the identification of driver FGs was solely based on the kinase FGs. So far, a systematic annotation of FGs in cancer regarding the retention of diverse functional domains and protein features, which are important in understanding cellular process and tumorigenesis, has not been available. In this study, we investigated the retention of 39 protein features of 43 895 FGs with ORF annotation and identified 331, 303, 840 and 667 in-frame FGs with retaining kinase domain, DNA-binding domain, oncogene domains, and epigenetic factor (epifactor) domains, respectively. Furthermore, we identified 896 and 118 in-frame FGs that did not retain their functional domains of tumor suppressor genes and DNA damage repair genes, respectively. In contrast, there were 6863 FGs with domain retention, but they lost their function due to the frame-shift ORF by chromosomal rearrangement. We also analyzed the retention information for protein-protein interaction (PPI) in fusion protein. Such analysis can provide fusion gene candidates who lose important interactions with cellular regulators. Through this analysis, we identified 718 and 976 FGs with PPI retention and without PPI retention, respectively. 761 FGs have no PPI functionalities due to ORF frameshifts. Since the identification and browsing of FGs for analysis and validation are based on the exact genomic breakpoints, obtaining accurate fusion transcript and fusion amino acid sequences are very important for further studies in both of the dry- and wet-lab, and are urgent needs for many cancer researchers. However, the exact fusion transcript or fusion amino acid sequences of all existing fusion genes considering multiple isoforms and breakpoints are not available. We have created these fusion sequences based on the genomic breakpoints at the Ensembl gene isoform structures (7).  

Here, we give a detailed introduction of the FusionGDB (Fusion Gene annotation DataBase), including the web interface and its applications. Our database includes features of all human FGs based on large cancer dataset analysis using systematic bioinformatics approaches, providing resources or references for functional annotation of fusion genes. FusionGDB will be a unique resource of cancer research for understanding the mechanisms of cancer development and identifying potential therapeutic targets against cancer.  

# DATABASE OVERVIEW  

We first collected 48 117 FGs across pan-cancer from three representative fusion gene resources: the improved database of chimeric transcripts and RNA-seq data (ChiTaRS 3.1) (2), an integrative resource for cancerassociated transcript fusions (TumorFusions) (5) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) fusions by Gao et al. (6) (Supplementary Table S1). For these ${\sim}48\mathrm{K}$ FGs, we performed functional annotations including gene assessment across pan-cancer fusion genes, open reading frame (ORF) assignment, and protein domain retention searches based on multiple isoform gene structures and breakpoints, and finally provided the fusion transcripts and amino acid sequences for each breakpoint and gene isoforms (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table S2 and S3 (https://ccsm.uth.edu/FusionGDB/tables/TableS2.zip, https://ccsm.uth.edu/FusionGDB/tables/TableS3A.zip, and https://ccsm.uth.edu/FusionGDB/tables/TableS3B. zip)). For each fusion partner gene, the user can access multiple annotations such as gene summary, assessment scores of each gene in pan-cancer, biological process gene ontologies, functional description, and retention information of 39 protein features from UniProt (8) and protein–protein interaction (PPI), related drugs and diseases through six categories. Among ${\sim}44\mathrm{K}$ FGs, which were checked ORFs, there were $\sim10\mathrm{K}$ in-frame FGs and ${\sim}11\mathrm{K}$ frameshift FGs. Of these, we identified 331, 303, 840 and 667 in-frame  

FGs with retained kinase, DNA-binding, oncogene and epigenetic effector domains. In addition, we identified 896 and 118 in-frame FGs that do not retain their functional domains of tumor suppressor genes and DNA damage repair genes, respectively. 6863 FGs with reserved functional domains have no functionalities due to frameshifts (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table S3A and S3B). We also investigated the retention of PPI in FGs and found that 976 FGs have no retained PPI regions and 761 FGs lose PPIs due to ORF frameshifts. For the 175 highly recurrent FGs that have expressed in more than five samples, we performed manual curation of PubMed articles (Supplementary Table S4). All of these information is included in the database and downloadable with unique and efficient data formats.  

The main features of the FusionGDB annotations are summarized as follows. (i) The FusionGeneSummary category displays an overview of multiple annotations of fusion genes. Specifically, in this category, we added two genetic assessment scores, such as the Degree of Frequency (DoF) and the Major Active Isofusion Index (MAII), to provide the impact of each gene on pan-cancer gene fusions, which were created from previous studies (Supplementary Table S5A and B (9,10). Figure 2 shows the top-ranked impact genes for the ${5}^{\prime}$ -genes (Head genes or Hgenes) and $3^{\prime}.$ - genes (Tail genes or Tgenes) of pan-cancer FGs through our scoring system. Furthermore, this category also shows the assignment of functional classes of each fusion gene to help understand the tumorigenic mechanisms. (ii) FusionProtFeature category provides the retention information of 39 protein features of fusion proteins based on their multiple isoforms of gene structures and multiple breakpoints. Through focusing on the protein domains or regions of interest among the 39 features, users can understand more about the overall function of specific fusion genes and make a hypothesis/plan for further research on tumorigenesis. (iii) In the FusionGeneSequence category, we present full-length fusion transcript and coding region (CDS) sequences, and amino acid sequences based on the multiple breakpoints and matched gene isoforms. (iv) FusionGenePPI category provides protein–protein interaction (PPI) information of fusion proteins. This category also present a link to the chimeric protein-protein interaction (ChiPPI) (11) for users to get fusion domain networks. It also shows the list of interactors with each partner protein in wild-type to infer the original interactions. Specifically, this category provides retention annotations of PPIs for better understand the possible loss or gain of interactions with important cellular regulatory factors due to structural disruptions of gene fusion. (v) RelatedDrug and RelatedDisease categories are designed for providing FG related drugs and diseases. By using these two categories, we identified 1341 approved drugs for 1302 genes involved in 8423 FGs and 6169 genes associated with 4679 different types of diseases from DrugBank (12) and DisGeNet (13), respectively. The details of the data and analysis processes are described in the following section.  

Figure 1 and Table 1 summarize the overview of FG annotation and the overall statistics of protein feature retention status of ${\sim}48\mathrm{K}$ FGs. All entries and annotation data can be viewed and downloaded on the FusionGDB website with a unique and efficient visualization interface (https://ccsm.uth.edu/FusionGDB).

# DATA INTEGRATION AND ANNOTATIONS  

# Fusion gene information  

We downloaded breakpoint information of 17 860, 15 854 and 23 944 FGs and their related information from ChiTaRS 3.1(http://chitars.md.biu.ac.il/, January 2017), TumorFusions (http://www.tumorfusions.org, November 2017), and TCGA fusions (Gao et al., April 2018), respectively. Of these, 17 860 and 30 270 FGs were from Entrez Sanger sequences and TCGA samples. By integrating the above data, we obtained 48 117 unique FGs. For the genome coordinates information for fusion breakpoints from Gao et al. study, we lifted it over from the human reference genome  

GRCh38 to GRCh37 using Batch Coordinate Conversion (liftOver) utility from UCSC Genome Browser (14) to fit with the reference genome of the other two resources. The following FG information from these resources have been collected: sample ID or expressed sequence tag (EST) ID, the name of fusion partner gene and exon junction breakpoint. We followed the definition of FGs direction for the Hgene (Head gene or $5^{\prime}$ -gene) and Tgene (Tail gene or $3^{\prime}.$ - gene) to these datasets.  

# Manual curation of PubMed articles  

For the 175 highly recurrent FGs, which expressed in more than five samples or cells, a literature query of PubMed for individual FGs was conducted in July 2018. Using BCRABL1 as an example, it is ‘((BCR [Title/Abstract]) AND

Figure 2. Gene assessment across pan-cancer in-frame FGs. (A) ${5}^{\prime}$ -partner genes with high-MAII scores. (B) $3^{\prime}$ -Partner genes with high-MAII scores. Y-axis presents Major Active Iso-fusion Index (MAII) score. MAII score can be calculated by $\log_{2}$ (observed frequency/DoF score $\times~10\$ ). Degree of Frequency (DoF) score can be calculated by (# cancer types) $\times$ $\#$ partners) $\times$ (# breakpoints). The genes that have the positive and bigger values of MAIIs are ‘effective genes in pan-cancer fusion genes (eGinPCFG)’. The genes that have the negative and less values of MAIIs are ‘possible effective genes in pan-cancer fusion genes (peGinPCFG)’.  

ABL1 [Title/Abstract]) AND fusion [Title/Abstract])’. After a manual review of the abstracts, we found 85 FGs had literature evidence to support these FGs.  

# Open reading frame (ORF) annotation  

We examined the open reading frames of individual fusion transcript sequences between the ${5}^{\prime}.$ - and $3^{\prime}$ -partner genes. When both of the breakpoints in ${5}^{\prime}{.}$ - and $3^{\prime}$ -genes are located inside of coding region (CDS) and the number of fusion transcript sequences from the transcription start site of ${5}^{\prime}$ -gene to transcription end site of $3^{\prime}$ - gene is a multiple of three, then we reported such fusion genes as ‘in-frame’. If there is one or two nucleotide insertions, then we reported such FGs as ‘frame-shift’. Except these two types of ORFs, there are 15 more ORFs such as ‘3UTR-CDS’, ‘3UTR-3UTR’, ‘3UTR-5UTR’, ‘3UTR-intron’, ‘CDS-3UTR’, ‘CDS-5UTR’, ‘CDS-intron’, ‘5UTR-CDS’, ‘5UTR-3UTR’, ‘5UTR-5UTR’, ‘5UTRintron’, ‘intron-CDS’, ‘intron-3UTR’, ‘intron-5UTR’ and ‘intron-intron’. Here, the FGs are named ‘intron’, when the breakpoint is located 6bp apart from the exon junction site to the intron direction. Since our fusion breakpoints were derived from the ESTs and RNA-seq data, all the breakpoint should be located inside of the exon. Therefore, if the breakpoint is located on the intron in at least one of the partners, then we report it as ‘intron’. These categories are marked as not available (NA) ORF cases in our ORF classification. To do so, we took all matched Ensembl transcripts (ENSTs) into consideration (7). 37 900 and 40 109 breakpoints of 11 873 and 13 771 partner genes were matched with 48 781 and 54 296 ENSTs for the $5^{\prime}.$ and $3^{\prime}$ -genes, respectively. Total 60 466 ENSTs were mapped to 15 555 genes involved in 43 895 FGs.  

# Retention analysis of 39 protein features from UniProt  

We first downloaded the protein information in general feature format (GFF) of 15,025 accessions of UniProt for a total of 17 110 genes involved in 43 895 FGs (8). UniProt provides the locus information of 39 protein features, including six molecule processing features, 13 region features, four site features, six amino acid modification features, two natural variation features, five experimental info features, and three secondary structure features. Since such feature locus information are based on amino acid sequence, the genomic sequence of breakpoints was converted to the amino acid information for each kinase, for all protein accessions of UniProt, ENST isoforms and multiple breakpoints of each partner. To map each feature to the human genome sequence, we used the GENCODE gene model of the human reference genome (hg19v19) available from the Encyclopedia of genes and gene variants (GENCODE) (15). For the $5^{\prime}$ -partner genes, if the breakpoints occur after the $3^{\prime}$ end of the protein features, then the protein features are considered to be successfully retained in the fusion genes. On the contrary, if the kinase domain is not completely contained in the resultant FG, such fusion gene is thought to not retain its protein feature. Similarly, for $3^{\prime}.$ -partner gene, we considered the fusion genes to have retained protein features if the breakpoints appear on the $5^{\prime}$ -end of the protein feature region. Table 1 shows the overall statistics of protein feature retention status for individual of ${5}^{\prime}{.}$ - and $3^{\prime}$ -partner genes of FGs.

# Creating fusion transcript and fusion amino acid sequences  

Two different genes can form different FGs with multiple breakpoints based on multiple gene isoforms. Therefore, we considered all gene isoforms at each breakpoint. This study is designed to help users identify and validate FGs. Thus, we focused on the in-frame FGs. To obtain reliable FGs, we checked the distance between the two breakpoints in the case of intra-chromosomal rearrangements and created fusion sequences when these genes are apart more than $100\ \mathrm{kb}$ . We also selected FGs with both of their breakpoints aligned at the exon junction. To call each exon sequence of a given breakpoint, transcription start/end sites, and CDS start/end sites, we used the nibFrag utility of  

UCSC Genome Browser based on ENCODE hg19 genome structure (14). After filtering, we have created 20 935, 20 944, and $45~634$ fusion sequences corresponding to 8714, 8714 and 8788 in-frame FGs for amino acids, CDS transcripts and full-length transcripts, respectively. CDS transcript and amino acid fusion sequences were generated from 54 619 combinations of Ensembl transcripts between 13 491 and 13 207 ENSTs for the $5^{\prime}$ - and $3^{\prime}$ -genes, respectively.  

# Protein-protein interaction information  

We downloaded the interactor information from BIOGRID (v 3.4.260) to provide PPI information for the wildtype proteins of individual fusion partners (16). There are limitations of this dataset, such as providing only the names of the interactors. Since we need to know the locus information for each PPI to search the retention of the PPI at the fusion protein level, we recognized that the ‘Region’ feature is one of the 39 protein features provided by UniProt, which includes the start and end locus information on the structure of each wild-type protein for each PPI. Therefore, we followed the same approach for the protein feature retention screening here. During the protein feature retention search, we also checked whether the fusion proteins retain these interaction loci.  

# Functional or gene category assignment  

To assign the functional or gene categories, we integrated cancer genes in our study, such as oncogenes, tumor suppressors, epigenetic regulators, DNA damage repair genes, kinases, and transcription factors. The first four types of genes were downloaded from CancerGenes, a gene selection resource for cancer genome projects (17); TSGene, an updated literature-based knowledgebase for tumor suppressor genes (18); EpiFactors, a comprehensive database of human epigenetic factors and complexes (17,19); and the data from the studies by Knijnenburg et al. (20). For the gene groups of kinases and transcription factors, we examined the genes with kinase domains or DNA-binding domains and protein features.  

# Drug and disease information  

The drug-target interactions (DTIs) were extracted from the DrugBank (April 2018, version 5.1.0). The duplicated DTI pairs were excluded (12). All drugs were grouped using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system codes. Disease-gene information was extracted from DisGeNet (June 2018, version 4.0) (13), a database of genedisease associations.  

# Database architecture  

The FusionGDB system is based on a three-tier architecture: client, server and database. It includes a user-friendly web interface, Perl’s DBI module, and MySQL database. This database was developed on the MySQL 3.23 with the MyISAM storage engine.  

# WEB INTERFACE AND ANALYSIS RESULTS  

# Fusion gene information category (FusionGeneSummary)  

This category presents detailed information for both of partner genes and fusion genes (Figure 3). For each partner gene, it shows the basic gene information with the Ensembl transcript accessions, including the breakpoints of fusion genes in their gene structures. This category also provides the gene impact assessment scores in pan-cancer fusion genes, including the Degree of Frequency (DoF) score and Major Active Isofusion Index (MAII) score from previous studies (9,10). It is hypothesized if a gene is involved in a fusion gene in multiple cancer types with multiple breakpoints and multiple partner genes, this gene will play a critical role in tumorigenesis. Based on this hypothesis, we defined the DoF score by multiplying three factors. Through dividing the number of fusion positive samples by the number of all possible combination of gene fusion (DoF score), we defined the impact of each isofusion (Supplementary Table S5). Here, isofusion refers to a specific gene fusion combination with one specific partner gene and one specific breakpoint in a particular cancer type (MAII score). When the MAII score is greater than zero and DoF score exceeds 8, we refer to this gene as an ‘effective gene in pan-cancer FGs (eGinPCFGs)’. For a gene with a MAII score less than zero and more than 8 DoF score, we refer to it as a ‘possible effective Gene in Pan-Cancer FGs (peGinPCFGs)’., The user can also obtain the overall function of the fusion gene from this category based on the functional or gene categories assigned from the annotation of protein feature retention and overlapping with particular gene groups. The tables of this category list the Gene Ontology of each partner gene with evidence of Inferred from Direct Assay (IDA), the original fusion gene breakpoint information, and open reading frame (ORF) annotation results for each isofusion (21).  

# Fusion protein feature information category (FusionProtFeature)  

In this category, we provide the detailed annotation of fusion protein function through the retention search of 39 protein features of UniProt based on the broken protein sequence in fusion protein. The first table shows the description of function of each partner, which is adopted from UniProt’s explanation. The following tables show the information of protein feature retention status due to the breakage in the middle of coding region in fusion protein. To achieve this, we downloaded the gff format file of the sequence annotation (features) describing regions or sites of interest in the protein sequence, such as post-translational modifications, binding sites, enzyme active sites, local secondary structure or other characteristics from UniProt. For each fusion breakpoint with multiple gene isoform structures, we screened and investigated whether the protein features of each fusion gene are retained or not. Due to the limited space of the webpage, we only shows 13 regional features in the Table 1, such as ‘calcium binding’, ‘coiled coil’, ‘compositional bias’, ‘DNA binding’, ‘domain’, ‘intramembrane’, ‘motif’, ‘nucleotide binding’, ‘region’, ‘repeat’, ‘topological domain’, ‘transmembrane’,] and ‘zinc finger’. All of the retention information for 39 features are available from the download page.

Figure 3. FusionGeneSummary category. This category shows the overall function of fusion gene and each partner gene. It also provides information of the impact of each gene in pan-cancer fusion genes and functional category assigned by multiple functional annotations.  

ALK fusions are good examples of kinase domain retention in the fusion proteins. ALK is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor. Wild-type ALK undergoes dimerization and subsequent autophosphorylation of the intracellular kinase domain upon ligand binding to its extracellular domain (22). Up to date, ALK has been found to be rearranged, mutated, or amplified in a series of tumors, including anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL), neuroblastoma, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Chromosomal rearrangements are the most common alterations in ALK and result in genetic fusions, such as EML4- ALK, TFG-ALK, NPM1-ALK,] and SQSTM1-ALK (23). Dimerization of fusion proteins leads to the constitutive activation of the kinase and transforming activity (24). Table 2 shows the retention search results for the ALK fusion protein features provided in FusionProtFeature category. In all of these fusion genes, the ‘Protein kinase’ domain of ALK was retained, but the ‘Extracellular’ topological domain was lost. This explains the mechanism of constitutive activation of ALK kinase domain in fusion proteins. Through the systematic annotations of the functional characteristics of a protein in fusion proteins, the user can easily understand the possible roles of fusion genes in relation to their specific tumorigenesis.  

# Fusion transcript and amino acid sequence category (FusionGeneSequence)  

This category provides the fusion sequences for transcripts and amino acids. The DNA level sequences are not included in this category since our fusion breakpoints are exon junction sites or inside of exons identified from the Sanger transcript sequences or RNA-seq reads. After filtering steps (see

Methods), we have created 20 935, 20 944 and 45 634 fusion sequences corresponding to 8714, 8714 and 8788 in-frame FGs for amino acids, CDS transcripts, and full-length transcripts, respectively. Taking the in-frame TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene as example, this category provides 18 full-length fusion transcript sequences, 18 fusion transcript sequences of CDS and 18 fusion amino acid sequences based on three TMPRSS2 isoforms with four breakpoints and three ERG isoforms with two breakpoints. In contrast, when we searched the fusion transcripts and amino acid sequences of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), we were only able to obtain eight fusion transcript sequences and one fusion amino acid sequence (25). Therefore, FusionGeneSequence category in FusionGDB can be used as an important reference or resource for the cancer and drug research communities.  

# Fusion protein-protein interaction information category (FusionGenePPI)  

Protein–protein interaction (PPI) plays a crucial role in the cellular biological processes (26). Specifically, studies have shown that the loss of PPI in the fusion genes leads to abnormal regulation of downstream genes. The well-known case is lysine methyltransferase 2A (MLL) fusion proteins. MLL translocations are associated with a wide array of hematologic malignancy and mutations in several family members are associated with cancer and developmental disorders (27). Due to the truncation of the region of PPIs in the C-terminal MLL protein, MLL fusion proteins fail to retain the PHD finger region, the HCF1 interaction region and the SET domain region. As a result, MLL fusion proteins lose their ability to catalyze H3K4 methylation (28). MLL1 and MLL2 function as large macromolecular complexes composed of ${>}30$ subunits, including several core components. One of the components, WD repeat domain 5 (WDR5) specifically recognizes histone H3 methylated at lysine (29). Consequently, MLL regulated genes in down-stream showed different expressional regulation (30). Through the FusionGenePPI category, in-silico evidence of these facts can be viewed. Firstly, this category shows the interactors at the wild type proteins for both of $5^{\prime}$ - and $3^{\prime}$ partners as shown in Table 3A. The Table 3B and C provides the information of retained or lost PPIs in fusion proteins, respectively. As shown in Table 3C, MLL fusion proteins lose their interactions with histone H3K4me3 and WDR5, consistent with the previous studies. Therefore, our systematic investigation of PPI retention in fusion proteins will be very useful for understanding the genetic and epigenetic effect of fusion proteins in cancer.  

# Pharmacological information and disease information categories (FusionGeneDrug and FusionGeneDisease)  

FusionGeneDrug category provides the pharmacological information associated with the genes involved in FGs from DrugBank (12). Overall, FusionGDB includes 1397 drugs targeting 1314 proteins involved in 8478 FGs. Interestingly, 1341 $(95.99\%)$ are FDA approved drugs targeting 1302 genes. 1619 out of 8478 FGs were overlapped with 8714 in-frame FGs that have fusion amino acid sequences. Among the 1302 genes with FDA approved targeting drugs, 529, 472, 138, 128, 85 and 69 were overlapped with IUPHAR drug target genes, essential genes, oncogenes, tumor suppressors, kinases, and transcription factors (31–33), respectively. According to the generic name stems from Drug Information Portal of National Library of Medicine, among 1312 drugs, there were 19 tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with a stem of ‘-tinib’ at the end of their generic names: Afatinib, Axitinib, Bosutinib, Cabozantinib, Ceritinib, Crizotinib, Dasatinib, Erlotinib, Gefitinib, Ibrutinib, Imatinib, Lapatinib, Lenvatinib, Nilotinib, Ponatinib, Ruxolitinib, Sunitinib, Tofacitinib and Trametinib. These TKIs targeted 51 protein kinases involved in 303 different kinase fusion genes. Furthermore, there were 37 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with a suffix ‘-mab’ at the end of their generic names. Monoclonal antibodies-based therapy for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma has demonstrated high response rates and a favorable toxicity profile in clinical trials (34). Here, 197 FGs are involved in the 37 mAbs-targeted 37 different genes.  

FusionGeneDisease category shows the related disease information for each gene generated from DisGeNet (13). 6169 out of $15~555$ genes involved in $43~895~\mathrm{FGs}$ were reported to be associated with 4679 different types of diseases reported previously. Overall, 2164 $(35.08\%)$ out $6169~\mathrm{FGs}$ are overlapped with the cancer genes from the Catalogue of Cancer Genes.  

# DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTION  

FusionGDB is the first database that systematically annotates the function of fusion genes across pan-cancer. To serve broad biomedical research communities, we will continuously update and curate FGs routinely by checking new fusion gene or fusion protein data. We have identified 331, 303, 840 and 667 in-frame FGs with retaining kinase domains, DNA-binding domains, oncogene domains, and epifactor domains, respectively, and 976 FGs with no retained PPIs. Their genomic relationships, interactions, association with other oncogenes, and downstream effects are important for studying their potential roles in tumorigenesis, as well as developing possible molecular targets. We will extend our current approaches to further investigate the clinically important FGs and address their acting mechanisms as described above in near future. The easy-to-use website provides multiple annotation results to researchers and facilitates comprehensive functional studies of FGs. Thus, FusionGDB will be a useful resource for many investigators in pathology, cancer genomics and precision medicine, drug and therapeutic research, among others.

# Introduction  

The domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris  is among the most phenotypically and medically observed land mammals on earth 1 . Dogs have undergone convergent evolution with humans (2–5 , sharing environmental pressures, food resources and health determinants (6 . Not surprisingly, dogs and humans share many inherited and sporadic diseases including heart disease, neurologic disorders, vision disturbances, metabolic diseases, diabetes, and cancer 7 8 . Dogs are unique among land mammals in their extreme phenotypic diversity (9 , showcasing an extraordinary range of sizes, shapes, and temperaments. Key factors in making this happen is a topic of ongoing and extensive study, but it is clear that both natural selection and human-directed breeding practices, spanning thousands of years, have played key roles (10 11 . The short time frame in which dogs were domesticated (20000— 30000 years) (9 12 , amplifies key issues in species development, making the dog a fascinating topic for studies of evolution, a valued model for identification of disease alleles, a singular system in which to study behavioral genetics, and a unique system for studies of aging (13–15 .  

The Dog10K consortium, initiated in 2019, is an international collaboration building genome and other omics resources to address fundamental questions related to breed dogs, wild canids, village dogs, and niche populations, to better understand he genetic diversity among dogs, race he evolutionary history of domestic dogs, and uncover genetic factors associated with diseases and traits in dogs (8 16 . With a goal of sequencing and analyzing 10000 canid genomes, the recently released Dog10K.v1 provides comprehensive genome sequence data and analysis on 2000 canids (17 . When combined with information on dog phenotype, behavior, and disease, the dataset facilitates research related to the genetic underpinnings of domestication, evolutionary history, breed formation and trait selection, disease susceptibility, aging and population structure (8 16 . This public and now widely-used dataset will benefit the scientific community by answering fundamental questions in mammalian health, development, and biology, with implications for both human and veterinary medicine.  

Herein, we have established the Dog10K database (https: //dog10k.kiz.ac.cn  to facilitate utilization of the massive amount of data generated by the consortium. The inclusion of nearly 2000 canid genomes makes the $\mathrm{Dog10K}$ reference panel the largest in existence to date (17 . n addition to integrating hese data nto he database, we have also ncluded he results from a study of de-novo mutations (DNMs) reflecting 404 trios from 643 dogs (18 , two studies involving 105057 single nuclei and 74067 single cell RNA-seq data rom 18 dogs (3 19 , and a study including 30 bulk RNA-seq data from dogs sampled at different ages (13 . The Dog10K database has provided statistic, browse, search and download modules. Extensive visualization permits direct exploration across multiple fields. We have ncorporated inks n he search results or genes across different parts of data, enabling the integration of results from multi-omics. In addition, we have integrated three analysis tools into the database: Selscan, LiftOver and AgeConversion, to provide both ready access and ease of use.  

# Materials and methods  

# Data collection and pre-process  

The SNVs and individual information included herein derive from the Dog10K consortium (17  and a recent study of recombination rates nvolving 404 rios rom 643 dogs 18 . The filtered $\mathrm{Dog10K}$ dataset includes 1987 individual canids from 321 dog breeds, village dogs from 26 different countries, and wolves from across Eurasia. n total, 34.6 million SNVs were identified (Table 1 . The VCF file was annotated using VEP (20 . The VEP cache was downloaded from Ensembl (21 . We downloaded he DNMs data rom what s currently he argest DNM study in domestic dogs, which includes 643 dogs from 54 multi-generational families representing 43 distinct breeds (18  Table 1 . Single-cell RNA sequencing data were recruited from two different studies (3 19 : the first includes an expression matrix of 105057 single nuclei with a median of 804 genes and 1109 counts per nucleus using eight cell types (3 ; the second contained single cell data rom 10 dogs with cancer and samples from 7 healthy dogs for a final dataset of 74067 cells (Table 1 . Forty-six unique clusters were identified, with major immune cell types predominating (19 . We extracted the gene expression matrix, cell clustering and cell type information from the downloaded files using Scanpy (22  and Seurat (23 . We performed differential expression gene screening for each cell type between healthy and osteosarcoma dogs using the FindMarkers function in Seurat (p_val_adj $<0.05$ , | avg_log2FC $\mid\geq1.5$ , Wilcoxon rank-sum test).

Dog whole blood expression data were downloaded from Zeng et al. (13 , and included samples from 30 dogs aged 1 to 9 at the time of blood draw. Human whole blood expression data were downloaded from ARCHS4 (24 , and included information from 469 humans aged 8 to 75 years at the time of collection (GSE94438, GSE112087, GSE123658 and GSE134080) (25–29  (Table 1 . Expression levels were calculated as counts per million (CPM) using EdgeR (30  and log-transformed. In order to align the gene expression levels between different species we downloaded the homologous gene list from humans, dogs and mice using the OMA Orthology (31 . We obtained 13783 one to one ortholog genes with expression data, thus generating a complete dataset for studies of aging. LOESS (32  interpolation was performed to obtain smoothed expression value and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to identify genes with similar agerelated expression patterns between humans and dogs. Genes with correlation values greater than 0.8 were defined as ones with similar age-related expression patterns between humans and dogs.  

# Tools integration and deployment  

To build a robust workflow for data analysis tools the backend of the $\mathrm{Dog10k}$ database online tools server uses a modular design architecture. These include object-oriented methods and container classes to ensure input/output streams and parameter settings between different data processing units. LiftOver, Selscan and Age conversions are deployed on a Linux computing server using Docker and open APIs. The $\mathrm{Dog10K}$ database calls the interface, receives the result data for processing, and displays the data on the database frontend page. The LiftOver software was downloaded rom UCSC (https://genome.ucsc.edu/ , his web interface was designed to take input index chain files from the UCSC database and bed files for positional information conversion. The prototype of the selscan online analysis tool is derived from selscan $\mathrm{v}2.0$ (33 . The selscan back-end code integrates bcftools v1.20 (34) for splitting he arget sample vcf file and vcftools v0.1.16 35 in order to convert vcf files to PLINK mapping files in the Dog10K dataset. Plink files were converted to map files using the ormula $1{\mathrm{cM}}/{\mathrm{Mb}}$ or all chromsomes. The age calculation module back-end integrates the formulas for age conversions between dogs and humans as follows(14 15 :  

1) human $\mathrm{age}=16\mathrm{ln}\ (\mathrm{dog\age})+31$ ;   
2) human $\begin{array}{r}{\mathsf{a g e}{=}\frac{(d o g a g e+1.5)\times(b+1.5)}{(d+1.5)}{-1.5}}\end{array}$ , where $\mathrm{~h~}=\ 13.5$ $\mathrm{d}=1.83287671232877$  

# Database design and visualization  

The $\mathrm{Dog10K}$ database was deployed n a virtual machine running Windows Server 2016 using Internet Information Services (IIS) for service. The Dog10K database backend was implemented using C# language and NET MVC framework, while the web frontend for server-side scripting was organised using HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript. LayUI framework (https:// layui.dev/) and JQuery https://jquery.com/) or nteractive nterface building. All data was stored in Microsoft SQL Server. Given the massive amount of data, over 200 million records, Apache Solr facilitated lightning-fast searching. MinIO, a S3- compatible object storage system, provided he corresponding file for downloads (Figure 1 .  

The Dog10K database exhibits different charts on data distribution and annotation statistics on the web interface. The interactive visualization of the analysis results was implemented using Apache ECharts (https://echarts.apache. org/ , and Jbrowse2 (https:// browse.org/ b2/  for the genome browser with views of synteny and structural variation, plotly python graphing library (https://plotly.com/python/  for statistical histograms and single cell UMAP. The Familytree.js plugin (https://balkan.app/FamilyTreeJS  was used for building he amily ree. Familytree.js s a JavaScript ibrary hat enables the creation and visualisation of family trees directly in web browsers. t provides a simple and ntuitive API or defining family relationships, adding individuals, and customising the appearance of the tree. Cxplot is a JavaScript wrapper for CanvasXpress (https://www.cxplot.com/  for constructing the aging transcriptome graph. The genomes and annotations used in genome browser were downloaded from NCBI (Figure 1 .  

Dog10K database supports most of the widely used web browsers including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft edge. The research community can access information freely in the Dog10K database without registration or log in.  

# Results  

# Overview of Dog10K database  

The Dog10K database consists of four parts as shwon in Figure 1  (i) the single nucleotide variant (SNV) information from the Dog10K consortium (17 ; (ii) the de-novo mutation (DNM) nformation summarizing he argest currently known DNM studies n dogs 18 ; iii) scRNA, he single nucleus and single cell transcriptomes from two published papers (3 19 ; and (iv) whole blood expression data from dogs and humans of different ages from several published studies (25–28  (Materials and methods). We provide basic information, anlaysis and summary statistics for each section on the home page. Users can search and filter based on multiple tems. The results are presented using interactive visualizations such as UMAP, family trees, Genome Browser, and expression profiles. We also provide the option to download the data. The Dog10K database also includes three analysis tools: (i) Selscan, which performs haplotype-based scans o detect natural selection; ii) LiftOver, which converts genome coordinates between different version of genomes; (iii) AgeConversion, which converts ages between dog and human.  

# Web content and usage  

The Home page features an introduction to the Dog10K database, basic statistics and a data summary. The search box on the home page allows users to perform quick searches for single nucleotide variant sites, de-novo mutation information, genes expression of scRNA, gene expression of different ages, and genes in genome browser.  

# SNVs  

The posted Dog10K SNVs (17  have been integrated into a visualized table (Figure 2B). Users can input the chromosome number (eg., chr2), and start and end site in the inquiry box (e.g. 15888–15906) to search for variants at the corresponding site. Users can also input a gene symbol name or an ensembl D o query SNV nformation at he site contained n he genic region. The table displays information regarding SNVs, including chromosome number, position, reference base, alternative base, gene ID, gene symbol, variant type, etc. Each row represents a SNV site. Clicking on ‘SAMPLES’ in the last column of each row will open a new web interface showing variation and sample information for each individual at that site. n his new web nterface the user can filter or the breeds and sex. By clicking on ‘SNV Browser’ or ‘Gene Browser’ in the last column, users can jump to the Genome Browser web page for that site or gene.  

The Genome Browser section provides visualization of four releases of the canine genome (Dog10K_Boxer_Tasha/canFam6 (36 , UMICH_Zoey_3.1/canFam5, UU_Cfam_GSD_1.0/canFam4 (37  and Broad CanFam3.1/canFam3) together with annotation (Figure 2H). n the Broad_CanFam_3.1 release, users can browse the VCF file for DNMs (643_Pedigrees.SNPs.vcf). In the UU_Cfam_GSD_1.0 release, users can browse the VCF file for Dog10K (Dog10K.SNPs.vcf). Users can also zoom in to see the base sequence of the genome. By clicking on a site in the VCF box users can view detailed information about that site. Users can also search for chromosomes (e.g. chr1, 1, NC_006583.4), locations (e.g. 1:5361..7304), gene symbols (e.g. TOX , etc. in the search box to browse desired information.

Figure 1. Overview of he Dog10K database: The data ncluded n he Dog10K database were downloaded rom many canine esearch projects and comprise our main parts: SNVs, DNMs, scRNA and aging ranscriptome. We have performed statistical analysis and visualisation on hese datasets, which nteract across he our parts. The Dog10K database supports searching and filtering of esults based on different tems and allows data downloads. n addition, we ntegrates hree analysis ools: LiftOver, Selscan and AgeConversion. The construction of our database s mainly n hree aspects: Database and file, backen, rontend and visualization. We use multiple ools o achieve his Methods).  

# DNMs  

In the web interface for DNMs (Figure 2C), the number of DNMs associated with each breed is shown by histogram, with he different colors representing distinct pedigrees. Below the histograms s an nteractive and digitized able hat allows users to quickly search and browse DNMs information. The table includes dog id, breed, gender, position, reference base, alternative base, gene D, gene symbol, variant ype, amily D, etc. Various search tems are provided within he DNMs module. Users can search for DNMs information by dog pedigree number, dog D, dog breed, variant ype, chromosome, or gene symbol. To view pedigrees we constructed family trees for all 54 families, and users can navigate to the corresponding family tree webpage by clicking on ‘Family Tree’. The family tree webpage includes the breed photo (downloaded from AKC: American Kennel Club) and family tree of an individual family, making the DNMs section user friendly. The text in each box shows the individual’s sample name, number of DNMs, and sex. Users can also export the family trees to various file types.  

scRNA and expression data associated with aging analysis We reproduced the previously published results (3 19  of cell clustering UMAP on the webpage, with different colors representing different cell types (Figure 2D). Users can search for genes of nterest n order o view associated expression profiles for various cell ypes. When he cursor s placed on he UMAP picture, users can view the full name of the cell type and the gene markers (the left UMAP) or gene expression levels (the right UMAP). By clicking he dropdown menu or Hippocampus’ and ‘Leukocytes’ users can switch between the results of two previous publications (3 19 . The first paper by Zhou et al. 3 , ncludes a single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas of one dog hippocampus using SPLiT-seq. The second paper by Ammons et al. (19  conducted single-cell transcriptomic analysis on seven middle-aged healthy dogs of various breeds and genders to establish a reference database for canine leukocytes, and then used this database to study changes in leukocyte abundances and transcriptomes in ten dogs with spontaneous osteosarcoma. By clicking the dropdown menu for ‘DEGs’, users can view the list of differentially expressed genes and related information between healthy and osteosarcoma dog for each cell type. Zeng et al. (13  sequenced RNA-seq data from 30 dogs aged 1 to 9 years to study changes in gene expression with aging. We also downloaded the transcriptome data from human of different ages for comparison (Methods). Scatter plots of the normalized gene counts for each gene in human and dog samples of different ages were created the fitting curve smoothed (Materials and methods). Users can search for specific genes and view expression changes associated with aging, and compare the data between dogs and humans. When the cursor is placed on the scatter plots, users can view the ID, age and expression value of a given individual. We compared gene expression data between humans and dogs o dentify genes with similar age-related expression patterns. We found 718 similar genes with Pearson correlation coefficients $>0.8$ . By selecting ‘Similar genes’ from the Aging Transcriptome drop-down menu, users can view a list of these similar genes and related information.

# Effective online analysis tools  

The analysis module provides online analysis of three tools: Liftover, Selscan and AgeConversion. Liftover (38 is an analysis tool in UCSC that supports the conversion of multiple genome versions, we integrated it into our database for the conversion between the human $\left(\mathrm{GRCh}38/\mathrm{hg}38\right)$ , dog (Dog10K_Boxer_Tasha/canFam6 (36 , UMICH_Zoey_3.1/canFam5, UU_Cfam_GSD_1.0/canFam4 (37 , Broad CanFam3.1/canFam3) and mouse $(\mathrm{GRCm}39/\mathrm{mm}39\$ , $\mathrm{GRCm}38/\mathrm{mm}10\rangle$ ) genomes (Figure 2G). Users can choose the original genome (before conversion) and the new genome (after conversion), then enter the text or a file in BED format for positional information conversion. The results will be displayed on a new web page, with tables of successfully converted records and failed conversion records, all of which are available for download. Users can also view the messages about failed conversion by clicking ‘Explain failure messages’.  

Selscan (33  is an efficient tool for haplotype-based scans and permits detection of natural selection, which is key to identifying recent or ongoing positive selection in genomes. We integrated it into our database, allowing users to perform selection analysis on the datasets generated by the Dog10K consortium.Users can select the analysis method they wish to use in the ‘Method’ section (XP-nsl, XP-EHH, iHS, iHH12 and nSL) (Figure 2G), and chose the samples to be analyzed in he Group’ box below. Users can nput a keyword search o filter samples within a particular category. This exercise s case sensitive. Finally, once users ype heir own e-mail address and submit their query the analysis will run on a computer cluster (32 cores, 16GB RAM, located at the Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences). Due to the long running time (several hours to several days depending on the population size), he final results will be sent o users by e-mail. Click the link in the email to navigate to a $\mathrm{Dog10K}$ database interface showing he first 100 ines of he results file. By clicking ‘View results’ and ‘View log’ on this web interface, users can download the results file and log file.  

![](images/3eb96503624e96fb3359bd892894ab9442d3af615c1cf277171f1dcb4bc49178.jpg)

We use XP-nSL method as an example to demonstrate how to use the Selscan module (Figure 2G, I). In the Group 1 box, select the test population, such as by entering ‘Boxer’ in the search box, o find all boxer breed individuals, and check ‘All’ to select all the boxer individuals. In the Group 2 box, select the reference population, such as ‘Labrador Retriever’ to find all Labrador retriever dogs, and check ‘All’ to select all the labrador individuals. After that, click the green arrow button between all samples box and selected samples box to move the selected boxer individuals and labrador individuals to the selected box on the right. It indicates that these individuals will be used for analysis. Finally, users should input their email address and click submit. A confirmation webpage will appear, displaying he selected method, samples, and email address. After confirming, the analysis will be run on the computer cluster and the results will be returned in about $12\mathrm{h}$ via email. Click the ‘view result’ link in the e-mail to navigate to a $\mathrm{Dog10K}$ database interface showing the first 100 lines of the results file, containing SNP ID (id), position of the variant on the chromosome (pos), genetic position (gpos), p-value for these two populations (p1, p2), the nSL scores for these two populations (sL1, sL2), and XP-nSL score for each SNP. The XP-nSL score shows the degree of selective pressure between these two populations. By clicking ‘View results’ and ‘View ${\mathrm{log}}^{\prime}$ , users can download the results file and log file of this analysis.  

AgeConversion performs single or batch age conversions between dogs and humans. We summarized the formulas for converting human and dog ages from the published papers (14 15  Materials and methods). Users can select he age conversion formula they wish, then enter the age to be converted in either the ‘Dog age’ or ‘Human age’ box. By clicking on the arrow corresponding to the desired direction, the converted result will display in the other box.  

# Case study showing interactions among multi-omic data  

The Dog10K database allows omics data to switch quickly between different sections by clicking on corresponding links. Considering he TOX gene as an example, he nteractions between different omics sections in the database can be highlighted. First, users can enter ‘TOX  in the search box on the homepage Figure 3A). f he corresponding directory s not selected rom he dropdown menu on he eft, clicking he search button will automatically navigate to the TOX search results in the SNVs section (Figure 3B), displaying a table of variant sites within TOX  Clicking ‘DNMs’ on the right of the SNVs table will redirect to the de-novo mutation information table for his gene Figure 3C). Clicking Family Tree’ on he right of the DNMs able will display he pedigree or his amily and a picture of he breed Figure 3D). Clicking scRNA’ on he right of the DNMs table will redirect to the single-cell data showing the expression profile of this gene in different cell types (Figure 3E). Clicking ‘Aging transcriptome’ will redirect the user to the expression profile of the gene in dogs of different ages (Figure 3F). Similarly, clicking ‘Gene Browse’ or ‘SNV Browser’ will navigate to the Genome Browser interface for this gene or this SNV site. Thus, the search results for each section are linked to other sections. The interaction of different omics allows the user to view results across multiple types of data intuitively and easily.  

Different studies may use different versions of genomes with different gene IDs. We optimized our gene list to align gene IDs and gene names across different genome versions and provide users with a search suggestion for the corresponding gene name when a gene ID from one version is not found. For instance, the gene ID for TOX in the UU_Cfam_GSD_1.0 genome version (used in SNVs study) is ENSCAFG00805029461, whereas it is ENSCAFG00000007137 in the Broad_CanFam_3.1 genome version (used in DNMs study). When users search for ENSCAFG00805029461 on the DNMs webpage, a suggestion will appear below the search box: ‘The gene ID is matching TOX, please try to search by TOX.’ Users will find the corresponding gene search results by clicking on TOX or searching for TOX again.  

# Discussion and future development  

The Dog10K database provides a platform for convenient browse and utilize the massive data produced by the $\mathrm{Dog10K}$ Consortium. Multi-omics joint analyses are critical to scientific advancement and this database includes information regarding de-novo mutations, single-cell RNA sequence, and bulk transcriptome data from dogs of different ages. These data help address questions regarding the mapping of canine diseases genes and studies of aging. The database is userfriendly and data are easily visualized, helping researchers from different fields to intuitively view results. For instance, the family tree in the DNMs section will assist users in understanding the given dog’s pedigree structure and will provide an opportunity to see the the relationship between the DNMs and pedigree.  

Due to the existence of several dog reference genomes, we have integrated the UCSC LiftOver tool to perform conversions between different versions of the dog genome, as well as between the dog, human and mouse genomes. To better utilize the Dog10K data, we have integrated Selscan, a tool for haplotype-based scans o detect natural selection. This module allows or selection analysis on he specified arget population from individuals in the Dog10K dataset. The AgeConversion tool summarizes the formulas for converting human and dog ages making it a useful tool for researchers, veterinarians and dog owners. These tools enhance the usability of the data in our database and contribute to canine-related research. Additional tools will be added in the future for users who are not familiar with bioinformatics or who want to quickly obtain analysis results online.  

The Dog10K consortium promotes he dog as a premier genetic system for revealing fundamental mechanisms into evolution, health and biology. It has generated a comprehensive data set resulting in a resource that is proving invaluable to a wide range of fields, such as comparative genomics, evolutionary biology, medical research etc. n he uture, he consortium will capture genomic variation among non-breed dogs from geographical regions around the world, as well as their wild relatives. This will enhance studies of evolutionary relationships. Ongoing efforts to build more high-quality reference genomes and related study results will be included in future versions of this database.  

With he advent of he single-cell ranscriptomics and multiomics era, an increasing amount of multi-omics data being generated on dogs. Using DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles and chromatin accessibility to build ‘epigenetic clocks’ is a promising direction to integrate with aging transcriptome (14 15 39 . The Dog10K database will be updated regularly with new data as it becomes available.

# ABSTRACT  

The dbPSHP database (http://jjwanglab.org/dbpshp) aims to help researchers to efficiently identify, validate and visualize putative positively selected loci in human evolution and further discover the mechanism governing these natural selections. Recent evolution of human populations at the genomic level reflects the adaptations to the living environments, including climate change and availability and stability of nutrients. Many genetic regions under positive selection have been identified, which assist us to understand how natural selection has shaped population differences. Here, we manually collect recent positive selections in different human populations, consisting of 15 472 loci from 132 publications. We further compiled a database that used 15 statistical terms of different evolutionary attributes for single nucleotide variant sites from the HapMap 3 and 1000 Genomes Project to identify putative regions under positive selection. These attributes include variant allele/genotype properties, variant heterozygosity, within population diversity, longrange haplotypes, pairwise population differentiation and evolutionary conservation. We also provide interactive pages for visualization and annotation of different selective signals. The database is freely available to the public and will be frequently updated.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Natural selection plays a crucial role in the evolution of species, where random mutations are undergoing positive, purifying or balancing selection (1) for adaptation to the living environments including climate change, availability and stability of nutrients, introduction of novel disease agents, dispersed niche, etc. Recent evolutionary adaptations in the human lineage have been reflected by many population-specific traits such as pigmentation, malaria resistance and lactose tolerance (2–4). Many genetic regions of human genome under positive selection have been successfully identified, which assist us in understanding how natural selection has shaped population differences (5). Signatures of selection can be detected by observing the underlying patterns of DNA polymorphisms in one or different populations, which will facilitate the identification of positively selected genes or loci that are associated with specific function, trait or disease (6,7). Statistical methods and tools have been successfully developed to detect genome-wide selective signals based on genetic data of human populations. Given one population, positive or negative selection tends to skew the allele frequencies comparing with neutral model. Statistics such as Tajima’s D (8) and Fay and Wu’s H (9) can detect a locus’s departures from neutrality and underlying selection. Linkage information can also be used to infer the selection signals. Besides, strong selection signal can also be discovered by searching a long-range haplotype. Extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) (10) and integrated haplotype score (iHS) (11) have been used to capture these loci based on the length of haplotypes associated with a given allele. Recently, several new programs, such as HaploPS and SweeD, have been developed to efficiently search the regions on the genome carrying positive selection signals with higher sensitivity and specificity (12,13). Positive selection can also be identified by tracking the increment of identity-bydescent among individuals in a population (14,15).  

Moreover, large allele frequency differences between populations can be measured by fixation index $(F_{\mathrm{ST}})$ (16) at each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) locus in the genome. Researchers also developed a tool, cross-population extended haplotype homozygosity test (XP-EHH), to detect ongoing or nearly fixed selective sweeps by comparing haplotypes from two populations (17). The cross-population composite likelihood ratio test (XP-CLR) scans multi-locus allele frequency differentiation between two populations to detect selective sweeps in analogy to EHH (18). Last, rejected substitution is adopted in genomic evolutionary rate profiling (19) to assess the strength of the selected elements on single nucleotide level.  

The causal mutations for population adaptation have been proved to locate in many functional loci on the human genome. For different human populations, studies have shown that environmental changes, such as diet, climate and infectious disease, have caused advantageous rapid amino acid evolutions and consequently affect protein functions (20). Analysis has also been performed to identify a number of positively selected synonymous variants affecting the translation efficiency (21). Recently, researchers revealed that local adaptations have a higher chance to affect gene expression than amino acid sequence by studying selective signals between gene expression-associated SNPs and nonsynonymous SNPs (22). Until now, over hundreds of functionassociated regions/genes have been reportedly undergoing positive selection from different human populations by inferring population genetic data. However, it is a tedious and time-consuming process of curation if researchers want to retrieve the selection information of their regions of interest or traits from literature. By far, little resources are available for users to search for known selective regions and their associated function effects.  

However, the selective signals detected by aforementioned statistical methods are not always consistent in terms of the degree of derived allele frequency, which is usually varied by different datasets. To accurately identify true positive selection and the causal mutation, we need to combine different statistical values. A composite of multiple signals method has been proposed to combine five selective signals with satisfactory power (23). Some resources such as SNP $\textcircled{2}$ Ethnos (24), Haplotter (11), SNP $\textcircled{2}$ Evolution (25) and dbCLINE (26) have also provided respective selection signals for some populations in early HapMap dataset. However, more supporting signals are needed for explicit elaboration, and more world-wide populations should be investigated based on larger sample size. The recent International HapMap Project and 1000 Genomes Project have produced high quality genotyping data in a large sample size of different human populations, which enable us to systematically detect natural selection signals in a genome wide scale (27,28). Therefore, a comprehensive, easy-to-use and upto-date resource focusing on recent human positive selection is urgently required.  

Here we developed a database dbPSHP, a user friendly web portal on recent positive selection across human populations. We first manually collected 15 472 recent positive selections and related information in different human populations from literature. We further compiled a database that contains 15 calculated statistical signals for SNP sites from the HapMap 3 and 1000 Genomes Projects, which focus on variant allele/genotype properties, variant heterozygosity, within population diversity, longrange haplotypes, pairwise population differentiation and evolutionary conservation. We also provided interactive pages for visualization and annotation of different selective signals.  

# DATABASE DESIGN AND CONTENT  

dbPSHP provides a manually curated dataset of positively selected loci of human populations from literature. It also consists of a variety of important attributes associated with recent human selection for one or pairwise populations under a consistent framework. The selection signals are evaluated on several aspects including ancestral and derived allele, allele frequency, genotype frequency, Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), heterozygosity, nucleotide diversity, Tajima’s D, iHH, iHS, derived allele frequency difference (DAF), fixation index $(F_{\mathrm{ST}})$ , XP-EHH, XP-CLR, neutral rate, and rejected substitution (Table 1). Furthermore, dbPSHP has been designed as a knowledge base and web service that offers a rapid search and interactive interface for the users.  

We started with data collection from the publications attempting to study positively selected loci/genes related to specific functions/traits/diseases of human populations during recent human evolution. We manually searched these publications through PubMed and occasional collection of some specific reports by natural selection related keywords (details in Supplementary Methods). The current version of dbPSHP contains 15 472 manually collected loci/genes under positive selection from 132 publications. Among them, 101 publications attempt to study the specific adaptive traits, and 31 publications detect the genome-wide selective signals with different statistical methods.  

We then processed the genetic data of different populations using the International HapMap phase 3 and the 1000 Genomes Project phase 1 (details in Supplementary Methods). We pre-computed statistical scores in different categories that mainly include variant allele/genotype frequency, variant heterozygosity, within population diversity, long-range haplotypes, pairwise population differentiation and evolutionary conservation (Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Methods).  

There are different criteria to determine whether the investigated loci have been undergoing positive selection. High frequency of derived allele, deviations from HWE, reduced heterozygosity, negative Tajima’s D, high $F_{\mathrm{ST}}$ value and relatively higher iHS more or less indicate the selective signals. To facilitate the identification of true signals, we designed a filtering function by a set of defined score cutoff, which have been frequently used as empirical estimation of positive selection in current evolution studies. We further generated a list of putatively causal mutations for each population using these hard filtering (Supplementary Methods).

# EVALUATION  

To evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the statistical scores in dbPSHP, we first used two well-known cases under strong positive selection in specific population. Lactose tolerance has been previously identified as the positive selection in a large fraction of individuals of European descent after domestication of cattle, which genetically caused by a mutation in the lactase gene $(L C T)$ (4). We validated the statistical scores for all of genetic variants in the $L C T$ gene and nearby $500\mathrm{kb}$ genetic hitchhiking region in the CEU population. We found this positively selected region is significantly supported by all critical signals of most genetic variants in both HapMap 3 and 1000 Genomes Project dataset, including highly deviated derived allele frequency (DAF), distinguished iHS and high $F_{\mathrm{ST}}$ , XP-EHH and XP-CLR values compared with other populations (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). Further, we used another well studied gene, SLC24A5, related to the selection of lighter pigmentation between Europeans and West Africans (29). We checked the selective scores along the SLC24A5 and neighbouring selective sweep and we found, for CEU population of both HapMap 3 and 1000 Genomes Project dataset, there are increased signals of derived allele frequency and other indicators, especially in the downstream of SLC24A5 gene (Supplementary Figures S3 and S4).  

Furthermore, we measured the overall reliability of precalculated scores in dbPSHP by comparing the score distribution between reported selective region and background. We collected 997 CEU loci, 574 YRI loci and 516 CHB loci from our curated positive selection list. We then extracted all genetic variants within these regions from both HapMap 3 and 1000 Genomes Project dataset. We constructed background genetic variants by randomly selecting the same number of genomic regions. We performed Mann–Whitney U test, for $F_{\mathrm{ST}}$ , iHS , XPEHH and XP-CLR, to examine whether the selective scores in curated regions (regarded as under positive selection) are significantly larger than those in the background. We finally observed significant differences for almost all cases in different populations and the SNP dataset (Supplementary Table S4). The experiment further confirmed the usability of dbPSHP as a useful resource in the studies of recent human evolution.  

Although there are some resources, such as SNP $@$ Ethnos, Haplotter and SNP $\textcircled{a}$ Evolution, that selectively calculate particular selection scores in some populations using a different version of the HapMap dataset, it can hardly satisfy the immediate requirements of human evolutionary biology and population genetics. Even for the frequently used dataset CMS (23), it only provides five statistical scores (iHS, XP-EHH, iHH, $\Delta\mathrm{DAF}$ and $F_{\mathrm{ST}})$ on limited population, as well as a simple query interface. Comparing with these resources, dbPSHP systematically curates reported function-related regions/genes under recent positive selection in the human populations from literature. It also constructs a database integrating up to 15 statistical terms for positive selection by a large number of populations, latest human genetic dataset and interactive user interfaces, which allows detecting a different level of positive selections and facilitates better hypothesis generation (Supplementary Table S5).  

# USAGE  

dbPSHP website accepts three input formats including dbSNP ID, genomic locus and RefGene name. dbSNP ID will be converted to dbSNP 137 according to the SNP track history RsMergeArch. Genomic locus can be either a site (e.g. chr2:136575199) or a region (e.g. chr5:33944721-33984780). Both gene official symbol and Refseq accession number are supported as queries. For sanity visualization, the system will extend $50\mathrm{kb}$ surrounding regions if a user inputs a signal site. Users can also select the SNP data set (HapMap3 or 1000 Genomes Project) and investigated population in the input page. Also, a user can filter and sort the selection scores under different combination of empirical cutoffs.  

dbPSHP uses a series of user-friendly interfaces to display the results, which not only efficiently present the query result but also facilitate the knowledge findings. The top left panel of the result page consists of three tabs. It first provides a scatter plot drawing the distribution of selective scores in the query region. A user can switch among different attributes by changing the select box. In this function, dbPSHP only returns the loci containing the selected attribute. The chart can be clicked, zoomed and is highly interactive with summary table below (Figure 1a). Besides, dbPSHP uses Google Map KML to generate the allele frequency map for all populations of selected SNP data set on a global Google Map, which provides an intuitive view for the allele distribution worldwide. The current population will be highlighted by a red outline (Figure 1b). A user can click each pie chart to get detailed information about the population in this map. dbPSHP also customizes related tracks in the UCSC Genome Browser, and a user can check it in the last internal tab of this panel.  

Below the abovementioned panel, dbPSHP offers a summary table that extracts some important attributes for selected variants. Each row on the table can be clicked and is interactive with the above scatter plot (Figure 1c). The right panel in the result page has three tabs that show detailed information about a selected variant. The ‘dbPSHP Information’ tab lists the important attributes related to positive selection and reports the information of a published selective region as well as previous GWAS results recorded in GWASdb (30) (Figure 1d). ‘Cross Population’ tab records cross-population scores between queried population and each of the other populations by several statistical measurements including $\Delta\mathrm{DAF}$ , $F_{\mathrm{ST}}$ , XP-EHH and XP-CLR. To facilitate the identification of driver mutation in the investigated genetic hitchhiking region, a particular tab ‘Variant Annotation’ connects current variants to a comprehensive annotation browser SNVrap (31).  

To benefit from efficient storage and simplify querying from the client environment, we encapsulated all selective attributes into a VCF INFO field and created an indexed VCF compressed file for each population using Tabix (32). Users can extract information by vcftools (33) for further process. dbPSHP also hosts a FTP server which contains compressed files and curation data for downloading. Because the full database is relatively large, we further provided RESTful style of Web Services for instant retrieving of interested regions by different interfaces.  

dbPSHP hosts a repository with collected literaturebased loci with positively selected signals as well as their effects (Figure 1e). Users can query the records by text-free description such as ‘rs16891982’, ‘Pigmentation’, ‘LCT’ and ‘chr6:148734174-149732519’. Besides, dbPSHP also accepts the submission of newly discovered positive selections, which will be added into dbPSHP after double checking.  

# DISSCUSSION  

dbPSHP is a database that systematically collects reported function-related regions/genes under recent positive selection in the human population. Our manually curated database will be frequently updated. dbPSHP further compiles a comprehensive resource that uses 15 evolutionary/statistical terms for the world-wide populations from the HapMap 3 and 1000 Genomes Project. Users can conveniently retrieve the information in either website or client by flexible queries. A set of visualization pages provides extensive views for intuitive identification of different selective signals. We believe this resource will help researchers efficiently identify, visualize and validate putative positively selected loci, as well as the causal mutation, in human evolution, and to further discover the mechanism behind these natural selections.  

The statistical scores used in the database have been widely used to efficiently identify the genetic signatures of natural selection and accelerate follow-up downstream functional study. The imprint of evolutionary selection on ENCODE regulatory elements have been substantially studied, and many positive or negative selection regions are found to be functionally relevant (34). As the genomewide association studies (GWAS) and the emerging whole genome sequencing studies (WGS) are discovering a huge number of disease associated genetic variants, future studies will be focused on the functional validation of these genetic variants, where human evolution is an essential part. Systematic evaluation of the selection attributes of associated genetic variants detected by GWAS may facilitate the finding of true causal loci for complex traits of specific population (35). Many traits/diseases associatedSNPs (30) expressed population-specific alleles as a result of different natural selection patterns across the population by polygenic adaptation (36–38). Using the evolutionary spectrum based on SNPs data and comprehensive genomic data, researchers have successfully identified many locally adapted genes or loci under environmental selection (39–41).

(c) The summary table of important statistical terms for selected variant. (d) The three tabs records detailed information about selected variant including variant attributes, selective scores, literature evidence, mapped gene, GWAS information, cross population selective signals and comprehensive variant annotations from the external browser. (e) The searchable table collected literaturebased positive selections in the human population.  

In addition, tracking the natural selection between human and other species can also promote functional implications of positively selected loci. With high-coverage genome data, researchers successfully identified lots of orthologous genes under positive selection across mammalian or primate genomes (42,43). Apart from genes, many other genomic elements have also been revealed under positive evolutional selection according to interspecies investigation, which include transcription factor binding sites (44), enhancers (45), non-coding DNAs (46) and transposable element-derived fragments (47). These results can efficiently benefit the functional interpretation of shared genomic elements driven by similar adaptive forces between species. Also, it will greatly facilitate the finding of genomic loci, which are selected uniquely during recent human evolution.  

It is noticeable that there are many strategies to detect the true selective outliers from the background. For example, the normal range of $F_{\mathrm{ST}}$ lies between 0–1, but negative values may indicate sampling error, which should be excluded in the following procedure. Traditionally, the empirical $F_{\mathrm{ST}}$ $P$ -value can be obtained by fitting to genome wide empirical distributions of $F_{\mathrm{ST}}$ , which are generated from SNPs data. To eliminate the false positive loci from genome scans when using $F_{\mathrm{ST}}$ , a researcher proposed a hierarchical island model comparing with a simple island model (48). Besides, simulated DNA sequence can also be used to generate neutral distributions to test the probability of a $F_{\mathrm{ST}}$ without ascertainment biases (49). Another widely used approach is to identify the candidates of selection regions from iHS. It is suggested that raw iHS need to be binned by defined genetic distance first and the variant with derived allele frequency $<5\%$ should be removed. Then, a sliding window of 50 SNPs is applied to compute the percentage of SNPs with $|\mathrm{i}\mathrm{H}\mathrm{S}|>2$ The same strategy is also usually adopted in the processing of XP-EHH. Therefore, many raw statistical values in our database should be rightly fitted to the desired context when distinguishing true signals from noises. Some factors could also influence the sensitivity and specificity of positive selection detection methods. For example, genetic drift can drive a derived allele to fixation, which should be distinguished from selection. Ratnakumar et al. proposed that genes identified as targets of positive selection had a significant tendency to exhibit the genomic signature of GC-biased gene conversion (50). We also identified that the nucleotide substitutions ratio $(\mathrm{W{\mathrm{-}}{>}S/S{\mathrm{-}}{>}W})$ in recent selection dataset of three populations was significantly elevated than that in all genes (Supplementary Methods). Recently, a study showed that pervasive genetic hitchhiking drives the simultaneous emergence of mutational cohorts in yeast (51), and the loss-of-function mutations can contribute to the adaptation of bacteria by rewiring a regulatory or a metabolic network (52). These findings also pointed out new strategies to track the positive selection signals in human populations.

# ABSTRACT  

AI-driven protein structure prediction, most notably AlphaFold2 (AF2) opens new frontiers for almost all fields of structural biology. As traditional structure prediction methods for transmembrane proteins were both complicated and error prone, AF2 is a great help to the community. Complementing the relatively meager number of experimental structures, AF2 provides 3D predictions for thousands of new alpha-helical membrane proteins. However, the lack of reliable structural templates and the fact that AF2 was not trained to handle phase boundaries also necessitates a delicate assessment of structural correctness. In our new database, Transmembrane AlphaFold database (TmAlphaFold database), we apply TMDET, a simple geometry-based method to visualize the likeliest position of the membrane plane. In addition, we calculate several parameters to evaluate the location of the protein into the membrane. This also allows TmAlphaFold database to show whether the predicted 3D structure is realistic or not. The TmAlphaFold database is available at https://tmalphafold.ttk.hu/.  

# INTRODUCTION  

The folding problem (i.e. correct prediction of the 3D structure of any protein based on their amino acid sequence alone) has been a central unresolved question for many decades in the 20th and the early 21st century. However, as our knowledge gradually expanded with the availability of more and more experimentally determined structures, new methods became available. Although we still cannot predict the structure of every possible polymer based on their monomers alone, the geometry of natural proteins can now be reasonably guessed using homology-based approaches. The application of machine learning and stateof-the-art neural nets and language models resulted in the creation of the AlphaFold2 algorithm (1), which demonstrates an unprecedented breakthrough in protein structure prediction.  

Nowhere is structure prediction more welcome, than in protein groups where structural studies are cumbersome and difficult, such as membrane-embedded or transmembrane (TM) proteins. The functions of transmembrane proteins are diverse, and the majority of current therapeutic drug targets are membrane proteins. Although they constitute around $20\text{\textperthousand}$ of the proteome of different organisms (2,3), experimental 3D structures for these molecules are underrepresented about tenfold compared to non-TM proteins (4), because structural studies on them are difficult and expensive. The lipid bilayer divides the molecular environment of a TM protein into three different phases (two aqueous and one lipid-filled intramembrane compartment) that the very same protein will experience, while also intersecting phase boundaries. Proper embedding of natural proteins requires a multi-step folding process (5). Membrane proteins are also radically different from their cytosolic or secreted counterparts in that they interface the outer and inner aqueous phase with a hydrophilic, but the lipid-filled membrane compartment with a hydrophobic surface at the same time. Finally, there are a lot of geometric restraints associated with the way a protein chain can traverse the membrane. The overwhelming majority of TM proteins contain highly hydrophobic alpha-helical segments, in a preferentially perpendicular orientation that roughly match the height of the complete membrane. With a relative scarcity of complete, 3D experimental templates, these physicochemical restraints are difficult to follow by currently available, machine learning-based prediction methods (6–8).  

For experimentally determined membrane protein structures, there are already two methods (TMDET (9) and  

PPM (10)) that can reconstruct the position of the original membrane plane for alpha-helical transmembrane proteins. Using these algorithms on purely prediction-based protein structures is fairly straightforward, and they also provide a simple geometric approach for the assessment of model quality. We can also compare these theoretical models with low-resolution global topology predictions (6–8). The latter algorithms are fairly accurate and provide an additional basis for quality assessment. We are well aware that other TM proteins also exist, such as pore-forming beta-barrels, with many examples consisting of multiple chains. As the latter lack clearly defined hydrophilic interior and hydrophobic exterior sides, they cannot be confidently identified using monomeric AF2 structures only. Beta barrels and some multimeric pore-forming toxins were therefore not included in the presented TmAlphaFold database, only genuine alpha-helical TM proteins. TmAlphaFold database not only provides an open-access resource to visualize the likely orientation of 215 844 alpha-helical TM proteins regarding the membrane plane, but also displays any structural conflicts the AlphaFold2 models might have.  

# DATA RESOURCES AND METHODOLOGY  

# Resources  

The AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AFDB) (11) was used as a source of AlphaFold2 predicted structures. We ran the CCTOP (6), TOPCONS2 (7) consensus methods and DeepTMHMM (8) algorithms on our cluster to discriminate between TM and non-TM proteins. We used CCTOP to predict the topology of TM proteins, however, we replaced the older version of signal peptide prediction with SignalP6 (12). Structures were sliced into fragments based on their Predicted Alignment Error matrix using the Agglomerative Clustering function of the Sklearn python package (https://scikit-learn.org/). Helical residues were defined using DSSP (13). The TMDET algorithm (9) was used to detect the membrane plane in the AlphaFold structures (and in their fragments).  

# Technical details  

The web page of TmAlphaFold database was written in PHP using the Laravel framework with Livewire package, which makes working with user interactions more manageable. To visualize topology data over amino acid sequences, protvista packages were utilized from EBI web components GitHub repository (https://github.com/ ebi-webcomponents/nightingale), while 3D structures were visualized using a locally modified version of Mol\* (14). The modified version can show the membrane as two planes around the investigated TM protein using the results of TMDET. Sequences and topology data as well as information about protein similarities provided by BLAST (15) are stored in a MySQL database. Data can be downloaded either for each protein separately or for whole genomes as gzipped packages. For programmable access to the database, an API is also provided.  

# RESULTS  

# Data processing  

We used a combination of three state-of-the-art prediction methods to select TM proteins from all protein structures deposited into AFDB. Our internal tests showed that CCTOP has the highest sensitivity, however, the intersection of the three prediction methods produced better specificity (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Therefore, we accepted a protein as TM if either (i) all three prediction methods detected a TM segment, or (ii) the manually curated cases where CCTOP predicted a TM segment, but TOPCONS2 or DeepTMHMM did not find membrane region(s).  

In the TmAlphaFold database we reconstructed the membrane bilayer using the coordinates in the PDB files and Predicted Aligned Error files. After removing the signal peptide, we used agglomerative clustering to slice the structures into potential domains (the threshold was set to 7). We utilized the TMDET algorithm to detect the membrane bilayer in the full structure and the fragments as well. However, note that residues with low pLDDT were omitted (the default threshold was set to 70, for helical residues to 50). In most cases, the results for the fragments and the full structure were in full agreement. In case they contradicted, we created an assembly from the fragments where only compatible ones were kept (we checked if the rotations of the fragments regarding the membrane plane were similar).  

By the end, we obtained multiple individual fragments, the assembled structure and the original full structure, together with the membrane plane definitions. We found that out of these three approaches, selecting the one with the most TM segments provided the most realistic model. This is intuitively easy to understand, considering that the most common error of AF2 was to randomly position non-TM segments into the membrane plane (confusing TMDET), while the most characteristic error of fragmentation was to inadvertently split TM domains. Sometimes, however, this strategy did not yield a positive outcome, as TMDET could not detect the membrane, or the structure had a lot of geometric errors (see Quality assessment). In such cases, we masked every residue that was not predicted as TM by CCTOP, and made an attempt to find the membrane plane in the resulting structure. For a more detailed description of the algorithm see Supplementary Material or visit the webpage of TmAlphaFold database.  

# Quality assessment  

Our data processing pipeline found and reconstructed the membrane bilayer in most cases (depending on the quality of the AlphaFold2 predicted structure), however, several geometric (or topological) errors may still arise in the structures. We defined ten commonly seen problems and evaluated all the predicted structures to assess their quality. These scores are related to the quality of structures: comparing the Root Mean Square Deviation between the experimental and predicted structures (Supplementary Table 3), the higher ratio of ‘Excellent’ quality level was assigned to proteins with lower RMSD (Supplementary Figure S1). We found that signal peptides, short helical segments and low-reliability segments (or in another interpretation, intrinsically disordered regions) often fell into the membrane bilayer. The latter can produce more complicated problems, as they can also work as a linker and turn the direction of the polypeptide chain, so an ordered domain penetrates the membrane. Sometimes we detected additional membrane segments in the fragments, however, they fall outside from the membrane plane in the final result. We also compared the structure and the membrane plane to the CCTOP topology prediction result, to check if all segments were found (or if there are extra helical segments in the membrane). Using these flags, we categorize each structure as excellent, good, fair, poor or failed. Notably, these quality checks do not necessarily mean that the predicted structure is erroneous, it is up to the user to judge the structure based on the evidence. For a detailed list of all quality flags see Supplementary Material or the webpage.  

# Membrane orientation and quality assessment of membrane proteins from AF  

The TmAlphaFold database contains $215844{\mathrm{TM}}$ proteins, and in 203 077 $(94.09\%)$ the membrane bilayer is also reconstructed. In the majority of cases, the quality of the structure is excellent $(45.16\%)$ or good $(21.51\%)$ . In a lower proportion of proteins, the quality was fair $(25.08\%)$ or poor $(2.21\%)$ . In 12 767 proteins $(6.05\%)$ , the membrane bilayer could not be reconstructed. Regarding all the sequences from the 16 model organisms, 32 global health organisms and SwissProt database, ${\sim}22\%$ of the proteins contained at least one TM segment. The most abundant class is bitopic proteins $(32.42\%)$ , which are often receptors or responsible for cell adhesion. 7TM proteins are also abundant $(8.38\%)$ , especially in mammalians where the majority of them belonging to the class of GPCRs.  

# Webpage of TmAlphaFold database  

The home page of the TmAlphaFold database provides an easily accessible user interface to inspect the structures together with the reconstructed membrane plane and the detected errors. Users can search for proteins using their UniProt ID, UniProt Accession, Gene name or protein name. The results can be filtered based on the source organism, the quality of the structure (see Quality assessment), CCTOP topology prediction evidence level and the number of TM segments. Summary information about the protein structures is also available on the search results page.  

On the protein page five panels are available. The information panel shows general information about the protein: protein name, organism, subcellular localization from UniProt (16) and a hyperlink to the AFDB. Furthermore, $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{Q}}$ value determined by TMDET, evidence and reliability levels from CCTOP are all displayed. On the TM panel, the proposed topography of the protein is shown (considering TMDET result): correct TM helices are marked with yellow (re-entrant loops are orange), false positive ones are red and false negatives are blue. For a quick comparison, the CCTOP prediction result, and––if available––related structures from PDBTM (4) are also shown. Last, but not least, fragments generated by agglomerative clustering from PAE matrices (see Methods) and their membrane segments are also displayed. The ‘3D’ tab shows the AlphaFold2 structure together with the reconstructed membrane plane. Geometric errors detected from multiple quality steps are also marked (with the same color-coding as on the topography panel). On the evaluation panel, the results of quality checks are indicated. On the download tab, we provide the rotated structure (so the $Z$ axis is perpendicular to the membrane plane), the TMDET result file, the evaluation result and the CCTOP prediction results. On the download page, all data bundled by proteomes can also be downloaded as a single compressed file.  

The statistics page can be used to quickly access basic statistics of TmAlphaFold database (number of entries categorized by evaluation results, by evidence, by the number of transmembrane segments and by species). Users can also generate custom charts using any combination of the following information: quality of the structure, organisms, number of TM segments and CCTOP evidence level. Multiple charts can be added to a single page, and the link can be saved, bookmarked for later use, or shared.  

# DISCUSSION  

# Case studies  

The strength of TmAlphaFold database is the various filtering techniques, that can help to highlight the potential membrane domain. Without these steps traditional algorithms designed to find the membrane plane would fail, as other segments often penetrate the lipid bilayer. However, establishing the membrane plane is by no means straightforward in many cases, as the following examples show:  

ASAH HUMAN (Q9NR71) is a ceramidase anchored into the plasma membrane. This bitopic, type II transmembrane protein has a disordered region that connects the ceramidase domain with the TM segment. AF2 correctly predicts each segment (considering the observation that low pLDDT values correlate with intrinsic disorder (17)), however, the orientation of these segments relative to each other is problematic, as the flexible linker turns back the polypeptide chain and places the domain next to the TM region. In this case, by slicing the structure into fragments based on the Predicted Alignment Error matrix, the membrane region can be correctly identified (Figure 1A).  

PTH2R HUMAN (P49190) is a GPCR-superfamily hormone receptor with seven transmembrane helices. The protein also has an N-terminal signal peptide that is cleaved in the mature protein, although AF2 folds this stretch into the membrane domain. The C-terminal segment is predicted to be disordered (18), however, this region is also (erroneously) positioned inside the proposed membrane layer according to AF2. By filtering these segments out, the correct membrane bilayer can be reconstructed (19) (Figure 1B).  

TM14C HUMAN (Q9P0S9) is a transmembrane protein, probably involved in heme biosynthesis. AF2 predicts 4 alpha-helix in the protein, two pairs from which both could define the membrane plane. Considering the NMR structure of the protein (20), AF2 correctly identifies all secondary structure, however, their orientation relative to each other is wrong––the middle TM helix is predicted parallel to the membrane next to the interface helix, and therefore the orientation of the N-terminal TM helix compared to the

C-terminal one is wrong. NMR structures were not used to train AF2, yet it was shown that DeepMind’s algorithm is still accurate on them (21)––with a few exceptions (Figure 1C).  

# Limitations  

When constructing the TmAlphaFold database, we heavily relied on the TMDET software to detect the membrane plane. TMDET is also routinely used for maintaining the PDBTM database. However, it has a very high sensitivity with modest specificity, thus manual curation is also required. While the weekly update for PDB can be handled easily, the high number of structures from AFDB, that need to be checked is several orders of magnitude higher. Therefore, we decided to use sequence-based filtering of TM proteins. TM filtering capacity and specificity of such methods is high, yielding only a handful of false positives on our benchmarking test. However, when processing around 1 million sequences the number of false positive predictions is expected to be in the range of thousands. A few days before the manuscript submission, a new language modelbased TM protein filtering and topology prediction algorithm was released (TMbed) (22). Although it can handle a huge number of sequences in a relatively short period of time, this will only be implemented in the next version of the database.  

One limitation of our method (and in general, AFDB), is that it does not consider the quaternary structure of proteins. A high fraction of membrane proteins forms oligomer structures, however, by predicting them in monomer form both TMDET and even the AlphaFold2 algorithm might fail. Furthermore, when detecting the membrane plane, TMDET calculates the solvent accessible surface areas, which might be different for monomer and multimer versions of the proteins. Another problem arises from dynamically folded structures, such as pore-forming toxins. Unfortunately, some proteins have more than one fundamentally different, stable 3D structures, where one is cytoplasmic and the other one is membrane inserted. In these cases, AlphaFold2 tends to predict the soluble, non-membrane form. Therefore, we generally avoided the inclusion of these proteins as TM, even if a structurally unmodeled TM form might exist.  

AlphaFold2 often aims to produce compact 3D structures, that may lead to fold additional elements to the membrane domain. For example, OR1L1 HUMAN (Q8NH94) is an olfactory receptor, with seven TM regions. AF2 places an extra helical segment next to the transmembrane segments (Supplementary Figure S2a). Since there is no geometrical violation, this is not detected during the quality check as a problem. Notably, according to UniProt it is uncertain that the initiating Methionine can be found at position 1 or 51 (https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8NH94/ entry). Taking this initiation site ambiguity into account, for the shorter protein, AF2 would probably predict a correct structure.  

In some other cases AlphaFold2 does not prefer the compact structures, most notably in all-alpha structures. We found several examples, when two or more transmembrane alpha helices are modeled as one long helix. The most spectacular is RCF1 YEAST (Q03713) (Supplementary Figure S2b). This is a mitochondrial protein with an experimentally determined NMR structure (5nv8) that shows five TM helices, bringing another example where structural problems raises when no x-ray structure is available. Although correctly recognizing an alpha-helix rich structure, AF2 only positions two TM helices into positions that overlap reasonably with that of the experimental structure. The rest are left as dangling outside the membrane plane, and hence they cannot be recognized as being TM by the TMDET algorithm. Non-compact structures may be also produced when there is a high fraction of low pLDDT (probably disordered) residues in the structure. E9AGZ2 LEIIN (E9AGZ2) is probably a type I TM protein from Leishmania pathogen, where all topology prediction algorithms agree in the TM segment around the 220– 240 segment (Supplementary Figure S2c). The protein has a very highly disordered extracellular part with potential amyloid-forming segments judged based on the sequence. AF2 cannot really handle the structure, long disordered regions connecting alpha-helical segments that are loosely placed within the membrane plane.  

Naturally, AF2 is not equipped to deal with structures that has no reliable experimental template for (divergent domains or understudied protein structures). As an example, CLCL1 HUMAN (Q8IZS7) encodes a fast-evolving immune receptor lectin (23) with orthologs found in most other mammals: however, due to its unexpectedly high rate of amino acid exchange, AF2 fails to confidently predict its initial segment as a signal-anchor (TM segment). This example illustrates that in the case of divergent sequences, AF2 can also be unreliable at finding TM helices (Supplemantary Figure S2d).  

We are well aware that even predominantly alpha-helical membrane proteins can sometimes have non-helical segments also inserted into the membrane. Most of these segments are just re-entrant loops, but fully transiting segments are not unheard of. They most commonly occur at the core of multi-pass TM proteins, where - shielded from the environment––arbitrary folds can occur, including even beta-sheets. ABCB ASPFU (Q4WT65) is an ATPbinding cassette transporter, providing an example where most of the TM domain is folded correctly, except one TM helix (902–922)––according to the Predicted Alignment Error matrix this region could not be reliably aligned to the rest of the TM domain––our fragmentation also handles it as a separate entity (Supplementary Figure S2e). Notably, OmegaFold, a newly developed alignmentfree folding method (https://github.com/HeliXonProtein/ OmegaFold) predicts this region as a regular alpha-helix. This example suggests that the alignment sometimes struggles on TM regions, advocating the necessity of membrane protein specific alignment algorithms or the utilization of alignment free algorithms. Further examples, where TM regions were predicted to have non-helical secondary structure include the Escherichia coli urea permease URAA ECOLI (P0AGM7, Supplementary Figure S2f), the cyanobacterial bicarbonate transporter BICA SYNY3 (Q55415, Supplementary Figure $\mathbf{S}2\mathbf{g})$ or the human voltage sensor prestin S26A5 HUMAN (P58743, Supplementary Figure S2h) (24–26). These rare, unusual TM segments (that sometimes might represent genuine, experimental structures) will be labeled as ‘non-transmembrane segment in membrane’ under the current algorithm, thus critical assessment is advised for all users.  

Finally, AF2 is not equipped to deal with structures it has barely any template for, such as stand-alone TM segments (this is a recurring problem for single-pass membrane proteins). Therefore, clashes with intra- or extracellular domains or weakly predicted helices are very common for single-pass TM proteins. This problem is compounded for TM segments with an unusual amino acid composition (such as Gly- or Ala- rich TM segments), where even the geometry prediction of AF2 can fail, giving non-helical conformations. Thus, even if the segment in question is unequivocally identified as a TM segment (and not a signal peptide) by other methods, it might still not be detectable on the 3D folded structure. On the other hand, these issues are encountered with multi-pass TM proteins less commonly.  

# Comparison with other resources  

During the construction of our database, we noted that for many of the TM proteins, predicted 3D structures are also available from Membranome 3.0 (27). This database only focuses on single-pass membrane proteins but processes them very differently from our methods. Unlike Membranome 3.0, we did not aim to ‘repair’ the AF2-predicted membrane proteins by fragmenting and reorienting them. TmAlphaFold database only applies the membrane segment prediction on intact, original AF2 output structures, and indicate slight errors without the explicit aim of ‘repairing’ faulty geometries. This process can be dangerous if the protein is not proven to be a membrane protein with all certainty. On the other hand, our resource is aimed to include all TM proteins, hence providing a much higher coverage for proteomes than Membranome 3.0.  

Our method found $87\%$ of the 5758 TM helices that were listed in Membranome 3.0, reflecting a good agreement between the two databases. A few positive cases showed the presence of more than one TM helices and multi-pass topology for the protein. When our algorithm was not able to find the TM helix described in Membranome 3.0, it was not possible to define the membrane plane. One of the most significant reasons for failed TM identifications is the overprediction of signal peptides, hindered the erroneous detection of non-cleavable signal anchors (e.g. in a lot of Golgi-resident glycosyl transferases).  

# FURTHER DIRECTIONS  

The current version of the TmAlphaFold database is based on the v3 release of the AFDB. We plan to regularly update the database upon changes in AFDB. During the development of the current version, a new release (v4) of AFDB became available, increasing the number of structures from ${\sim}1$ million to ${\sim}200$ million (https://github.com/deepmind/ alphafold). Although this change is not yet reflected in the current version of TmAlphaFold database, we plan to keep adding structures to precisely reflect the membrane world of predicted AF2 structures.

# Abstract  

Comparing genomic and biological characteristics across multiple species is essential to using model systems to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying human biology and disease and to translate mechanistic insights from studies in model organisms for clinical applications. Building a scalable knowledge commons platform that supports cross-species comparison of rich, expertly curated knowledge regarding gene function, phenotype, and disease associations available for model organisms and humans is the primary mission of the Alliance of Genome Resources (the Alliance). The Alliance is a consortium of seven model organism knowledgebases (mouse, rat, yeast, nematode, zebrafish, frog, fruit fly) and the Gene Ontology resource. The Alliance uses a common set of gene ortholog assertions as the basis for comparing biological annotations across the organisms represented in the Alliance. The major types of knowledge associated with genes that are represented in the Alliance database currently include gene function, phenotypic alleles and variants, human disease associations, pathways, gene expression, and both protein–protein and genetic interactions. The Alliance has enhanced the ability of researchers to easily compare biological annotations for common data types across model organisms and human through the implementation of shared programmatic access mechanisms, data-specific web pages with a unified “look and feel”, and interactive user interfaces specifically designed to support comparative biology. The modular infrastructure developed by the Alliance allows the resource to serve as an extensible “knowledge commons” capable of expanding to accommodate additional model organisms.  

# Introduction  

The Alliance of Genome Resources (the Alliance) is a consortium of seven model organism knowledgebases and the Gene Ontology resource. The mission of the Alliance is to support comparative genomics as a means to investigate the genetic and genomic basis of human biology, health, and disease. The Alliance seeks to serve a diverse community of biomedical researchers including basic scientists, clinicians, and data scientists. To promote sustainability of core community data resources, the Alliance has implemented and maintains an extensible “knowledge commons platform” for comparative genomics using modular infrastructure components that can be used by a wide range of multiple model organism genome knowledgebases (Alliance of Genome  

Resources 2019, 2020; Howe et  al. 2018). The history of how Model Organism Databases and the Gene Ontology Consortium united to form the Alliance of Genome Resources has been published previously (Alliance of Genome Resources 2019, 2022). In 2023, the Alliance was recognized as a Core Global Biodata Resource by the Global Biodata Coalition (Anderson et al. 2017) (Fig. 1).  

The Alliance of Genome Resources is organized as two interdependent units: Alliance Central and the Alliance Knowledge Centers (Alliance of Genome Resources 2019) (Fig. 1). Alliance Central is responsible for developing and maintaining the software for data access and for the coordination of concept modeling and data harmonization activities across the Knowledge Centers. The ultimate goal of Alliance Central is to reduce redundancy in systems administration and software development for model organism data resources and to deploy a unified ‘look and feel’ for access to and display of data types and annotations in common across diverse model organisms. Model organism-specific knowledgebases serve as Alliance Knowledge Centers. Knowledge Centers are responsible for expert curation of data and for submission of data to Alliance Central using standardized data formats and annotation standards. Knowledge Centers also are responsible for organism-specific user support activities and for providing access to data types not yet supported by Alliance Central. The founding Alliance Knowledge Centers are Saccharomyces Genome Database (Engel et al. 2022), WormBase (Davis et al. 2022), FlyBase (Gramates et al. 2022), Mouse Genome Informatics (Ringwald et al. 2022), the Zebrafish Information Network (Bradford et al. 2023), Rat Genome Database (Vedi et al. 2023), and the Gene Ontology Consortium (Gene Ontology et al. 2023). The newest member, Xenbase (Fisher et al. 2023), joined the Alliance consortium in 2022. Annotations for human genes are acquired from numerous resources including the Alliance Knowledge Centers, NCBI’s dbSNP (Smigielski et al. 2000), the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee (Yates et al. 2021), Disease Ontology (Schriml et al. 2022), Human Phenotype Ontology (Kohler et al. 2021), Orphanet (Rath et al. 2012), OMIM (Hamosh et al. 2021), BioGrid (Oughtred et al. 2021), and Reactome (Gillespie et al. 2022).

Fig. 1   A graphical representation of the organizational units that genome annotations provided by the Knowledge Centers. Alliance comprise the Alliance of Genome Resources consortium. Knowledge Central is the platform for delivery of harmonized biological annoCenters (aka, model organism databases or MODs) are organism- tations to a diverse user community via the Alliance web portal and specific resources for expert curation of knowledge about a model Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) organism’s genome. Data from external resources are integrated with  

Although the model organism-centric knowledgebases that comprise the Alliance all contain similar data types (e.g., gene function, gene expression, genetic variation, phenotype, and human disease associations), the resources differ in how these data types are modeled and displayed to end users. These differences present significant challenges to the development of common schemas and uniform user interfaces for data types across different organisms. To address these challenges, a major activity within the Alliance is the harmonization of biological concepts which can be represented in a common schema. For example, all of the model organisms currently in the Alliance consortium have a concept of a transgene. For some model organisms, a transgene is represented as a random insertion of a construct but does not include gene trap alleles. For other organisms, gene traps are included in the representation of transgenes. For yet other model organisms, transgenes are represented as the random insertion of any foreign DNA into the genome, including the construct. To implement a common data model and unified display for transgenes, a harmonized data model was developed in which transgenes are represented by two separate concepts—the transgene construct and the transgene allele—and the specific relationships between the concepts. In the harmonized Alliance model, a transgene construct is defined as the DNA used to create a transgenic allele. The transgene construct has explicit relationships to genes, gene segments, and to the transgenic alleles created using the construct. The transgenic allele represents a construct in the context of a genome. Transgenic alleles have relationships to constructs and genomes. Because the transgene data type is harmonized, data from all of the model organism-specific Knowledge Centers can be represented in a uniform manner on the Alliance web portal (Fig. 2).

Biological annotations obtained from data-specific resources that are not members of the Alliance consortium are also incorporated into Alliance Central. For example, the Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets (BioGrid) (Oughtred et al. 2021) and the International Molecular Exchange consortium (IMex) (Porras et al. 2022) are primary sources of molecular and genetic interaction data. Reactome (Gillespie et al. 2022) is leveraged as one source of pathway and reaction data. The Alliance Central practice of leveraging existing community resources also extends to software for data analysis and visualization. Externally developed tools such as Intermine (Smith et al. 2012), JBrowse (Buels et al. 2016), Apollo (Dunn et al. 2019), SequenceServer (Priyam et al. 2019), and the Reactome pathway viewer (Gillespie et al. 2022) are key components of the knowledge commons platform providing useful functionality for the Alliance user community and allowing software development efforts within Alliance Central to be focused on tools and interfaces for comparative biology and genomics that provide added value to the biomedical research community. A number of the software components of the host organism following species-specific guidelines. Expressed components represent the genetic elements expressed by the construct which may be full or partial genes and may include both protein-coding and non protein-coding genes. Knock-down targets are elements in the transgene designed to interfere with the expression of another gene. The regulatory regions component includes genetic elements driving the expression of entities in the construct (e.g., upstream activation sequence, human cytomegalovirus, etc.)  

used by the Alliance (e.g., Apollo, JBrowse, Intermine) were developed under the auspices of the Generic Model Organism Database project (http://​gmod.​org/​wiki/​Main_​Page).  

The Alliance resource has a unique and complementary role relative to other informatics resources that support comparative biology such as NCBI’s new Comparative Genomics Resource (CGR; https://​www.​ncbi.​nlm.​nih.​gov/​compa rative-​genom​ics-​resou​rce/). Whereas the CGR is focused on developing analysis tools and resources for sequence-based genome comparisons across a large number of species, the Alliance focuses on standardized annotations, harmonized biological concepts, and comparison of biological knowledge. The CGR supports comparative sequence analysis for all eukaryotes whereas the Alliance is primarily focused on model organisms used widely in biomedical research. The CGR resource integrates the standardized gene summaries from the Alliance and follows nomenclature and ontology standards developed and maintained by Alliance members. For sequence analysis, the Alliance leverages sequencebased analysis tools developed and maintained by the CGR such as BLAST.  

The approach to data management for the Alliance and its members aligns with modern FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) (Wilkinson et al. 2016) which are designed to ensure that data are structured to be machine accessible with minimal or no human intervention. Examples of how the Alliance conforms to FAIR principles includes the use of unique, persistent identifiers for data entities and meta-data, the use of well-recognized and accepted community standard bio-ontologies and vocabularies for knowledge representation, clear data use licensing guidelines, and the availability of open and freely available application programming interfaces (APIs) for data retrieval.  

# The Alliance of Genome Resources web portal  

The Alliance web portal (www.​allia​ncege​nome.​org) provides a single point of access to the expertly curated and harmonized annotations from diverse model organisms and humans. The portal supports keyword searching within six categories: Gene, Allele/Variant, Disease Models, Gene Ontology annotation, Disease, and High Throughput Data (HTP) (Fig. 3). Results of keyword searches are displayed as faceted counts for the six categories. The counts are updated as search parameters are refined by the user. The Alliance database content summary as of the most recent release of the portal (v. 5.4.0) is provided in Table 1.  

Table 1   Content summary for the alliance of genome resources web portal (v. 5.4.0)

Data at the portal is available currently for human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, frog, nematode, yeast, and fruit fly  

Search results are displayed with a consistent look and feel and layout of data for all organisms represented in the Alliance. To facilitate the comparison of biological knowledge across multiple species, annotations for orthology, function, phenotype, and disease are displayed in the portal use an interactive comparative annotation ribbon (Fig. 4). The ribbon display allows users to quickly assess the degree to which annotations are similar across multiple species. The cells in the ribbon are linked to tabular summaries with egory of interest which leads to the display of new facet categories and record counts. Alternatively, users can scroll through the search results and select a gene of interest to navigate to the relevant detail page in the web portal

Fig. 4   Screenshot showing the interactive annotation summary ribbon for functional annotations of orthologs of the human BMP4 gene. Each row in the ribbon is a different species. Each column is a grouping of terms from the molecular function, biological process, and cellular component categories of the Gene Ontology. The shading in the cells reflects the number of annotations to terms represented by  

details about the relevant ontology terms and sources of evidence for the annotations.  

In addition to support for keyword searches, the Alliance web portal provides users with downloadable files of gene description summaries and annotations in commonly used data formats (e.g., JSON, tab-separated, GFF, etc.). Downloads are currently available for disease annotations, gene expression, molecular and genetic interactions, orthology, alleles, and short gene descriptions. Sequence variants that are associated with documented phenotypic consequences are available as files in Variant Call Format (VCF) format. The downloadable data files are updated regularly. The file headers display the Alliance database version and the date the file was generated. Programmatic access to annotations in the Alliance is provided through an OpenAPI Specification (OAS). The schemas for the API-accessible data classes are available in a browsable format on the website.  

Users looking to search for more than one gene at a time or in managing lists of genes can use AllianceMine. AllianceMine uses the InterMine data warehouse system (Smith et al. 2012). Although AllianceMine can be used without creating an account, having an account allows users to save gene lists and the outputs of gene list operations (i.e., intersection, combine, difference, subtraction).  

Schedules for public data releases at the Alliance Knowledge Centers range from daily to monthly. Data submitted from Alliance Knowledge Centers and other external data sources are refreshed monthly at the Alliance web portal. These monthly data releases are occasionally suspended when the column. The darker the shading, the more annotations. Selecting a cell in the ribbon results in a table that shows the specific ontology terms and evidence used to make the annotation. Users can use the orthology settings to control which organisms are shown in the graphic  

major software changes to the Alliance infrastructure are being implemented. Release notes are accessed from the News menu in the header that document changes to data release frequencies, user interfaces, portal functionality, and any known issues with Alliance resources (https://​www.​allia​ncege​nome.​org/ relea​se-​notes).  

# Orthology  

Gene orthology is fundamental to comparative genomics. The Alliance uses a common set of orthologs as the foundation for comparing functional, phenotype, and disease annotations across model organisms and humans. Alliance orthology assertions are based on outputs from algorithms/ methods that have been benchmarked by the Quest for Orthologs Consortium (Nevers et al. 2022) and integrated using the DRSC Integrative Ortholog Prediction Tool (DIOPT) (Hu et al. 2011). These ortholog assertions are subsequently supplemented with manually curated ortholog inferences from the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee (for human and mouse genes) (Yates et al. 2021), Xenbase (for frog genes), and ZFIN (for zebrafish genes). Manual curation is particularly useful for ensuring accuracy and completeness of orthology representation for species such as Xenopus and Danio where there has been extensive genome duplication.  

# Gene detail pages  

Organism-specific gene detail pages in the Alliance web portal are the primary ‘hub’ of functional and biological annotations. All gene pages include a summary section with a short description of what the gene does and its association with phenotypes and/or human disease. The gene function descriptions are generated automatically by an algorithm that leverages expertly curated structured ontology term annotations associated with genes (Kishore et al. 2020). In addition to a gene summary, the standard sections of gene pages include Orthology, Function, Pathways, Phenotypes, Disease Associations, Models, Alleles and Variants, Transgenic Alleles, Sequence Feature Viewer, Gene Expression, Molecular Interactions, and Genetic Interactions. The two primary means for displaying annotations in these categories are a table view and an annotation ribbon display. Brief descriptions for each section of the gene detail pages and examples of the display paradigms are provided below. A list of the specific ontologies used at the Alliance along with licensing information is provided in Table 2 and on the Privacy, Warranty, and Licensing page (https://​www.​allia ncege​nome.​org/​priva​cy-​warra​nty-​licen​sing) at the Alliance web portal.  

# Orthology  

The default display of orthologs reflects the output of the most stringent criteria based on DIOPT score; however, options are provided for researchers to select less stringent criteria and/or orthologs predicted by a user-selected subset of the available inference methods (Fig. 5). The Alliance orthologs are available as a downloadable file and can also be accessed programmatically via the Alliance Central API service.  

# Functional annotations (Gene Ontology)  

Annotations to terms for Biological Process, Molecular Function, and Cellular Component from the Gene Ontology are summarized for high level GO categories using the Alliance annotation ribbon display paradigm (Fig. 4). Each cell in the ribbon is shaded if there is an annotation for a term in the category. The deeper the color of the shading, the more annotations are associated with the terms in the category. Selecting a cell generates a table that lists all of the annotation terms with evidence codes and sources for the annotation(s). By expanding the display to include additional organisms, the functional annotations for orthologs are displayed as additional rows.  

# Pathways  

Representation of pathways is supported using visualization widgets from Reactome (Gillespie et al. 2022) and from GO Causal Annotation Model (GO-CAM) curation (Thomas et al. 2019) which have been integrated into relevant gene pages on the Alliance web portal (Fig. 6). GOCAMs are models of biological processes constructed by linking together individual GO annotations. The simplified models shown on Alliance gene pages are linked to model details at the Gene Ontology resource. The interactive Reactome pathways and reaction graphics on Alliance gene pages are linked to the Reactome database for additional information about the reactions and pathways.  

# Phenotype annotations  

If an organism has curated phenotype annotations, the annotations are displayed in a tabular format in the Phenotypes section of the gene detail page. The table includes columns for the phenotype term from the relevant phenotype ontology, annotation details, and the reference(s) for the annotation. Experimental conditions such as chemical, dietary, or physical interventions that contribute to or modify an observed phenotype are included in such annotation details are available. Although the display format is uniform for all organisms represented in the Alliance, the details displayed for phenotype annotations differ by organism. In mouse, for example, phenotype annotations are associated with genotypes and genetic backgrounds. In zebrafish, the phenotype annotations are associated with a fish. In Drosophila, phenotype annotations are associated with alleles.  

# Disease associations and models  

Similar to the display for functional annotations, the summary of disease associations for a gene across available data across model organisms is displayed as an interactive ribbon (Fig. 7). Selecting a column in the ribbon generates a tabular summary of the annotations that includes annotation type, evidence, and source. Of the more than 350,000 disease model annotations available in version 5.4.0 of the Alliance website (Table 1), over 60,000 are from experimentally derived models. More than 28,800 annotations represent either biomarkers of disease or disease associations based on orthology to a human gene.  

Disease Models are specific strains, genotypes, animals, etc. that support investigation into the genetic and genomic basis of phenotypes and disease. Models defined as genotypes that are associated with specific observable phenotypes and/or that have characteristics that reflect biological properties of specific human diseases or syndromes. As the harmonization for the concept of a model across different model systems is still being discussed, the details for model genotypes displayed on Alliance gene detail page are available as links back to the relevant Knowledge Center.

# Alleles, variants, and transgenes  

Alleles and sequence variants for a gene are provided in a table format. Variants are defined as sequence differences at a single position or in contiguous nucleotides relative to a reference sequence. Variants are expressed in standard Human Genome Variation Society (den Dunnen et al. 2016) format and annotated with the variant type (e.g., SNP), variant identifier, and molecular consequence annotations generated by the Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) tool (McLaren et al. 2016). Alleles are defined as alternative forms of a gene and may be associated one or more sequence variants. Alleles are displayed with official nomenclature and synonyms and are linked to detail pages at the Alliance that summarize phenotype and disease associations when relevant.  

The details provided for transgenic alleles varies by model organism but may include the symbol, the transgene construct, expressed components, knock-down targets, and regulatory regions. Transgenic alleles are linked to Alliance detail pages that provide transgene construct details and summaries of any annotated phenotype and/or disease associations.  

gency, species displayed, and orthology call methods used. Alliance orthologs are also available as a downloadable file and via the Alliance API  

# Sequence feature viewer  

Every gene detail page includes a graphical summary of transcripts annotated to the gene. When relevant, the location of sequence variants associated with alleles of the gene are also displayed. Population level variants (polymorphisms) determined by high-throughput sequencing and/or large-scale genotyping technologies are not displayed in the feature viewer because of the volume and density of these data. High throughput variants and additional genome features can be viewed using the Alliance JBrowse instance (Buels et al. 2016). A link to JBrowse is provided under the sequence feature viewer widget.  

# Gene expression  

Expression data displayed using the standard Alliance interactive ribbon display. The data reflect developmental and cellular/anatomical expression of genes in wild-type backgrounds. As with the other comparative annotation ribbons on the gene detail pages, the shading of the cells is indicative of the number of annotations supporting the expression information, not levels of transcription or translation. Cells with red slashes indicate that a particular anatomical structure is not biologically relevant for the organism.

# Molecular and genetic interactions  

Information about molecular and genetic interactions are available for genes from humans and all seven model organisms in the Alliance. The interaction data include curated information provided by two Alliance Knowledge Centers (WormBase and FlyBase) and two external interaction data resources: BioGrid (Oughtred et al. 2021) and IMex (Porras et al. 2022). Currently the interaction data are presented as a table but future plans for Alliance Central include the implementation of a graphical display for these data.  

# Relating model organisms to human disease  

Human disease annotations in the Alliance use standardized terms from the Disease Ontology (Schriml et al. 2022). As of version 5.4.0 of the Alliance database, over 11,200 DO terms are associated with model organism and/or human annotations (Table  1). Using the Alliance web portal, researchers can access disease annotations in one of two ways: keyword searching or via the interactive annotation ribbon graphic provided on gene detail pages.  

To facilitate keyword searches for a disease of interest, an autocomplete function dynamically generates a list of potential matching terms as the user types a term into the search form. Disease detail pages include a summary header containing the disease term definition from DO with cross references to other terminologies and ontologies. The multi-organism annotations available on disease detail pages include associated genes, alleles, and disease models. For associated genes, the nature of the association, the type of evidence for the association and the source(s) used to support the gene association are provided in an interactive table (Fig. 8). The types of disease gene associations listed include genes implicated as causal for a disease and those that are associated as biomarkers for a disease. Users can filter the rows displayed in the associated genes table by any of the column headers and can customize the sorting order by disease, gene, or species. Similar information and filter and sort functionality are provided for the associated alleles and associated models tables. Each of the tables shown on the disease detail pages can be downloaded as a tab-separated file.

# Extending the platform  

One of the overarching goals of Alliance Central is to establish a knowledgebase platform capable of supporting model organism communities beyond the founding members of the Alliance consortium. A number of the software components developed by the Alliance have been adopted by external database resources, including the short gene descriptions, the Sequence Feature Viewer, and the annotation ribbon display. To demonstrate the extensibility of the platform to other model systems, the Alliance family of model organism databases recently was extended to include Xenbase, the model organism database for Xenopus sp.  

Xenopus is a tetrapod model organism that occupies a key evolutionary position between the mammalian models and zebrafish already represented in the Alliance. Two species of Xenopus are now represented in the Alliance: The African clawed frog ( $X.$ . laevis) and the Western clawed frog (X. tropicalis). Both Xenopus species are widely studied as models for developmental and cell biology. The African clawed frog, X. laevis (abbreviated Xla in the Alliance) is an allotetraploid $2n=36$ ) of hybrid origin. The resulting X. laevis genome has a set of ‘long’ and ‘short’ chromosomes and gene symbols are therefore appended with ‘.L’ or ‘. $s^{,}$ denoting on which chromosome pair they reside. The second Xenopus species, the Western clawed frog X. tropicalis (Xtr), is a conventional diploid $(2n=20)$ , and is increasingly used in modeling of human disease.  

A key step in the integration of Xenopus into the Alliance was the modification of the representation of orthologs in the Alliance. Orthology assertions for $X$ . tropicalis were generated from DIOPT. Orthology assertions for $X.$ . laevis were provided by Xenbase curators and are displayed as coming from the source, “Xenbase” on the orthology summary table. Data for both of the Xenopus species are available on gene detail pages, including feature gene descriptions, relationships to orthologs in other model organisms, disease associations for frog genes, gene expression, and a Sequence Feature Viewer.  

# User support and community engagement  

User support and engagement for the Alliance features a Help Desk, tutorials, an active social media presence, and an on-line discussion forum. Through the on-line forum researchers can share announcements about upcoming meetings and job postings and initiate dialog about organism-specific reagents and methods on the forum. From the Help menu on the Alliance home page researchers will find an extensive FAQ, glossary of terms, video tutorials, and on-line documentation describing how to access and use Alliance resources.  

The Alliance offers workshops comprised lectures, demos, and interactive tutorials on a regular basis. Workshops are customized to the research interests and needs of the audience. To inquire about hosting an Alliance workshop (virtually or in person), email help $@$ alliancegenome. org.

# Summary and future directions  

Prior to the formation of the Alliance of Genome Resources consortium and the Alliance Central knowledge commons platform, researchers seeking to compare biological and functional annotations across different model organisms were typically faced with the daunting task of navigating multiple web sites, each with its own unique style for user interfaces and APIs for programmatic data access. The Alliance of Genome Resources is transforming comparative genomics through the implementation of uniform display of and access to harmonized genetic and genomic data across diverse model organisms and human. Alliance resources allow researchers to easily find, access, compare, and analyze data across multiple species. The modular nature of the Alliance Central platform is designed specifically to allow extension of the resource to other model organisms which will benefit model organism research communities that lack centralized informatics resources by providing cost-effective infrastructure and data management practices that conform to FAIR principles (Wilkinson et al. 2016).  

Future directions for the Alliance include the incorporation of additional intensively-studied model organisms into the platform, the continued harmonization of biological concepts, and refinement and expansion of novel interfaces and analysis tools in support of comparative biology and genomics. A major initiative currently underway within Alliance Central is the implementation of a centralized literature curation system that uses machine learning and artificial intelligence methods to (1) identify published manuscripts with data relevant to the mission of the Alliance and (2) map concepts and entities described in scientific publications to standard nomenclatures and ontology terms. This initiative builds on a large body of prior work among Alliance members to improve the efficiency and scalability of expert curation of knowledge published in the scientific literature (Hirschman et al. 2010; Karamanis et al. 2008; Liu et al. 2015; Muller et al. 2018; Ringwald et al. 2022).

# ABSTRACT  

REPAIRtoire is the first comprehensive database resource for systems biology of DNA damage and repair. The database collects and organizes the following types of information: (i) DNA damage linked to environmental mutagenic and cytotoxic agents, (ii) pathways comprising individual processes and enzymatic reactions involved in the removal of damage, (iii) proteins participating in DNA repair and (iv) diseases correlated with mutations in genes encoding DNA repair proteins. REPAIRtoire provides also links to publications and external databases. REPAIRtoire contains information about eight main DNA damage checkpoint, repair and tolerance pathways: DNA damage signaling, direct reversal repair, base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, mismatch repair, homologous recombination repair, nonhomologous end-joining and translesion synthesis. The pathway/protein dataset is currently limited to three model organisms: Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens. The DNA repair and tolerance pathways are represented as graphs and in tabular form with descriptions of each repair step and corresponding proteins, and individual entries are cross-referenced to supporting literature and primary databases. REPAIRtoire can be queried by the name of pathway, protein, enzymatic complex, damage and disease. In addition, a tool for drawing custom DNA–protein complexes is available online.  

# REPAIRtoire is freely available and can be accessed at http://repairtoire.genesilico.pl/.  

# INTRODUCTION  

DNA repair processes are of crucial importance for the maintenance of the genetic information of all organisms. The stability of the genome is constantly endangered by environmental agents, endogenous metabolic processes, e.g. reactive species inside cells, and errors of cellular processes involving DNA. Modifications of DNA can lead to mutations, which alter the coding sequence of DNA and can lead to cancer in humans and other mammals. Other DNA lesions interfere with normal cellular transactions, such as DNA replication or transcription, and are deleterious to the cell (1,2). To counteract DNA damage, organisms have evolved various damage prevention and repair systems (3–7). These systems ensure the stability of DNA and accurate transmission of genetic information by protecting the genome against a large number of different chemical and structural alterations. At the same time, random changes in DNA are viewed as a main source of genetic variability, and thus a driving force for evolution. In multicellular organisms changes in the DNA sequence and structure are responsible for e.g. differential production of antibodies by the immune system (8). Therefore, DNA repair mechanisms have to balance the noxious against the beneficial effects of alterations in the genome sequence and chemical structure.  

It has been proposed that DNA damage from endogenous sources gives rise to 20 000 lesions per mammalian cell per day, most of the lesions being deaminations, spontaneous hydrolysis of the $N\mathrm{.}$ -glycosidic bond, alkylations, and damage by reactive oxygen or nitrogen species and lipid peroxidation products (9–13). Lesions are also caused by errors in DNA metabolic processes, including the formation of single- and double-strand breaks, the collapse of replication forks, and the introduction of modified nucleic acid bases during DNA replication. Counting all together, daily $10^{16}–10^{\overline{{18}}}$ repair events occur in a healthy adult man $10^{\overline{{12}}}$ cells) (14). Despite the protection provided by these mechanisms some of the damage escapes repair, and in consequence leads to mutations, ageing and various diseases, including carcinogenesis and neurodegeneration (15–19).  

DNA repair is a very complicated process, involving many factors. For instance to date, 168 genes that encode proteins involved in DNA repair have been identified in the human genome (18–20). They are involved in diverse processes, starting from detection of a damage site in the DNA, through several steps of enzymatic transformation of the damaged DNA, to recombination and signaling to stop the cell cycle or initiate apoptosis. Another form of dealing with the DNA damage is lesion bypass, which facilitates continuation of replication even when irremovable modifications occur, but does not guarantee proper recreation of the original sequence and frequently leads to mutation generated by translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases.  

The numerous chemical and structural transformations leading from damaged DNA to repaired DNA can be described as pathways, comprising series of reaction steps. Currently known DNA damage signaling (DDS), repair and damage tolerance pathways can be divided into eight categories:  

. DDS: induced in response to the DNA damage caused by some endogenous and environmental agents;   
. Direct reversal repair (DDR): directly restores the native nucleotide residue by removing the non-native chemical modification;   
. Base-excision repair (BER): initiated by excision of modified base from the DNA. Depending on the length of DNA resynthesis, the pathway is subdivided into two sub-pathways: short-path (SP-BER) or long-path (LP-BER);   
. Nucleotide excision repair (NER): removes bulky damage from the DNA. The damage from the active strand of transcribed genes is removed by transcription coupled repair (TCR)–NER, while global genome repair (GGR)–NER removes damage present elsewhere in the genome;   
. Mismatch repair (MMR): postreplicational DNA repair that removes errors introduced during the replication (misinserted nucleotides, small loops, insertions, deletions);   
. Homologous recombination repair (HRR): repair of DNA double-strand breaks using the homologous DNA strand as a template for resynthesis;   
. Non-homologous end joining repair (NHEJ): ligation of ends resulting from DNA double-strand breaks (including the more error-prone microhomology end joining (MMEJ) mechanism;  

Translesion synthesis (TLS): damage-tolerance pathway that employs specialized polymerases to replicate across lesions in order to finish replication despite DNA damage.  

Each of these pathways can be represented as a series of enzymatic transformations between different DNA structures, catalyzed by a dedicated system of proteins. It must be emphasized that DNA repair pathways are connected to each other, i.e. they can share some steps and/or proteins involved (14). As a consequence, DNA repair proteins rarely work in isolation in the cell, and their activity is dependent on other components of DNA repair systems. Therefore, knowledge of both the entire DNA repair systems and their components is critical to our understanding of how cells controls and repairs the constantly occurring damage of their genomes. Many of the proteins involved in DNA repair are very well-described (including substrate specificity, kinetics, mechanisms of action and 3D structure in complex with the substrate and/or the product of its activity). Information about different factors involved in DNA repair is, however, scattered in the literature and thus far there has been no resource to organize information on DNA repair at the systems level. Moreover, there are still processes, for which an enzymatic activity is known or suspected to exist, but the genes/proteins/ enzymes proteins have not been characterized yet. As an example an enzyme that is capable of removing 5-hydroxymethyluridine, a product of thymine oxidation in human cells must exist, but to date has not been identified yet (21).  

We have developed the REPAIRtoire database as a single online resource to store and organize information about DNA repair at the systems level. The purpose of REPAIRtoire is to gather together information about all DNA repair systems and proteins from model organisms, and to facilitate the access to knowledge about correlation of human diseases with mutation in genes responsible for DNA integrity and stability as well as information about the toxic and mutagenic agents causing DNA damage.  

# DATABASE CONTENT  

Based on a comprehensive literature survey, we have compiled the following data sets:  

. A list of DNA lesions linked to environmental mutagenic and cytotoxic agents;   
. DDS, repair and tolerance pathways comprising structures of damaged DNAs and intermediates of the repair processes, connected by known transformations, usually reactions catalyzed by enzymes;   
. Proteins involved in the aforementioned transformation and Information about diseases connected with defects in DNA repair proteins.  

All data items have been curated manually and whenever possible and reasonable, we provided references to the published experimental reports and/or to other databases.  

# DATABASE ORGANIZATION AND ACCESS  

REPAIRtoire is a relational database that links together the aforementioned data sets, which can be queried via five menus, ‘DNA DAMAGE’, ‘PATHWAYS’, ‘PROTEINS’, ‘DISEASES’ and ‘PUBLICATIONS (Figure 1).  

DAMAGE: We collected information about 85 different types of damage in the DNA (as of October 14, 2010). Many of them describe general classes of damage events such as single-strand breaks or base loss that are independent of the local sequence). About 60 chemical compounds that cause DNA damage were connected to the according types of damage. Of all lesions, 36 could be connected to a single molecular structure (e.g. point mutations and nucleotide modifications such as 1-hydroxypropyl-adenine). Each type of damage is described on its own sub-page, which includes information about the potential source (e.g. spontaneous formation, intermediate in some DNA repair process, etc.), proteins that may recognize its presence in the DNA, keywords that facilitate analyzing its context, and literature links. For 36 types of damage with unique chemical structures, REPAIRtoire displays the structure in 1D (using a  

SMILE code), 2D and 3D (with the JMol JAVA applet), and provides atomic coordinates for download in the .mol format.  

PATHWAYS: This menu provides access to data about eight pathways (DDS, DDR, BER, NER, MMR, HHR, NHEJ, TLS) from three model organisms: Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens. These pathways are represented as graphs visualized with PyGraphviz (http://networkx.lanl.gov/pygraphviz/), in which the nodes represent DNA states, and the edges represent the reactions between them, e.g. enzymatic reactions. All edges of the (sub)graph, i.e. arrows that connect the images, are hyperlinked to static ‘reaction’ windows comprising one or more panels that display basic information about the selected reaction. All nodes of the graph, e.g. DNA–protein complexes at various stages of the repair process, are hyperlinked to static windows comprising detailed information about the given stage of DNA repair. All protein components of each state/ complex are also hyperlinked to individual protein pages.  

PROTEINS: As of October 14, 2010, REPAIRtoire stores information about 69, 78 and 154 proteins from E. coli, S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens, respectively, and their genes that can be assessed either via pathways or directly from the ‘PROTEINS’ menu. In the process of manual data curation, we collected the available information concerning alternative gene and protein names and amino acid sequences available in the NCBI databases (22), 3D structures available in the protein data bank (23) and various features available in other databases (e.g. information about the enzymatic function, presence of isoforms, cellular/tissue and subcellular localization, together with links to the relevant database entries). Currently the DNA repair protein data set encompasses only $E$ . coli, S. cerevisiae and $H_{\sun}$ sapiens, but will be expanded in the future and may eventually comprise all orthologs of the functionally characterized enzymes identifiable in fully sequenced genomes.

DISEASES: Thus far, we have compiled information about 40 diseases caused by the mutations in 32 genes linked to defects in DNA repair proteins. This data set is presented as a table with hyperlinks to the proteins concerned, and to the relevant entries in the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database (22). Each disease has its own subpage with a succinct description and additional links (e.g. keywords). Reciprocal links to diseases are also available in each protein field.  

KEYWORDS: This menu provides quick access to the most common keywords used to annotate the database entities according to biological processes and activities such as: DNA repair pathways, the response to DNA damage, the cell cycle checkpoint control, the DNA $N$ -glycosylase, the DNA N-glycosylase/AP-lyase, etc.  

PUBLICATIONS: Literature references to entries in the PubMed database (22) have been compiled into an additional data set, currently comprising 2613 positions.  

# IMPLEMENTATION  

REPAIRtoire has been implemented using the Django web framework (http://www.djangoproject.com/). It uses a SQLite relational database to store data. Among the features provided are profile and login, an image drawing tool, wiki-like pages of all entries and a search tool.  

We would like to emphasize here that there is no need to register or to log in to view the content of the database. However, the profile and login features have been provided for collaborators and ‘super users’ who are interested not only in viewing, but also editing the content of the database. Creating an account and loging into the database give the user access to the admin site of the database, but also uncovers the wiki-like pages of the entries. By entering the administration site it is possible to add new data, delete information, edit and correct mistakes. Editing information about proteins, genes, diseases and types of damage is also available via wiki-like pages, from the pages of particular database entries. Users can also add comments and new references to existing records.  

The image drawing tool (accessible via a ‘draw a picture’ link in the main menu) system has been developed to illustrate all steps of DNA repair pathways as protein–DNA complexes, in which proteins are displayed in the textbook-like format of ‘potato models’ (ellipsoids). However, it can be also used as a standalone tool (without any connection to REPAIRtoire) to create images of protein–protein or protein–DNA complexes. The drawing engine uses the SVG format provided by the W3C consortium, and enables exporting the image in the JPEG format. The SVG format enables resizing the images without the loss of the quality and makes it possible to modify them with external tools for vector graphics processing, e.g. Inkscape or others free or commercially available software.  

The REPAIRtoire database can be queried using a simple text search tool, available in the main menu. The tool returns a structured list of entries in the database that contain the query (e.g. ‘cancer’, ‘DNA polymerase’, ‘crosslink’, ‘adenine’, etc. or a name of the author). In future, we plan to introduce filtering and advanced search options (e.g. to enable sorting according to the relevance to the query).  

# DISCUSSION  

The topic of DNA repair is covered by many computational resources; however, thus far there has been no specialized database dedicated to DNA repair pathways. The repairGENES database (http://www.repairgenes.org/) collects information about genes encoding proteins involved in DNA repair and connects information taken from sequence and ontology databases. Repair-FunMap (24) used to provide information about the network of interactions between proteins involved in DNA repair and other proteins, but to our best knowledge it is no longer available. Information about DNA repair pathways and their components is available also in general-purpose pathway databases such as KEGG (25) or REACTOME (26). REPAIRtoire is dedicated to DNA repair and it contains more detailed and select information than the general-purpose pathway databases. An important component of REPAIRtoire that to our knowledge is not present in other databases is the dataset of DNA damage, connected to potential causes of each lesion as well as to effects if they are not removed. REPAIRtoire is also unique in that it provides reciprocal links between the damage (or its more general type) and the proteins that can detect and remove it. Our literature survey has also revealed a greater number of connections between particular DNA lesions and the respective proteins that can detect and remove it than can be found in general databases.  

In the development of REPAIRtoire, we used our experience from the work on the MODOMICS database of RNA modification pathways (27,28). We hope that this database will become comparably popular and useful for the community of researchers working on DNA repair, as MODOMICS has become in the RNA modification community. In the future, we plan to integrate these databases using a common data model and a joint interface, and to extend the database system to cover the entire metabolism of nucleic acids.

# Abstract  

Paired single-cell and spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data supplement each other, providing in-depth insights into biological processes and disease mechanisms. P evious SRT databases have limitations in curating sufficient single-cell and SRT pairs (SC–SP pairs) and providing real-time heuristic analysis, which hinder the effort to uncover potential biological insights. Here, we developed Pairpot (http://pairpot.bioxai.cn , a database tailored for paired single-cell and SRT data with real-time heuristic analysis. Pairpot curates 99 high-quality pairs including 1,425,656 spots from 299 datasets, and creates the association networks. It constructs the curated pairs by integrating multiple slices and establishing potential associations between single-cell and SRT data. On this basis, Pairpot adopts semi-supervised learning that enables real-time heuristic analysis or SC–SP pairs where Lasso-View efines he user-selected SRT domains within milliseconds, Pair-View nfers cell proportions of spots based on user-selected cell types in real-time and Layer-View displays SRT slices using a 3D hierarchical layout. Experiments demonstrated Pairpot’s efficiency in identifying heterogeneous domains and cell proportions.

# Introduction  

With the rapid development of single-cell technologies [e.g. single-cell RNA sequencing scRNA-seq)], more and more cellular expression patterns are characterized, which allows the construction of numerous cell atlases in the single-cell resolution (1 . These massive atlases reveal significant cell-tocell heterogeneity across diverse tissues and organ systems. The functions of tissues are closely related to the positional contexts in microenvironments; however, cells usually suffer from dissociation during the whole tissue suspension (2 . To effectively preserve the invaluable spatial contexts, spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) technologies are developed, making it promising to uncover the heterogeneous transcriptome landscapes (3 .  

SRT echnologies all nto wo categories: sequencing-based [i.e. $10\times$ Visium (4 , Slide-seq V2 (5  and Stereo-seq (6 ] and imaging-based [i.e. MERFISH (7 , STARmap (8  and NanoString COX (9 ] strategies, which often require the presence of single-cell data to detect spatial contexts in single-cell levels (10 . Sequencing-based technologies capture long-read transcripts in situ and then conduct next-generation sequencing in spot resolution (11 . They require precisely annotated singlecell data as references to infer the cell proportions of each spot (12 . Image-based technologies detect target sequences using fluorescent probes, which fetch hundreds of genes at most (10 . They also require well-annotated single-cell data for cell-type abel ransfer 13 . ntegrating single-cell and spatial transcriptomics as pairs can facilitate discoveries in fields such as neuroscience (14  and tumor micro-environments (15 . Specifically, these single-cell and spatial transcriptome data pairs SC–SP pairs) should exhibit high similarity n erms of species, tissues, developmental stages and diseases (12 .  

To achieve SC–SP pairs, more and more studies performed single-cell and SRT sequencing simultaneously on samples of the same conditions and further conducted integrative analysis (16 . Besides these studies, some SRT research used previously published single-cell data or atlases, which were generated under similar conditions with SRT data, to achieve SC–SP pairs for integrative analysis (17 . In addition, many SRT researches are still not supplemented with paired singlecell data. Previous SRT databases mainly focus on collecting spatial transcriptomics data [e.g. SpatialDB (18 , SOAR (19 , SODB (20 , STomicsDB (21  and Aquila (22 ] but ignore curating paired single-cell data. Researchers have to frequently access corresponding single-cell data from different data resources to match SC–SP pairs, which is time-consuming. It is promising o construct a database hat collects currently available single-cell and SRT data and creates valuable SC–SP pairs with cell-type annotations.  

Recently, some databases have considered paired singlecell and spatial transcriptomics resources [e.g. SPASCER (23 , ssREAD (24 , SORC (25  and CROST (26 ]. Existing databases are either limited to specific fields [e.g. cancer (25  and Alzheimer’s disease (24 ] or mainly focus on analysis within individual slices, ignoring potential associations across multiple slices of SRT data. Analysis within individual slices may pose challenges for capturing the global spatial distribution patterns that span across slices. These databases also ignore establishing potential associations between single-cell and SRT data, which may make it hard to discover cells and spots with similar biological processes and disease mechanisms. Further, these databases offer limited support for incorporating heuristic analysis according to user interaction patterns. They fail to dynamically personalize spatial segmentation or deconvolution according to user-selected spots (cells) in real-time, making it challenging for users to identify rare cell types and regional heterogeneity of SRT data. Suppose biologists would like to personalize the integrative analysis, such as modifying annotations in single-cell references according to their preferences. In that case, they would have to spend extra time and effort reorganizing inputs, running pipelines and fine-tuning parameters repeatedly.  

To deal with the challenges above, we developed Pairpot, a database with real-time lasso-based analysis tailored for paired single-cell and spatial transcriptomics. Pairpot currently curates 99 available single-cell and SRT data pairs from 299 studies, evaluates the quality of these SC–SP pairs, and establishes their association networks. Pairpot performs in-depth pre-analysis on the curated pairs, including clustering, cell-type annotation, marker detection, cell-proportion nference and cell/domain interaction. Pairpot provides LayerView to display multiple slices in a 3D hierarchical layout. In addition, Pairpot constructs the neighbor graphs based on integrated data to establish connections among multiple slices. Pairpot assigns signatures of different cell types from PanglaoDB (27  using UCell (28  to evaluate the relative gene expression in single-cell and SRT data. On this basis, Pairpot proposes real-time lasso-based heuristic analysis based on semi-supervised machine learning. In particular, Lasso-View refines the customized domains lassoed by users within milliseconds using the neighbor graphs from integrated data. Moreover, Pair-View infers cell proportions of spots using the cell types defined by users based on UCell signatures. Pairpot also generates code for these heuristic analysis that allows users to integrate these analysis with their existing pipelines. We leveraged Lasso-View to uncover similar domains across multiple slices using lassoed spots, and utilized Pair-View to precisely infer proportions of user-defined cell sub-types. These case studies demonstrated Pairpot’s efficiency in discovering heterogeneous domains and cell proportions. n summary, Pairpot provides valuable database resources and powerful heuristic analysis tools that empower researchers to streamline real-time single-cell and SRT integrative analysis.  

# Materials and methods  

# Data collection  

Spatial transcriptomics and single-cell datasets were acquired and downloaded from databases such as the National Center for Biotechnology nformation 29 , European Bioinformatics Institute 30 , China National Center or Bio-information 31 and $10\times$ Genomics (https://www.10xgenomics.com .  

Inspired by previous studies 12 , we designed strategies or collecting paired single-cell datasets that hinge on the nature of he SRT studies. nitially, f he SRT studies hemselves provide single-cell data, we would collect hem directly. f he SRT studies lack their own single-cell data but use previous singlecell datasets for integration analysis, we would collect these corresponding single-cell datasets instead. n the case that the SRT studies did not mention any single-cell datasets, we would search for paired single-cell datasets according to the consistency of features such as species, tissues and diseases among the SRT and single-cell studies. If there exist multiple singlecell studies with the same features, Pairpot chooses the singlecell data that gives annotation files by default. When there exist multiple studies that provide annotation files, Pairpot chooses the study containing the widest variety of cell types by default. Lastly, when all the above strategies fail, we would resort o he cells of corresponding issues rom ovarian singlecell atlases.  

We constructed association networks among different datasets using Neovis.js. For constructing he word clouds, we used the term frequency-inverse document frequency strategy based on TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn (version 1.0.2) to evaluate the word weight in the dataset summary and overall design.  

# Data curation Quality control and preprocessing  

Quality control was conducted on raw scRNA-seq and SRT data using Cell Ranger (version 7.2) and Space Ranger (version 3.0) $10\times$ Genomics) o remove ow-quality reads respectively. For BAM format files, we converted them to raw sequencing files using bamtofastq in CellRanger and then performed quality control. All datasets were manually converted to Anndata format after quality control. We used Scanpy (32 (version 1.9.1) as the standard downstream analysis pipeline. Genes expressing less than five cells were filtered out. Cells (spots) expressing ${>}200$ genes or showing a mitochondrial expression ratio above $5\%$ of he otal gene expression were also removed. Doublet cells n scRNA-seq data were dentified and removed using Scrublet (33  (version 1.1.0). We performed log-normalization, selected 2000 highly variable genes using sc.pp highly_variable_genes and performed principal component analysis (PCA) using sc.pp.pca(adata, $n_{-}c o m p s{=}50$ , svd_solv $e r=^{\cdot}a r$ pack’)  

# Data integration and neighbor graph construction  

To establish the associations among slices in SRT data, we integrated multiple samples presented in a dataset to correct batch effects using harmonypy (34  (version 0.0.9) based on 50 PCA components. Specifically for image-based data, we further integrated multiple image-based SRT samples with paired scRNA-seq data. For neighbor graph construction, assuming that the integrated dataset has $n$ cells, we constructed the knn-based connectivity graph $V(n^{*}n)$ using the function sc.pp.neighbors  In the connectivity graph, each node represents a cell, and each edge represents he distance between wo cells. We used a Gaussian kernel o generate he similarity matrix W where  

$$
\mathbb{W}_{i,j}=-e x p(-\alpha V_{i,j}^{2}).
$$  

Here, the hyper-parameter $\alpha$ is 0.5 by default. Next, we built the probability ransition matrix ${\mathrm{~P}},$ where $P_{i j}$ is he probability of label transition from cell i to cell j.  

$$
P_{i,j}=\frac{W_{i,j}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}{W_{i,k}}}.
$$  

The dimensional reduction was performed for visualization using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and $\mathrm{\Deltat}$ -distributed stochastic neighbor embedding based on he neighbor graphs. Afterwards, we used MENDER (35  o perform multi-scale cellular context representations of SRT data.  

# Clustering and cell annotation  

Pairpot segmented the spatial domains in multiple slices using MENDER (35  based on the multi-scale cellular context representations. For scRNA-seq data, Pairpot clusters he cells using the Leiden algorithm with the default resolution. Markers were detected using sc.tl.rank_genes_groups (adata, groupby $\prime=$ leiden’, method $\mathrel{\mathop:}=$ wilcoxon’)  

Pairpot uses different strategies to replicate annotations for single-cell data in the following scenarios. In the scenario where the original study provides a publicly available annotation file, Pairpot directly imports and verifies its integrity, maintaining a direct alignment with he source data. n he scenario where annotation files are not available, Pairpot refers to the markers and cell names provided by original studies and replicates annotations manually. In the replicating process, existing publications may provide detailed annotations for the clusters relevant to their research topics, while other clusters are loosely annotated (36 . The annotations of the clusters irrelevant to the original research topics may also be valuable for other researchers. We annotate these clusters by matching their marker genes with existing canonical markers to improve annotation accuracy. n the scenario where studies lack cell-type names or markers, we search for the potential cell types according to the organs and species from existing cell marker databases [e.g. PanglaoDB (27  and CellMarker 2.0 (37 ], and then perform manual annotation as same as the scenario above.  

# UCell assignment  

Evaluating signature scores in both single-cell and SRT data helps elucidate cell-type proportions and unctions n cells and spots, and therefore establish potential associations between single-cell and SRT data. Pairpot uses UCell 28  o assign signature scores and evaluate cell types for the datasets lacking original annotations. Since UCell scores only depend on relative gene expression, they are also fundamental parameters for Pair-View to perform real-time cell proportion inference in SRT data.  

For an SC–SP pair, we first found the potential cell types $\mathcal{C}=\{c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{k}\}$ and their corresponding gene signatures $\boldsymbol{S}=\{S_{1},S_{2},...,S_{k}\}$ from PanglaoDB (27  based on the species and tissues. Then we evaluated the UCell scores (28  of the cell-type gene signatures in $s$ . Assuming that a dataset has m genes after pre-processing, he gene expression of a cell or spot $x_{i}$ is $G_{i}=\{g_{i1},g_{i2},...,g_{i m}\},$ Assuming a cell-type gene signature set has $n$ genes $S=\{s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{n}\},S\in G_{i}$ and he corresponding gene rank score is $r_{i1},r_{i2},...,r_{i n}$ he UCell score of $x_{i}$ is  

$$
U C e l l(x_{i},S)=1-\frac{U}{U_{\mathrm{{max}}}},
$$  

where  

$$
U=\sum_{j=1}^{k}r_{i j}^{\prime}-R_{\mathrm{min}}
$$  

$$
U_{\mathrm{max}}=R_{\mathrm{max}}-R_{\mathrm{min}}.
$$  

Here, U is the Mann–Whitney U statistic (bounded by 0 and $U_{\mathrm{max}}\mathrm{;}$ , and maxRank is a hyperparameter (default to 1500), which sets imitations o he rank of he op genes. Rank score $R_{i j}$ larger than maxRank would be set to maxRank $R_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $R_{\mathrm{min}}$ are the max and min rank sum scores, respectively.  

$$
\begin{array}{r}{r_{i j}^{\prime}=\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{r_{i j},\quad}&{r_{i j}<m a x R a n k}\\ {m a x R a n k,r_{i j}\geq m a x R a n k}\end{array}\right.}\end{array}
$$  

$$
R_{\mathrm{max}}=n*m a x R a n k
$$  

$$
R_{\mathrm{min}}={\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}
$$  

# Deconvolution  

Deconvolution was performed using Cell2Location (12  (version 0.1.3), RCTD (38  (version 2.0.0), CARD (39  (version 1.0), SpaTalk (40  (version 1.0), Seurat (41  (version 5.1.0) and CellTrek (42  for integrative analysis to infer the cell proportions of each spot using pre-defined cell type annotation results.  

# Cell communication  

We employed CellphoneDB (43  (version 5.0), CellChat (44  (version 1.5.0), TALK (https://github.com/Coolgenome/ iTALK)  COMMOT (45  (version 0.0.3) and SpaTalk (40) (version 1.0) for cell interaction inference leveraging the clustering and cell-type annotation results, which were used o analyze communication patterns and mechanisms between issue regions and neighboring cell types.  

# Real-time heuristic analysis  

Real-time heuristic analysis refers to the rapid (usually within milliseconds) processing of analytical tasks leveraging userprovided prompts, enabling timely responses. In Pairpot, we developed two real-time heuristic analysis modules: LassoView, which refines user-selected spatial domains or cells; and Pair-View, which infers cell proportions of spots using the user-defined cell types.  

Inspired by the label propagation algorithm (46 , LassoView aims to propagate the prior labels according to the connectivity among cells. During data curation, Pairpot evaluates similarity using the Gaussian kernel function and generates the probability transition matrix $(P)$ for each dataset according to formula (2). Each element $P_{i j}$ in $P$ represents the probability of transferring from the cell (spot) $i$ to $j$ During online analysis, based on annotations provided by Pairpot, users can generate customized annotations by selecting new cell types using lasso tools. Lasso-View generates the prior labels by masking $90\%$ of he cells annotated by Pairpot and appends he cells selected by users. Assuming hat he prior abels have m candidates $\{l_{1},l_{2},...,l_{m}\}$ , Lasso-View generates the label probability matrix $Y_{n^{*}m}$ whose element $Y_{i j}$ represents the probability of classifying cell (spot) $i$ as label $l_{j}$ $0\leq Y_{i j}\leq1$ . $Y_{n^{*}m}$ is decomposed into $Y L_{k^{*}m}$ containing labeled cells, and $Y U_{(n-k)^{*}m}$ containing unlabelled ones, $n$ denotes the number of cells and $k$ denotes the number of labeled ones. Lasso-View initializes the label probability matrix $Y_{0}$ as follows:  

$$
Y_{0}={\bigg[}Y L_{0}{\bigg]},Y L_{0i j}={\bigg\{}1,}\quad{\mathrm{if~}}\mathrm{label}(i)=l_{j}\ ,Y U_{0i j}={\frac{1}{m}}.
$$  

Here, $1\leq i\leq k$ in $Y L_{0},k+1\leq i\leq n$ in $Y U_{0}$ $1\leq j\leq m$ n $Y L_{0}$ each of its elements $Y L_{0i j}$ is set to 1 f the label of cell $i$ s $l_{j}$ n $Y U_{0}$ all nitial values are set o $1/m$ ndicating that each cell (spot) has an equal probability of being classified as any label candidate. During the iteration, Lasso-View calculates a new label proportion matrix $Y_{t}$ by multiplying the probability transition matrix $P$ with $Y_{t-1}$ and doing normalization subsequently. In epoch $t$  

$$
\begin{array}{c}{Y_{t}=[Y L_{t},Y U_{t}]^{T}}\\ {Y L_{t}=Y L_{0},}\\ {Y U_{t}=n o r m a l i z e(Y U_{t}^{\prime}),}\\ {{[Y L_{t}^{\prime},Y U_{t}^{\prime}]^{T}=P\times Y_{t-1}.}}\end{array}
$$  

Here, the normalize function denotes that each element in $\mathbf{\nabla}_{Y U_{t}},$ is divided by the sum of all the elements in its row. After each iteration, Lasso-View evaluates the L1-norm of the subtraction between $Y_{t}$ and $Y_{t-1}$ Based on our experimental evaluations Supplementary Figure S1 , we determined hat the ermination point most suitable or Lasso-View s at either 1000 epochs or upon reaching a convergence at  

$$
\frac{|Y_{t}-Y_{t-1}|}{n}<10^{-5}.
$$  

After termination, or each cell (spot) $i,$ Lasso-View assigns to it the label with the highest probability in $Y_{i:}$  

$$
l a b e l(i)=a r g m a x(\left[Y_{i1},Y_{i2}\ldots,Y_{i j}\right]),1\le j\le m.
$$  

Indeed, a few of the cells selected by users may be dissimilar from the major selected cells. After the Lasso-View process, we rectify the label of each lassoed cell with the most frequent label among its $\mathbf{k}$ -nearest cells. Ultimately, the result will be displayed in the right chart of Lasso-View.  

Pair-View aims to infer cell proportions of spots using the user-selected cells from single-cell data in real time. Inspired by SPOTlight (47 , Pair-View performs non-negative linear square regression NNLS) using UCell scores rom userdefined cell types and spots in SRT data. During online analysis, users select cells in the single-cell data, while Paire-View assigns the user-selected cell type $u$ to these cells. Pair-View then generates he prior abels by appending he cell ype $u$ and other previously annotated cell ypes. Assuming hat SRT data has $n$ spots, single-cell data have $m$ cell types (including the user-selected cell type) and their pre-built UCell scores have $k$ gene signature sets. Pair-View constructs a non-negative inear regression model to infer cell proportions in spatial transcriptomics using the user-selected cells in scRNA-seq data.  

$$
Y_{s p}\sim\mathrm{W}*X_{s c}
$$  

Here, $Y_{s p}$ is the $n\times k$ UCell scores matrix of all spots in SRT data, $X_{s c}$ is the $m\times k$ mean UCell scores of all cell types in single-cell data. Each UCell score is defined by formula (3). W is the $n\times m$ coefficient matrix, whose element $\$\mathrm{w}\S_{i j}$ denotes the weight of cell type $j$ in spot $i.$ The coefficient matrix $W$ is inferred by LinearRegression(positive True) in scikit-learn (version 1.3.2), Pair-View returns the weight of user-selected cell-type $u$ in all spots as the cell proportions in SRT data.  

$$
P r o p(u)=[w_{1u},w_{2u},...,w_{n u}]
$$  

# Database construction  

The front-end frameworks were constructed with React.js (version 18.1.2) and ant-design (version 5.19.3). The realtime analysis modules were constructed with Echarts (version 5.4.3). The backend was built using Flask (version 3.1.0) and Python (version 3.10.12). Pairpot used SQLite3 (version 9.6) to store the metadata of publications and datasets. Neo4j (version 5.22.0) was used to store the relationships among datasets. Nginx v1.22.0) was used as he reverse proxy server. Currently, Pairpot has been ested successfully n he ollowing browsers: Google Chrome (v114.0), Safari (v17.5) and Firefox (v114.0).

# Database contents and usage  

# Overview of Pairpot  

Pairpot is a database tailored for paired single-cell and spatial transcriptomics data, providing data deployment, nteractive data exploration and lasso-based real-time analysis (Figure 1 . Pairpot collected 299 SRT datasets from 251 studies and generated 99 SC–SP pairs across 17 species and 25 spatial ranscriptomics echnologies, ncluding 1,180,181 cells and 1,425,656 spots Figure 1A). Pairpot provides association networks to establish connections among different single-cell and SRT studies, and wordclouds to excavate the focal points of the current available datasets in the research community. Pairpot also introduces a ‘Pair Score’ to evaluate the quality of each SC–SP pair.  

Pairpot establishes the associations among SRT slices in a study by constructing neighbor graphs of multiple slices in multi-scales. The neighbor graphs enable users to heuristically explore and identify similar cells (spots) in other samples after selecting cells in one sample. Pairpot also provides cell-type annotations of single-cell data and their cell proportions in SRT data. Moreover, Pairpot establishes the associations among single-cell and SRT data by evaluating their UCell scores, which enables users to infer the proportions of their customized cell types in spots of SRT data (Figure 1B). Each SRT dataset in Pairpot contains a gene expression matrix and the spatial coordinates for each spot. Each singlecell dataset contains cells with precise cell-type annotations, which are randomly downsampled to 3000 in order to accelerate the web-page loading while maintaining enough biological information. Both single-cell and SRT datasets are curated into a unified data format based on AnnData (48 . On this basis, Pairpot provides real-time analysis ncluding LayerV ew, Lasso-V ew and Pair-View that supports for incorporating heuristic analysis according o user nteraction patterns (Figure 1C).  

Pairpot contains five modules: the data search and browse module, the Lasso-View module, the Layer-View module, the Pair-View module and he analysis results exploration module (Figure 2 . Users can access each module using the navigation bar on the top of the Pairpot home page.  

# Data search and browse  

Pairpot enables efficient navigation through the extensive collection of datasets, which provides convenient access to metainformation, and literature resources (Figure 2A). Users can search for datasets by any words of interest, or apply filters by clicking preset keywords in species, tissues, technologies and diseases. Afterwards, hey can take an overview of statistics and word clouds about the filtered results by browsing through an extensive ist or association networks of all singlecell and SRT datasets. n the extensive list, each item contains a title, summary and a series of action buttons. By clicking ‘Visualization’, users can access the paired dataset, the static analysis results and the lasso-based real-time analysis module. By clicking ‘Descriptions’, users can access detailed metainformation and links to original datasets in each item. In the association networks, each node denotes a dataset and its color denotes the dataset’s species. Nodes with self-loops in the network represent datasets that contain SC–SP pairs. Paired single-cell and SRT datasets are linked by undirected edges. Users can click the nodes to explore detailed information and access he analysis modules. n brief, Pairpot provides visual insights into dataset relationships and characteristics.  

# Lasso-view  

Lasso-View is a heuristic analysis that discovers extra omitted cells (spots) similar to the lassoed ones in both single-cell and SRT datasets based on semi-supervised machine learning (Figure 2B). Users select cells (spots) of interest as a cluster (domain), then Lasso-View discovers unselected cells similar to those in the user-defined cluster and removes the cells mistakenly selected into the cluster (Figure 3 . During data curation, the probability transition matrix of each dataset was generated by Pairpot in advance (Figure 3A). During online analysis, users can generate customized annotations by adding new cell ypes using asso ools. Then, Lasso-View masks $90\%$ of cell (spot) labels, appends the user-selected labels and initializes the initial label probability matrix (Figure 3B) and then enters iterations (Figure 3C). After the termination of iterations, Lasso-View highlights cells similar to the new cell type with rectification (Figure 3D). Combined with neighbor graphs constructed with integrated datasets, Lasso-View can further discover similar spatial domains across multiple slices based on user-selected domains in a slice. Users can click the lasso ools at TopRight and hen select heir cells of nterest n the left chart. Lasso-View provides various select modes and tools or users o zoom, draw and erase heir customized cells. Lasso-View also offers predefined annotations of spatial domains and cell annotations, which serve as a reference guide for users o select cells spots) of heir nterests. After renaming the selected cells, users can click ‘Refine’ to generate refined annotations by calling he API of Lasso-View n he server. The API of Lasso-View s optimized by $\mathrm{C}{+}{+}$ , ensuring efficient processing of single-cell and SRT datasets within a millisecondlevel response time. The refined annotations can be confirmed and downloaded through their corresponding buttons, facilitating the sharing of refined results among collaborators.  

# Layer-view  

Inspired by 3D Landscape in De-spot (49 , Pairpot develops Layer-View to dynamically display gene expressions and annotations of multiple slices in 3D hierarchical layouts (Figure 2C). Leveraging he ntegrated neighbor graphs, he spatial domains are segmented across multiple slices using MENDER (35 . Users can explore multiple slices of a study in the left chart, or focus on a single slice in the right chart. In the 3D layout, the $\mathbf{x}$ -axis and y-axis denote the spatial coordinates of the slices, while the z-axis represents different batches of these slices. Users can rotate the axis to switch perspectives, click ‘Inverse’ to hide all annotations, and highlight specific domains by clicking their legends.  

# Pair-view  

Pair-View is another heuristic analysis that aids users in quickly inferring cell proportions of spots using their customized cells from single-cell data in real-time (Figure 2D). The interface of Pair-View allows users to view SRT data (right) and paired single-cell data (left) simultaneously. Users can use asso ools o select cells of heir nterests n he singlecell chart, similar to Lasso-View. They can also use options in ‘scConfigs’ to select customized cell types under different annotations and embeddings. After selecting customized cell types, users can click the ‘Deconv’ buttons to call the PairView API. The Pair-View API performs NNLS online based on the pre-analyzed UCell scores, which uses the Mann–Whitney U statistic o evaluate he related gene expression n single-cell and SRT data (see the ‘Materials and methods’ section). The inferred cell proportions would be subsequently displayed in the SRT chart. Users can further explore cell proportions in different batches through the options in ‘spConfigs’.  

# Analysis results exploration  

Pairpot also provides diverse pre-analysis results for user exploration (Figure 2E). Users can click a cell type in the left chart of Pair-View and then its proportions will be displayed in the right chart accordingly. Users can access spatial markers of domains through a marker heatmap, where domains are hierarchically clustered. When hovering over the scatters in he Marker Table, a ooltip will pop up with heir cell ypes, marker names, average expressions and ractions. When clicking the ‘Rotation’ button, the marker table will exchange the $\mathbf{x}\cdot$ -axis and y-axis and provide a scalable slider to navigate through areas of interest. Users can browse interaction networks and ligand-receptor pairs for both single-cell and SRT data. For spatial domain interactions of SRT data, users can see the spatial locations of clusters by clicking nodes in the spatial domain interaction networks. For cell interactions of single-cell data, users can see the locations of cells in UMAP embeddings alongside. When hovering over a clustering node, the ooltip will pop up with main cell ypes, nteraction counts and highly variable genes. In addition, users can select the provided legends to re-render the interaction networks. For ligand-receptor pair heatmaps, users can select he results generated by different interaction inference methods as preferences.  

# Case study  

We explored the embryonic mouse brain spatial transcriptomics data (STDS0000235), which contains four slices with 4597 spots and 17 different domains (17 . Its corresponding single-cell data (SCDS0000001) are from dorsal and ventral E13.5 embryonic brains of a previous published dataset (50 , which are further annotated to 11 cell types including astrocytes, neurons, neuroblasts, pyramidal cells, platelets and erythroid cells (Figure 4 .

We conducted case studies to evaluate the capability of Lasso-View o discover biological nsights. n Lasso-View case 1, we selected spots n a ateral ganglionic eminence LGE) domain of slice Control 02 (Figure 4A, eft). After calling LassoView API, the refined domains were highlighted not only in slice Control 02 but also in LGE domains of other slices (Figure 4A, right). In addition, spots mistakenly selected in the cortex regions were removed. In Lasso-View case 2, we selected part of the interneuron cells in the single-cell chart, and the refined cells covered the interneurons after calling LassoView API (Figure 4B). The results demonstrated that LassoView can discover similar domains across different slices and remove unrelated spots.  

To evaluate the accuracy and response speed of LassoView, we randomly select cells and call the Lasso-View API $10\ 000$ times to simulate the user’s behavior. As shown in Figure 4C, the average processing time of Lasso-View API is ${<}200$ milliseconds or single-cell data and about 500 milliseconds for SRT data. We masked $90\%$ of labels, and randomly replaced the remained $10\%$ of labels with errors as pseudo user-selected labels for Lasso-View. We used these pseudolabels to predict the labels of masked cells and evaluate ARI for each cell type. The average ARI for single-cell data was over 0.8 in the non-error situation and remained above 0.7 even when the error rate was up to 0.6 (Figure 4D). For spatial transcriptome data, the average ARI reached 0.85 in the non-error situation and remained above 0.7 when the error rate was up to 0.65 (Figure 4E). Additionally, we tested the capability of rectification options. Lasso-View with rectification maintained significantly better ARI performance across different error rates (Figure 4D and E). The results above revealed that Lasso-View can accurately discover cells similar to user-selected ones and sensitively rectify errors in the user selection within milliseconds.  

We also applied real cases to evaluate the capability of Pair-View n nferring cell proportions using user-selected cells from single-cell data. Neuroblast2 cells were originally detected in the dorsal and ventral embryonic brain (Figure 4F). To detect the proportions of neuroblast2 more precisely, we manually dichotomized neuroblast2 into subtype 1 and subtype 2 using lasso tools. n particular, subtype1 contains more cells rom he dorsal batch, while subtype2 contains more cells from the ventral batch. After calling Pair-View API, we found that subtype 1 was correctly detected in the cortex of the dorsal embryonic brain, corresponding o he expression of TBR1 (Figure 4G). n contrast, subtype 2 was detected n he LGE region of the ventral brain, associated with GAD2 (Figure 4H). The locations of both subtype 1 and subtype 2 remain consistent across the four slices. The results demonstrated that Pair-View can perform precise cell proportion nference online and significantly improve the efficiency of exploring paired datasets.  

# Conclusions and future developments  

We presented Pairpot, a database with real-time lasso-based analysis tailored for single-cell and SRT pairs. The database aims to ease the process of searching SC–SP pairs and facilitate the applications of paired single-cell and SRT data within the research community. Pairpot collects available SC–SP pairs and constructs the network associations among them. Pairpot evaluates he quality of SC–SP pairs, ntegrates different slices, establishes potential associations between single-cell and SRT data, and offers advanced real-time heuristic analysis modules to significantly promote understanding of biological processes and disease mechanisms. In particular, Lasso-View refines he user-selected cells by discovering unselected cells similar to those in the user-defined cluster and removing the mistakenly selected cells. Lasso-View s optimized by $\mathrm{C}{+}{+}$ and can respond within milliseconds. Pair-View can infer cell proportions of spots using he user-selected cells rom single-cell data. Both Lasso-View and Pair-View achieve real-time in online scenarios, considerably reducing the extra work required by biologists in segmentation and deconvolution, hereby significantly improving the efficiency of personalized analysis. Pairpot is valuable to biologists not only because it offers easy-toaccess paired datasets but also because its lasso-based modules provide a new perspective for developing efficient online computational platforms based on pre-analyzed information and user behavior. Pairpot s also useful or researchers o seek potential biological insights because it provides both overall observations or multiple slices n a 3D ayout and precise realtime lass-based analysis for cells or domains of user’s interest.  

Pairpot’s intuitive interface and heuristic analysis modules empower users to tailor their workflows according to their specific needs. For researchers who prefer to download the data and conduct analyses offline, Pairpot generates code for online heuristic analysis and alternative bioinformatics tools that allow users to replicate the analysis results offline. If researchers would like to analyze their own paired single-cell and SRT data, they can integrate the interfaces provided by Pairpot nto heir pipelines, ncluding preprocessing, data ntegration, neighbor graph construction and UCell scores evaluation. For researchers without programming capabilities, Pairpot provides valuable resources and powerful tools online to streamline the SRT integrative analysis and enhance the understanding of biological processes and disease mechanisms.  

We will continue o update Pairpot by collecting newly published SRT data with annotations and matching them with paired single-cell data. In addition, we plan to conduct SC– SP pairs by matching an SRT dataset with multiple single-cell datasets simultaneously. Since single-cell and spatial ranscriptomics are both fast-evolving fields, we plan to continuously provide results generated by newly developed alternative ools and develop more downstream analysis modules to facilitate biomedical research.

# ABSTRACT  

# INTRODUCTION  

The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system, or the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), is known for its extreme polymorphic nature and high heterogeneity. Taking advantage of whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing data, we developed PG .MHC to provide a platform to explore the diversity of the MHC in Asia as well as in global populations. PG .MHC currently archives high-resolution HLA alleles of 53 254 samples representing 190 populations spanning 66 countries. PG .MHC provides: (i) high-quality allele frequencies for eight classical HLA loci (HLA-A, -B, -C, - DQA1, -DQB1, -DRB1, -DPA1 and -DPB1); (ii) visualization of population prevalence of HLA alleles on global, regional, and country-wide levels; (iii) haplotype structure of 134 populations; (iv) two online analysis tools including ‘HLA imputation’ for inferring HLA alleles from SNP genotyping data and ‘HLA association’ to perform case/control studies for HLA-related phenotypes and (v) East Asian–specific reference panels for HLA imputation. Equipped with high-quality frequency data and user-friendly computer tools, we expect that the PG .MHC database can advance the understanding and facilitate applications of MHC genomic diversity in both evolutionary and medical studies. The PG .MHC database is freely accessible via https://pog.fudan.edu.cn/ pggmhc or https://www.pggmhc.org/pggmhc.  

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, located at chromosome position 6p21 of the human genome, harbors multiple class I and class II human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, which are co-dominantly expressed to present intracellular and extracellular antigens, respectively. The HLA genes are associated with various autoimmune diseases (1,2), infectious diseases (3), cancers (4) and psychiatric diseases (5). HLA genes also play a vital role in transplantation, for certain encoded HLA molecules can function as antigens which can incite immune response and lead to rejection in transplantation (6). The HLA genes are highly polymorphic, and there are currently 34 422 identified alleles according to the HLA sequence database IPDIMGT/HLA (Release 3.49 July 2022) (7), allowing finetuning of the immune system. The HLA genes display a high degree of diversity among populations and geographic regions. The diversity of HLA alleles can explain the genetic difference in some diseases among populations. For example, previous studies have shown that the HLA- $\mathbf{B}^{*}27$ carrier rate correlates with the population prevalence of ankylosing spondylitis, a type of arthritis of the human spine (8). Moreover, the disease-associated HLA alleles can vary among populations of different ancestry; for instance, pemphigus vulgaris is associated with HLA-DRB1 $^{*}04{:}02$ in Ashkenazi Jews, while in non-Jewish patients with European or Asian ethnic origins, the disease is associated with HLA-DRB $1^{*}14;01/04$ and HL $\mathrm{\Omega_{\lambda^{-}D Q B l^{*}05:03}}$ (9). HLA haplotype denotes a certain combination of HLA alleles on a chromosome, which is very important in matching unrelated donors and recipients in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). A study of German donors used the observed regional differences in HLA-A, -B and -DR alleles and haplotype frequencies to optimize HSCT donor recruitment strategies (10). Therefore, it is essential to investigate the diversity of HLA genes and dissect their haplotype structures within and between populations.  

To enable researchers to estimate the allele frequencies of HLA genes and other immune-related genes among populations, the allele frequency net database (AFND) has been constructed to serve as a repository for allele frequency data (11). In the AFND’s latest update, a gold-standard dataset classification criterion was introduced, including allele frequencies summing up to $1[\pm1.5\%]$ , sample size larger than 50, and 2-field resolution HLA allele. However, there is a lack of unified integration and HLA typing process in the AFND database, which can affect the comparability of allele frequencies between different datasets. Moreover, a limited number of loci have been genotyped in most AFND datasets. For instance, there are fewer than 10 datasets that have seven loci genotyped among golden datasets (12). In addition, to the best of our knowledge, there are no computer tools available in AFND or any other MHC databases for functional analysis of the MHC region.  

To address these issues, we developed a database towards understanding the Population Genomics and Genetics (PGG) of MHC, namely PGG.MHC, to explore the diversity of the MHC region in global populations. Eight classical HLA loci (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DQA1, -DQB1, -DRB1, -DPA1 and -DPB1) were genotyped for each sample. By the definition of AFND, 65 datasets in PGG.MHC can be categorized as golden datasets, providing users with highquality frequency data. For HLA alleles, we offer convenient queries of HLA allele frequencies and visualization of allele frequencies at global, regional, and country-wide levels. For HLA haplotypes, we offer haplotype frequency estimation and haplotype structure visualization of 134 populations.  

In addition, we also implemented two computer tools with online interfaces, namely, HLA imputation and HLA association. The HLA imputation analysis tool imputes HLA genotypes for low-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping data using three public reference panels, i.e. 1000G REF, Pan-Asian panel, and Korean panel, as well as two newly constructed East Asian–specific reference panels, i.e. HuaBiao REF and PGG REF. The HLA association analysis tool was developed for phenotype associations based on HLA genotypes with a case/control design, where users can customize control data in the PGG.MHC database.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Data collection  

PGG.MHC currently archives 2181 HLA alleles of 53 254 samples representing 190 global populations spanning 66 countries, of which 6054 are whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, 5002 are whole-exome sequencing (WES) data, and 42 198 are high-density genome-wide genotyping data. The data were collected from the 1000 Genomes Project (KGP) (13), the Human Genome Diversity Project (14), and the Simons Genomic Diversity Project (15), as well as from the HuaBiao project (16), which provides samples from a variety of regional Han Chinese populations, and the PGG project (17,18), which covers samples from diverse populations in East Asia. Taken together, data from the HuaBiao project and the PGG project constitute most of the $P G G.{\bar{\mathrm{MHC}}}$ data source $(>50\ 000)$ , which captures the intricate regional genetic diversity in East Asian ethnic groups. Detailed information about data sources of PGG.MHC is provided in Supplementary Table S1.  

# HLA typing  

We performed HLA typing for three class I HLA genes (HLA-A, -B and -C) and five class II HLA genes (HLADRB1, -DQA1, -DQB1, -DPA1 and -DPB1). These genes were chosen for their important roles in antigen presentation and the fact that they are highly polymorphic (19). We applied corresponding HLA typing techniques for WGS, WES and genotyping data to determine the HLA alleles for each sample. In addition, for WES and WGS samples with high sequencing coverage, we obtained G-group resolution and 3-field resolution HLA alleles when applicable. Details about HLA nomenclature can be found in Figure 1. The complete workflow of HLA typing and genotype integration is described below:  

Direct typing for WGS and WES data. We performed HLA typing using various methods. For WGS data, we adopted kourami (20), HLA\*LA (21), HLA-HD (22) and OptiType (23) to perform HLA typing. OptiType could only provide HLA alleles at the 2-field resolution, while $\mathrm{HLA^{*}L A}$ and kourami could provide HLA alleles at the G-group resolution. For uniformity of HLA typing resolution, we mapped G-group resolution alleles to 2-field alleles based on each G-group allele’s nomenclature. For WES data, we performed typing using HLA-HD, OptiType, and POLYSOLVER (24) on class I genes and HLA-HD, PHLAT (25), and HLA-Genotyper (https:// pypi.org/project/hla-genotyper) on class II genes. Next, we integrated the typing results based on different methods for each HLA gene by designating the one with the highest frequency of occurrence as the final HLA genotype. In addition, we used $\mathrm{HLA^{*}L A}$ to perform 3-field HLA typing for WGS data and POLYSOLVER for WES data.  

Imputation-based HLA typing for genotyping data. Unlike WGS and WES data on which HLA typing can be directly carried out, genotyping data need to be imputed with sufficient SNPs to perform HLA typing. Hence, we adopted HLA-TAPAS (26) for imputation-based HLA typing of genotyping data. In particular, we first preprocessed the data by extracting SNPs of the HLA region using BCFtools (27) and converting the genome coordinates to GRCh38 using CrossMap (28). Second, we annotated the SNPs with dbSNP version 151 (29) and filtered out variants with missing call rates exceeding 0.1 or minor allele frequency below 0.001. Finally, we performed HLA imputation using HLATAPAS and summarized the 2-field HLA typing results.

Figure 1. A schematic diagram for HLA nomenclature.  

We verified the accuracy of our HLA typing workflow using samples from the KGP. WGS, WES, and genotyping data were acquired for these samples. Benchmark HLA types were obtained from (30). We demonstrated the HLA typing results for different data types and the benchmark HLA types in Supplementary Table S2. It turned out that the overall typing accuracy for WGS/WES/genotyping data are $100\%$ , $100\%$ , $100\%$ at the 1-field resolution, and $98.75\%$ , $92.5\%$ , $98.75\%$ at the 2-field resolution, respectively.  

# Haplotype structure building  

We merged samples of the same population from different data sources to build a haplotype structure. For each population with a sample size larger than 20, haplotype frequencies were estimated between adjacent loci and based on eight HLA loci’s 2-field resolution HLA alleles, using an expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm implemented in Hapl-o-Mat (31).  

# Database implementation  

We used HTTPS protocol to process, deliver, and render web resources and to ensure the secure transmission of private user data. The functionality of $P G G.{\mathrm{MHC}}$ has been tested in mainstream web browsers, including Chrome, Safari, IE, Opera and Firefox. We adopted a state-of-theart architecture (Supplementary Figure S1) to curate data storage and database management. For front-end development, we built the web user interfaces using a progressive JavaScript framework called Vue.js (https://vuejs.org), and data visualization was powered by echarts.js (https:// echarts.apache.org). For back-end development, the HTTP web server was created using Node.js (https://nodejs.org), a JavaScript runtime environment. For data storage, the structured data were stored in MySQL (https://www.mysql. com), and the unstructured document data, such as haplotype structures, were stored in MongoDB (https://www. mongodb.com). We used Nginx (https://nginx.org) as the reverse proxy server.  

# DATABASE CONTENT  

# Overview  

The database has three major functional modules. First, it has easy-to-use interfaces for querying allele frequency and affiliated populations (Figure 2). We also integrated external links to PGG.Population (32) database, containing detailed population genetic structure, links to AFND databases, containing the allele reports, and links to IPGIMGT/HLA database, containing the sequences of HLA alleles. Second, there is an interactive visualization of allele population prevalence and haplotype structure (Figure 3). The query interfaces and the visualization functions combined can illuminate the genetic structure of populations. Third, there are online analysis functions for genotype imputation and phenotype association (Figure 3). HLA imputation can infer HLA types for low-density SNP genotyping data uploaded by users using five reference panels compiled in our server. Considering the potential bias resulting from the heterogeneity in genetic background between case and control samples when performing association studies, we implemented an online interface for HLA associations where users can choose $P G G.{\mathrm{MHC}}$ populations that share a similar genetic background as their own controls.  

# Database query  

HLA allele frequency query. PGG.MHC provides powerful query interfaces for searching and browsing HLA allele frequencies by offering an intuitive search box on the home page (Figure 2A) and an extensive query interface on the HLA alleles page (Figure 2B). In the search box on the home page, users can build their queries by providing allele names or populations to search for $P G G.{\mathrm{MHC}}$ allele frequency entries. A click on the search button redirects the web page to the HLA alleles page, demonstrating the matched entries, where users can compare the differences in population frequencies of a specific allele or investigate the variety of HLA alleles in populations of interest. Users can click on the allele name to access the web page for allele details. In the sidebar on the HLA alleles page, users can fine-tune their query by four groups of filter options: (i) designating HLA loci, allele resolution, or allele range; (ii) selecting geographic locations or ethnic groups; (iii) limiting the source and type of data; and (iv) restricting the range of allele frequencies. Moreover, this interface allows users to sort query results by allele, population, frequency, and sample size by clicking the triangles on the right, and it enables users to export the desired entries as an Excel file.

Figure 2. Interfaces for data query in $P G G.{\mathrm{MHC}}$ . (A) The query interface on the Home page. (B) Filter options and an example of query results. (C) The population query interface on the Population List page.  

Population query. For users who are interested in HLA alleles of particular populations, we also offer a population query interface on a web page with the population list (Figure 2C), where they can select a region and a country (the web UI will show a complete list of countries when the mouse hovers on country items), or enter a keyword to query populations, and sort populations by different criteria. The population list below displays the population profile cards according to the query. Clicking on the card body redirects the web page to the corresponding population details page.  

# Population prevalence visualization of HLA alleles  

A key point in studying the polymorphisms of HLA alleles in populations is investigating the differences in allele frequencies among populations. PGG.MHC offers population prevalence visualization interfaces of HLA alleles at global, country-wide (China), and regional levels. At global and country-wide levels, we depict population prevalence using a scatter plot on a map, where each scatter denotes a set of samples from the same ethnic group and the same data source, with its color mapping the allele frequency and size mapping the sample size, facilitating users to develop an intuitive sense about population prevalence. At the regional level, we used box plots to summarize allele frequency variation in different geographical regions.  

To illustrate the potential application of population prevalence visualization in genetic and clinical studies, we picked the allele H $_{\mathrm{LA-DPAl^{*}01:03}}$ as a showcase and attached the screenshots of its population prevalence visualizations in Figure 3. This allele was previously reported in a genetic study to be associated with an inflammatory rheumatic disease called ankylosing spondylitis (AS) ( $P=$ 0.027) (2). In the global population prevalence map, we can see a pattern of allele frequency distribution, in which the allele is more common in Caucasian populations like European and American populations but less common in Japanese and African populations. This pattern fits the observations of previous genetic studies of AS (8), suggesting that the population prevalence visualization has potential value for genetic diversity studies of diseases.  

We are aware that the AFND database also visualizes the allele frequency by scatter plot on a global map. However, we improved and expanded the visualization in the following aspects: (i) for the functionality of the interface, we implemented a frequency bar in global and China maps with which users can toggle the upper and lower bounds to selectively display datasets limited to a specific frequency range; (ii) for a different perspective of allele frequency data, we not only offer population prevalence visualization of global and regional perspectives but also zoom-in to the most populous country in the world to depict the HLA allele frequencies in China and (iii) for the manner of display, unlike in AFND, where the allele frequencies in different regions are displayed in separate bar plots, we display the regional frequencies in a single box plot so that users can compare the frequency difference between regions and evaluate the variety of frequencies in a single region.

Figure 3. Sitemap of $P G G.{\mathrm{MHC}}$ . The database consists of three modules: (i) visualization of allele frequencies at global, country-wide, and regional levels; (ii) estimation of haplotype frequency and visualization of population haplotype structure; (iii) HLA imputation and HLA association online analysis tools.  

# HLA haplotype structures  

We estimated haplotype frequencies based on eight HLA loci at the 2-field resolution and displayed the results in the Sankey diagram and table views. The Sankey diagram view offers an intuitive understanding of the population haplotype structure, where we highlight the top three most frequent HLA haplotypes. Users can export the table view data as an Excel file to compare haplotype frequencies between populations and investigate the population diversity of HLA haplotypes.  

The haplotype structure shown in Figure 3 belongs to the Japanese population in our database. The most frequent haplotype we observe $(\mathrm{HLA{-}A{*}}24{:}02{\mathrm{-}}\mathrm{HLA{-}C{*}}12{:}02{-}$ HLA- $\mathbf{\cdotB}^{\ast}52{:01}$ –HLA-DRB1 $*15{:}02$ –HLA- $.{\mathrm{DQB1^{*}06:01-}}$ F $\mathrm{HLA\mathrm{-}D P A l^{\ast}02\mathrm{:01\mathrm{-}H L A\mathrm{-}D P B l^{\ast}09\mathrm{:01})}}$ is in concordance with the previous literature (33), largely validating our estimation of the haplotype frequency.  

To the best of our knowledge, long-range haplotype frequency information based on eight loci is only available for the three populations in the AFND database (until 15 July 2022). The $P G G.{\mathrm{MHC}}$ , however, integrates the haplotype structure of 134 populations, including 33 regional subpopulations in China. The population haplotype frequencies we offer are fundamental to disease association studies, population genetics studies, and HLA-matching for HSCT.  

# ONLINE ANALYSIS  

# HLA imputation  

HLA imputation is an approach that infers HLA alleles for SNP genotyping data using a pre-constructed HLA reference panel, which can subsequently contribute to association studies and disease fine-mapping. PGG.MHC implements an imputation pipeline involving SNP2HLA (34) and offers users an online interface to perform imputation tasks with their data. As for reference panels, we not only include three public reference panels: 1000G REF (34), Pan-Asian (35) and KOR REF (36), but also offer two newly constructed reference panels, i.e. HuaBiao REF and PGG REF. HuaBiao REF is a population-specific reference panel based on 5002 WES samples, which we built to facilitate HLA imputation for Han Chinese data. PGG REF is based on 1836 WGS samples from diverse populations in Asia containing 13 350 SNPs in the HLA region, which can improve the imputation accuracy and typing resolution. Detailed information about reference panels can be found in Supplementary Table S3. The results containing the imputed genotype files in VCF format and the imputed 2-field resolution HLA alleles in TXT format will be sent to users via email. To facilitate the comprehension of this pipeline, users can download example input and output files or utilize the automatic filling button to have a try before operating their data.  

# HLA association  

HLA association is a method for performing case/control studies and investigating the HLA alleles associated with phenotypes or diseases. We implemented an association pipeline in the PGG.MHC server involving PyHLA (37) and offered a user-friendly online interface where users can upload HLA genotypes of samples or choose PGG.MHC samples to perform association. The HLA association interface allows users to choose PGG.MHC populations with a similar genetic structure to their target populations as controls can help to eliminate the influences of the heterogeneous genetic structure of case and control data on the statistical analysis. Moreover, the large sample size of $P G G.{\mathrm{MHC}}$ population can improve the power of association studies.  

# FUTURE DIRECTIONS  

Currently, PGG.MHC archives HLA alleles of 53 254 samples to capture global population diversity, especially in Asia. After HLA typing and genotype integration of the samples, we calculated the allele frequencies and estimated the haplotype frequencies of populations. We provided powerful query and interactive visualization interfaces for allele frequencies and populations. Moreover, we offered two online computer tools for genotype imputation and phenotype association of user-upload data. We expect PGG.MHC to serve as a repository for high-quality HLA allele and haplotype frequency data and facilitate the study of human genetics, vaccine and immunotherapy development, and other related fields.  

In the future, we will make an effort to archive as many samples as possible and offer HLA alleles of higher resolution. For the functionality of the database, we plan to develop an advanced haplotype frequency query interface where users can directly input HLA haplotypes or alleles to search. We also have a plan to improve the online analysis functions by visualizing the results to facilitate data interpretation.

# ABSTRACT  

The field of gene expression analysis continues to benefit from next-generation sequencing generated data, which enables transcripts to be measured with unmatched accuracy and resolution. But the highthroughput reads from these technologies also contain many errors, which can compromise the ability to accurately detect and quantify rare transcripts. Fortunately, techniques exist to ameliorate the affects of sequencer error. We present RecountDB, a secondary database derived from primary data in NCBI’s short read archive. RecountDB holds sequence counts from RNA-seq and $5^{\prime}$ capped transcription start site experiments, corrected and mapped to the relevant genome. Via a searchable and browseable interface users can obtain corrected data in formats useful for transcriptomic analysis. The database is currently populated with 2265 entries from 45 organisms and continuously growing. RecountDB is publicly available at: http://recountdb.cbrc.jp.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Sequencing-based transcriptome analysis has been a key area of biological inquiry for over a decade (1). In recent years, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized transcriptomics by providing comprehensive, high-resolution measurement of the transcripts in a given biological sample [reviewed in (2,3)]. For example, RNA-seq has been used to uncover new alternative splicing events and discover new genes (4). Furthermore, ${5}^{\prime}$ capping methods allow exact positional detection of transcription start sites and absolute quantification of transcripts (5).  

Despite such benefits, it has been recognized that highthroughput reads from NGS technologies also contain substantial error, for Illumina typically ranging from $0.3\%$ at the beginning of reads to $3.8\mathrm{-}25\%$ at the end (6); and that without proper attention this error can cause significant artifacts (7,8).  

Unfortunately, simply removing sequences that fail to map well to the genome does not solve this problem, as many genomes (e.g. mammalian) are repetitive enough that erroneous sequences may infortuitously map well to a similar sequence in a different part of the genome. Figure 1 illustrates how the sequencing error combined with a high dynamic range thwarts simple count threshold-based quality control.  

To address this problem, many tools have been developed for sequence correction. One class is aimed for genome sequencing (9–12). They assume the true sequences have roughly uniform abundance and identify erroneous sequence by their rareness. This approach is not suitable for transcriptome sequencing; where interesting transcripts (e.g. of transcription factors) often have low copy number. Recent extensions of these methods loosen the assumption of uniformity (13–15) but have not been evaluated for transcriptome analysis.  

Fortunately two correction tools have been designed for transcriptome analysis: FreClu (7) and RECOUNT (16). RECOUNT is designed to correct sequence count biases [including for those sequences which should have a zero count (17)] resulting from sequencing error in Solexa/ Illumina reads. It uses a probabilistic model to estimate the true expression reads based on their counts and quality scores, without using a reference genome (Figure 1). On a mouse, Solexa/Illumina, $5^{\prime}$ capped transcriptome data set, RECOUNT increased the count of genome mappable sequences by $13.85\%$ , and in some cases the correction qualitatively changed the biological conclusions drawn from the data (16). Although FreClu and RECOUNT use different algorithms, in our evaluation their overall correction was roughly comparable, but RECOUNT uses much less memory and made fewer large sequence count errors when applied to a simulated data set (16).

Figure 1. Effect of sequencing error on the sequence counts. Gray bars represent misread sequences. (a) True counts of input sequences; aaact and gactt are $3\times10^{5}$ and 600, respectively. (b) Output of sequencer. Due to sequencer error, misread sequences appear around each input sequence, like crumbs fallen off a cake. Unfortunately, the misreads of highly abundant sequence can have higher count than correct reads of rare sequences. Thus it is in general not possible to separate true and false sequences with a simple threshold. RECOUNT uses a probabilistic model to approximately infer (a) from (b).  

The NCBI sequence read archive (SRA) plays an important role in preserving experimental data generated from NGS technologies for further studies (18). Typically gene expression levels are obtained from this data by first mapping reads to the reference genome, and then using gene annotation resources such as Aceview (19) or RefSeq (20) to obtain the expression levels of known genes. As discussed above, it is highly desirable to apply sequence count correction before mapping, and convenient for biologists if this can be done for them. For these reasons we developed RecountDB, in which we provide precomputed results of mapping sequences with LAST (21) after sequence correction count with RECOUNT (16), for RNA-Seq and TSS-Seq experiments held in the SRA. RecountDB provides the mapped data in the de facto standard formats: PSL (22) and SAM/BAM (23), which can be directly forwarded to visualization and analysis software. Below we describe the database source, content and derivation in detail.  

# DATABASE CONTENTS AND FORMATS  

RecountDB has been publicly available since June 2010. The current version contains 2265 entries from 45 organisms, with read lengths from 17 bp to 100 bp. Figure 2 shows screen shots of a RecountDB keyword search. Results can be downloaded in three formats: TAB, PSL and SAM/BAM. Below we briefly describe each format.  

# TAB format  

RecountDB provides a simple format that we call the ‘TAB format’. This simple format holds one sequence per line, each line consisting of three tab separated fields: the sequence itself, its observed counts and its corrected count. This format provides minimal information for programmers who want to patch RECOUNT correction into their own genome mapping protocol.  

# PSL format  

The PSL (Pat Space Layout) format, used by BLAT and other UCSC tools (22), is a tab delimited format consisting of an optional header section and an alignment section. The alignment section consists of 21 fields documented at the UCSC site http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/ FAQformat.html#format2L.  

RecountDB provides alignments with 14 organisms in UCSC genomes that can be directly uploaded to the UCSC Genome browser (24) as a track. This enables biologists to visualize the transcriptome data together with the extensive annotation on gene structure, regulatory elements etc., available in other tracks.  

# SAM/BAM format  

RecountDB also provides data in BAM format, a compressed binary version of the SAM (Sequence Alignment/ Map) format (23). Many NGS analysis tools work with this format. BAM can be easily converted to SAM format with SAMtools (http://sourceforge.net/projects/ samtools/files/) (23). This format contains 11 mandatory fields important for alignment including the sequence and quality score information, which is not included in the PSL format.  

One feature of the SAM format definition is that it allows extension through the addition of extra fields. We take advantage of this by adding the observed and corrected sequence counts as the 14th and 15th fields (Figure 3).  

# COMPUTATIONAL PROTOCOL  

The NCBI SRA repository holds (NGS) data sets from various experiments. For our purposes we used only data from TSS-seq and RNA-seq experiments. These data sets are required to be submitted in FASTQ format, which encodes the quality of each base in the reads. We make use of the quality scores both for sequence count correction and during the mapping process.  

# Error Correction with RECOUNT  

RECOUNT (16) adopts the count correction method proposed by Beißbarth et al. (25), which is based on a probabilistic model which assumes that the probability of any particular sequence $s$ being misread as some other sequence $r$ is given along with the observed sequence counts. Conceptually, a directed weighted graph $G(V,E)$ is defined in which the vertices $V$ are the possible sequences and the edge weight from sequence $s$ to $r$ represents the probability of misreading $s$ as $r$ As outlined below, the probabilities are automatically derived from quality score information. To keep the computation manageable two approximations are used: (i) sequences with zero observed counts are excluded from consideration, (ii) edges representing very unlikely misread events are omitted, RECOUNT can do this approximately by a hamming distance threshold or more rigorously by a probability threshold. Currently RecountDB holds results for hamming distance one. Following Beißbarth et al. (25), RECOUNT uses a kind of Expectation-Maximization (EM) (26) procedure to infer the set of true counts that locally maximizes the likelihood of the observed reads.

Figure 2. RecountDB’s search interface. (a) The snapshot of the RecountDB entry page. Users can perform searches using keywords such as genome name, or type of study, or NCBI-SRA file ID. A browseable interface can also be accessed through the link in this page. (b) A typical RecountDB keyword search result page. Each entry contains basic information such as data submitter, type of study and sample source. The results are presented in three formats: TAB, PSL and SAM/BAM (see main text for explanation). The link in depicted as a globe symbol allows users to reach the NCBI-SRA primary site for the data, where the user can access the original FASTQ file.   
Figure 3. Additional fields provided in the RecountDB SAM format data. OC refers to observed count, and EC estimated count (after correction). ‘f’ refers to type of value (float) and is followed by the values of each type of count.  

To describe how RECOUNT derives misread probabilities; we define the consensus sequence of a read as the sequence called from that read (i.e. the concatenation of the most probable base at each position, using alphabetical order to break ties), and the reads of a sequence s as the set of reads whose consensus sequence is $s$ . Recall that for any read of $s.$ , the quality scores give the probability that $s$ should have been called as another sequence $r$ . Therefore RECOUNT estimates the probability of $r$ being misread as $s$ , as the harmonic average of that quantity for all reads of $s$ . Note that although RECOUNT is capable of utilizing non-uniform base miscall probabilities [for example on Illumina $\mathrm{\DeltaC\leftrightarrow\mathrm{T}}$ miscalls are particularly common (6)], the FASTQ data format found in the SRA only gives one quality score for each position. Thus the contents of RecountDB assume miscalled bases are equally likely to be any of the three possible choices.  

# Alignment of reads with LAST  

Count corrected mapping. LAST (http://last.cbrc.jp/) is a local alignment tool designed for fast and accurate genome alignment (21). Using it requires executing two programs: lastdb for constructing an index of the genome, and lastal for aligning queries using the index. The parameters listed below follow the recommendations of the LAST documentation.  

We indexed the reference genome of each relevant species using lastdb with option –m1111110, which stipulates a spaced seed ignoring mismatches at every seventh position, a pattern suitable for aligning short reads. For lastal we use the parameters: $-\mathtt{r6\_-q18}$ $-{\tt a}21-{\tt b}9-{\tt d}108-{\tt e}120;$ –r6 sets the match score to 6, –q18 the mismatch cost to 18, –a21 gap existence cost to 21 and –b9 gap extension cost to 9. The output of these alignments are provided in BAM format.  

Uncorrected mapping. For users interested in how RECOUNT changed the mapped results, we also provide uncorrected data in PSL format, mapped using LAST quality-score alignment. The parameters are $-\mathsf{Q1}-\mathsf{d1}08$ $\mathtt{-e120}$ . The option $-\mathsf{Q1}$ tells LAST to expect quality score information in FASTQ-Sanger format. $-\mathtt{d}108$ sets the minimum score for gapless alignments to 108 and $\mathtt{-e120}$ sets minimum score for gapped alignments to 120.  

Quality control. For both types of alignment, we only report alignments with high mapping probabilities. For this purpose we use the LAST script last–map– probs.py $\mathtt{-s150}$ . With this parameter setting, when mapping 50 bp reads to the human genome we expect a random spurious alignment to be mistakenly reported only once every few thousand reads.  

Format conversion. The default output of lastal is in MAF format. We converted this to PSL and SAM format using the maf–convert.py script, from the LAST package.  

# CONCLUSIONS  

Over the next years the availability of NGS transcriptome data will increase tremendously, covering a growing number of organisms, tissues, cell types and conditions. To obtain reliable conclusions from this data, accurate estimates of transcript abundance are needed. RecountDB can play a valuable role by providing count corrected RNA-Seq and TSS-Seq data in a convenient form.  

RecountDB is continuously updated in an automatic fashion. The compact representation of our data (i.e. TAB, PSL and the compressed BAM format) allow us to efficiently store the data. However, the number of amount of data is expected to increase very rapidly. To respond to this, apart from strengthening our hardware infrastructure we also plan to investigate the possibility applying more effective data compression techniques (27).  

Finally, as touched upon in the introduction, we note that sequence count correction is an area of intense research. As is true for the other methods, RECOUNT still has room for improvement—for example it assumes the quality scores are approximately accurate. In the future we plan to continue our efforts to improve RECOUNT and updated RecountDB accordingly.

# ABSTRACT  

T-box riboswitches constitute a large family of tRNAbinding leader sequences that play a central role in gene regulation in many gram-positive bacteria. Accurate inference of the tRNA binding to T-box riboswitches is critical to predict their cis-regulatory activity. However, there is no central repository of information on the tRNA binding specificities of T-box riboswitches, and de novo prediction of binding specificities requires advanced knowledge of computational tools to annotate riboswitch secondary structure features. Here, we present the T-box Riboswitch Annotation Database (TBDB, https://tbdb.io), an open-access database with a collection of 23,535 T-box riboswitch sequences, spanning the major phyla of 3,632 bacterial species. Among structural predictions, the TBDB also identifies specifier sequences, cognate tRNA binding partners, and downstream regulatory targets. To our knowledge, the TBDB presents the largest collection of feature, sequence, and structural annotations carried out on this important family of regulatory RNA.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Bacteria exploit a wide-range of cis-acting RNA regulatory elements to control gene expression in response to specific environmental stimuli. One strategy used for modulating gene expression involves using $5^{\prime}$ -UTR leader riboswitches to regulate transcription or translation $(1-$ 3). The transcriptional or translational logic of riboswitch leader sequences are conditionally dependent on the binding of a specific ligand (4).  

In the gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis, an analysis of cis-regulatory sequences in the upstream region of several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (ARS) genes revealed that non-aminoacylated-tRNAs can act as a positive regulator (5,6). The discovery of this regulatory mechanism was a major breakthrough in understanding the expression of ARSs under nutrient limiting conditions. The T-box leader sequence was the first classical ‘riboswitch’ family to be discovered, preceding the discovering of metabolite-binding ribo-regulators (6).  

T-box riboswitch leader sequences can link either transcription or translation of downstream genes to the aminoacylation-state of tRNA (7–10). In transcriptional regulation, the $3^{\prime}$ -end of T-box leader sequences folds into either a terminator structure, prematurely stopping transcription, or antiterminator structure, allowing transcription to proceed (Figure 1A). Translational regulation occurs through a similar two-state mechanism, whereby a ribosome-binding site is either structurally sequestered, preventing ribosome binding or exposed, allowing ribosome binding and translation (8).  

Mechanistic studies have revealed several interactions between T-box riboswitches and tRNAs. Classical Watson– Crick base pairing has been shown to occur between the Tbox riboswitch specifier sequence and the tRNA anticodon (11). Additional Watson-Crick base pairing between the tRNA acceptor end ( $5^{\prime}$ -NCCA-3′) and the first four residues of the T-box bulge ( $5^{\prime}$ -UGGN-3′) has also been shown, and is thought to be the source of control for regulatory logic (Figure 1B) (12,13). If uncharged tRNA binds to the T-box riboswitch, Watson–Crick base pairing between the T-box bulge $5^{\prime}$ -UGGN- $3^{\prime}$ sequence and tRNA acceptor end, along with additional stacking interactions, results in stabilization of the antiterminator (for transcriptional) or antisequestrator (for translational) folds. Additional contacts between the antiterminator:tRNA heteroduplex minor groove and conserved purines in Stem III stabilize this interaction (14,15). If instead charged-tRNA binds the T-box bulge $5^{\prime}$ -UGGN- $3^{\prime}$ , steric clashes prevent the full antiterminator/antisequestrator complex from forming leading the T-box riboswitch to adopt a terminator fold (for transcriptional regulation) or sequestrator fold (for translational regulation) (10,15).

Figure 1. T-box riboswitches are cis-regulatory elements that use tRNA as a ligand. T-box riboswitches control translation or transcription of downstream genes. When uncharged cognate tRNA binds the T-box riboswitch, transcription or translation can proceed through stabilization of the antiterminator/antisequestrator structures. If charged cognate tRNA binds the T-box riboswitch, a terminator/sequestrator secondary structure forms preventing transcription or translation of downstream gene. (A) An archetypal ‘two-state’ conformational switch of a transcriptional T-box riboswitch is shown with structural features labeled: $\mathrm{I}=\mathrm{Stem}\mathrm{~I~}$ ; $\mathrm{II}=\mathrm{Stem}\ \mathrm{II}$ ; $\mathrm{IIA/B}=\mathrm{Stem\IIA/B}$ ; $\mathrm{III}=\mathrm{Stem\III}$ ; $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{T}=$ antiterminator; $\mathrm{{T}=}$ terminator; Spec $\b=$ specifier sequence (blue); Tb $)\mathbf{X}=\Gamma$ -box $5^{\prime}$ -UGGN- $3^{\prime}$ sequence (gray). (B) Watson–Crick base pairing between T-box riboswitch and tRNA in two critical regions dictate T-box riboswitch binding specificity: (i) specifier:anticodon base pairing dictates tRNA specificity while (ii) T-box bulge $5^{\prime}$ -UGGN- $3^{\prime}$ sequence:tRNA acceptor end base pairing controls regulatory logic.  

The intricate and specific interactions between the Tbox riboswitch:tRNA pair can be leveraged for a variety of applications across basic research and bioengineering. For example, a recent study used a glyQS T-box riboswitch to engineer a ribozyme that can specifically charge tRNAGly for use in cell-free protein synthesis (16). T-box riboswitches also have the potential to be used as a generalizable ‘registry-of-parts’, capable of independently sensing amino acid levels in the environment (17). Furthermore, due to their prevalence and importance in gram-positive bacteria, T-box riboswitches are also being studied as targets for antibiotics (18,19). Bacterial genomes tend to have several uncharacterized genes with remote homologs whose functions cannot be reliably predicted from sequence similarity alone. In this regard, T-box riboswitch specifier prediction has been used as a tool to uncover the function of unknown cis-regulated genes (20,21). In one case, the predicted T-box riboswitch family was used to infer the substrate specificity of downstream amino acid transporters (22).  

Despite the identification of several thousand leader sequences across various databases, T-box riboswitch structures and functions remain under-characterized (20–28). Structural features of T-box riboswitches are critical to function and provide information regarding the evolution of lineage-specific T-box riboswitch sequences and respective structural adaptations (Supplementary Figure S1). For instance, the Stem I region varies widely in length, with the transcriptional T-box riboswitches having Stem I that are longer than those found in translational T-box riboswitches (8,20,21,29). Previous phylogenetic studies have also uncovered T-box riboswitch duplication events as well as changes in anticodon specificity in the Stem I region, suggesting a complex evolutionary history (21). Structural studies have also highlighted important sequence motifs in Stem II, such as the presence of a 5-purine string in the conserved S-turn that monitors the geometry of the specifier:anticodon interaction and even an F-box sequence in the Stem IIA/B region involved in pseudo-knot formation (30). Stem III has also been recognized as an integral part of the aminoacylation sensing domain. Sequence analysis reveals the presence of a conserved $5^{\prime}$ -RRRNG-Stem III-AA- $3^{\prime}$ motif responsible for rejection of $2^{\prime}$ -aminoacylated tRNAs (15). However, existing public databases which host putative T-box leader sequences do not attempt to fold and annotate structural features nor include potential tRNA binding specificities for T-box riboswitches. Currently, in silico structure prediction and feature extraction is required to both predict conserved structural regions and substrates from raw sequences, and therefore exists as a barrier for entry to anyone interested in T-box riboswitch research.  

Here, we present the T-box Riboswitch Annotation Database (TBDB), a compilation of T-box riboswitch sequences from various primary sources with detailed annotations to aid future research. The TBDB predicts putative transcriptional and translational T-box riboswitch sequences, annotates secondary structures, identifies functional features and downstream genes, finds cognate pairs of tRNAs from host organisms, calculates MFE (minimum free-energy) structures and provides rich visualization for known and predicted T-box riboswitch leader sequences (Figure 2). The TBDB is browsable at https://tbdb.io, with the entire database available to download as a single flat file. The TBDB aims to be a valuable resource for studying canonical, engineered, and mutant T-box riboswitch mechanisms and will provide a point-of-entry for studying regulation and interactions between T-box riboswitch:tRNA pairs (Supplementary Table 1). As a resource for the wider non-coding RNA community, the TBDB is the first structural and functionally annotated database for studying gene regulation by T-box riboswitches.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Data collection and sequence curation  

Class I T-box riboswitch (transcriptional) leader sequences used to generate the database were obtained from a variety of primary sources including the RFAM 14.0 database, RibEX database, GeConT3 database and others $^{(21,31-}$ 34). For class I transcriptional T-box riboswitch leader sequences that did not necessarily contain the terminator (RFAM and GeConT3 sequences) Entrez (NCBI) was used to extend sequences by $50\ \mathrm{nt}$ . Extended sequences were then subsequently trimmed to end in penta poly-U $3^{\prime}$ - UUUUU). Sequences from these databases that were too short $(\mathord{<}100\mathrm{nt})$ , too long $\left(>500\mathrm{nt}\right)$ , or redundant were also removed. Sequences of translational T-box riboswitches (class II) were found by using our custom covariance model (Supplementary Figure S2) to perform an INFERNAL search on all NCBI reference genomes in the Actinobacteria phylum (TaxID:1760) (35). The class II covariance model was additionally applied on T-box riboswitch sequences detected by the class I model but predicted to have a truncated Stem I (Supplementary Figure S3).

Figure 2. Construction of TBDB. T-box riboswitch structures were predicted from input sequences using INFERNAL and RNAfold (Vienna RNA) (35,36). T-box riboswitch features (specifier sequence and T-box riboswitch sequence) were extracted from structural predictions. For input sequences where genomic information was not provided, BLAST (NCBI) was used to identify genetic locus within host. Entrez (NCBI) queries were used to compile all genomic sequence records of the host organisms including genes found downstream of T-box riboswitch input sequences. tRNAscan-SE was run on all genomes to find tRNAs in the hosts with anticodons that are reverse complements of T-box riboswitch specifier sequences (39). Predicted structures were refined using ViennaRNA (36). Refined structures, with predicted features, were visualized as 2D representations using VARNA (40). Minimum free energy (MFE) calculations were performed using ViennaRNA on refined terminator and antiterminator/antisequestrator structures.  

# Structural and thermodynamic prediction of T-box riboswitch leaders  

INFERNAL was used to predict the secondary structure of input sequences using either the RFAM 14.0 class I T-box riboswitch covariance model (RF00230.cm) (34,35), or our class II T-box riboswitch covariance model (Supplementary Figure S4). The INFERNAL output structure, corresponding to the antiterminator/antisequestrator fold, was then used to predict T-box riboswitch features according to the conserved patterns of stems and loops. Next, the MFE (Supplementary Figure S5) of the structure was evaluated using RNAfold (ViennaRNA) (36). For putative transcriptional T-box riboswitches, the terminator structure was determined by searching for a suitable terminator hairpin using RNALfold. The MFEs of both folds were calculated using RNAeval. Structures for sequestrator stems from translational T-box riboswitches are not currently predicted. Summary of MFE for Tbox riboswitches represented in the TBDB are shown in Supplementary Table 2. Detailed descriptions of the feature extraction and thermodynamic prediction are available in the Supporting Information.  

# Pairing T-box riboswitches with putative cognate tRNAs  

Top specifier sequence predictions were used to identify a putative tRNA family pair for each T-box riboswitch. To find the sequence of cognate tRNA, Entrez (NCBI) was used to query for all genomic records of the T-box riboswitch host organism. Genome sequences, either partial or full, were downloaded from RefSeq or GenBank (37,38). tRNAscan-SE (Lowe Lab, UCSC) was used to identify tRNAs in each host organism (39). tRNAs with predicted anticodons matching the specifier were considered paired. For cases where more than one possible tRNA gene was possible, a single tRNA was chosen from among the matching tRNAs for display. tRNA visualization was generated using VARNA (40).  

# Prediction of T-box riboswitch specifier sequence  

The T-box riboswitch specifier region was assigned as the 1- 5 bp (inclusive) $5^{\prime}$ - from the end of the Stem I specifier bulge. In these five bases, three possible specifier sequence frames $(^{\leftarrow}-1^{\ '},~{^{\leftarrow}+0^{\ '}},~{^{\leftarrow}+1^{\ '}})$ were examined for meeting specifiermatch criteria. For each possible specifier, we identified the putative tRNA family (by matching anticodon) that would bind. We then checked to see if (i) the predicted tRNA family had a discriminator base that could base pair with the T-box ${5}^{\prime}$ -UGGN- $3^{\prime}$ sequence, with wobble allowed, and (ii) if the predicted tRNA amino acid family matched the downstream gene ontology (where available). In the case of predicted His T-box riboswitches, discriminator matching was not used as a criterion as mature $\mathrm{\tRNA^{His}}$ transcripts can have a paired discriminator base (41).  

For matching T-box $5^{\prime}$ -UGGN- $3^{\prime}$ with tRNA acceptor end $5^{\prime}$ -NCCA- $3^{\prime}$ sequence, we first searched the host for all tRNAs of a given tRNA family and identified which discriminator base that specific host used for a particular tRNA. In cases where we could not identify matching tRNAs in the host organism, the bacterial discriminator base frequency information was extracted from tRNAviz and utilized in the specifier prediction model (42). The top specifier was then assigned as the specifier that met most of these conditions, equally weighted, with preference given in the following order: $^{\cdot}+0^{\cdot}>^{\cdot}-1^{\cdot}>^{\cdot}+1^{,}$ specifier sequence frames. In cases where more than one specifier was possible, the top specifier was assigned as mentioned but alternative specifier sequence frames are also provided in TBDB.  

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  

# Accessing TBDB content  

The TBDB aims to be a comprehensive and approachable hub for predictions of T-box riboswitch structure and function. Database entries are provided in a searchable, tabulated format. Users can query entries based on fields that include sequence, host organism, specifier sequence,  

T-box $5^{\prime}$ -UGGN- $3^{\prime}$ sequence, or predicted tRNA family (Supplementary Figure S6).  

Detailed information on each TBDB entry can be obtained by accessing the unique ID in the database table. Doing so brings users to a T-box riboswitch entry page that contains source, downstream protein annotation, structural, functional, and sequence information. The title of the entry page provides the T-box riboswitch ID, a unique identifier generated by TBDB, as well as the predicted tRNA family the T-box riboswitch interacts with in the host organism (Supplementary Figure S7). The source information panel gives a high-level summary of the T-box riboswitch entry and includes information regarding genetic locus and feature predictions. The following panel provides an interactive genome browser (NCBI) starting at the Tbox leader sequence locus and ending 5,000 bp downstream. The genome browser allows users to visualize the genomic context of T-box riboswitch leader sequences and provides a quick method to assess the validity of T-box riboswitch specifier predictions. For example, a Trp T-box riboswitch is observed as a $5^{\prime}$ -UTR of an operon involved in tryptophan biosynthesis (Supplementary Figure S8).  

Towards the goal of making a T-box riboswitch registryof-parts, in the subsequent panel we provide a T-box riboswitch sequence that stretches from the Stem I to the terminator poly-U region (for transcriptional T-box riboswitches, Supplementary Figure S9). Visualizations (VARNA) of the predicted secondary structures of the T-box riboswitch are given in the next panel (40). These 2D representations highlight important features of the T-box riboswitch entry including Stem I (lightyellow), possible specifier sequence (dark-yellow), antiterminator/antisequestrator (light-blue), the four nucleotide $5^{\prime}$ -UGGN- $3^{\prime}$ in the T-box bulge (dark blue), and terminator stem (red). The dot-bracket representations of the 2D structures are also provided (Supplementary Figure S10). Results for tRNA matching, generated using tRNAscan-SE, can be found in the following panel (Supplementary Figure S11) (39). Here, we show the sequence and description for the highest scoring predicted tRNA, with matching anticodon, in T-box riboswitch host organism (if available). tRNAs for alternative specifier sequence frames are also generated if our model could not identify a consensus specifier. Minimum free energy (MFE) predictions for each of the folds are given in the thermodynamics section, and are the result of structure refinement performed using ViennaRNA (Supplementary Figure S12) (36).  

Finally, the INFERNAL panel has output information from structural searches, which can be used as a reference by users interested in structure prediction information and quality (Supplementary Figure S13). Here, users will also find information about predicted boundaries of important structural features. We believe the TBDB sequence demarcation features of the important Stem I, Stem II, Stem III, antiterminator/antisequestrator and terminator/sequestrator regions will spur future efforts to explore common themes and diversity that T-box riboswitches have accrued and help aid in their classification.  

# Identification of T-box riboswitch:tRNA pairs  

T-box riboswitches tend to have a strict preference for canonical Watson–Crick base pairing between the specifier sequence and the anticodon of the cognate tRNA (9). Depending on the length of the specifier bulge, it is also likely that there are alternative specifier sequences, allowing for the possibility of multi-tRNA specificity in gene regulation (43). However, experimental work uncovering the determinants of multi-specificity in T-box riboswitches remains sparse. Our specifier prediction assignment takes into consideration downstream gene ontology and base pairing between the T-box bulge $5^{\prime}$ -UGGN- $3^{\prime}$ sequence and the tRNA acceptor end found in the host organism. In assigning T-box riboswitch specifier, priority was given to as the region 2-4 bp (inclusive) $5^{\prime}$ - from the end of the Stem I specifier bulge, though $\cdot_{-1},$ and $\cdot_{+1},$ specifier sequence frames were also considered (Supplementary Figure S1). In a majority of the cases, the variable position ( $5^{\prime}.$ - UGGN-3′) on the T-box bulge shows Watson-Crick base pairing with the discriminator base ( $5^{\prime}$ -NCCA- $3^{\prime}$ ) of the cognate tRNA species. Exceptions were noted in the Trp family, where $46\%$ of T-box riboswitches in our collection have a ‘U’ at the degenerate position while their cognate tRNAs have a $\mathbf{\nabla}^{\mathcal{\epsilon}}\mathbf{G}^{\prime}$ at the discriminator position, suggesting a G:U wobble pair, as has been previously noted (41). Based on this observation we allowed for wobble base pairs between the tRNA discriminator and the degenerate nucleotide in the ${5}^{\prime}$ -UGGN- $3^{\prime}$ region of the T-box bulge sequence in our final model. In the case of putative His T-box riboswitches, discriminator base matching was not considered as $\mathrm{\tRNA^{His}}$ transcripts can have an internally paired discriminator base (41).  

In practice, the TBDB identifies the cognate tRNA pairs from T-box riboswitch hosts by first predicting the specifier sequence, then searching genome records of respective hosts for tRNAs that have a matching anticodon (Watson–Crick base pairing, no wobble allowed) and discriminator base pairing (both Watson-Crick and wobble pairing allowed). Our model gave a single specifier sequence frame prediction for 16,258 T-box riboswitch leader sequences, two possible specifier sequence frames for 2,884 sequences, and three specifier sequence frames for 3,551 sequences. For 48 sequences, we were able to predict a specifier but were unable to find the canonical $5^{\prime}$ -UGGN- $3^{\prime}$ sequence in the T-box bulge. In cases where more than one specifier is possible, preference is given to the $\cdot_{+0},$ specifier sequence frame (Supplementary Figure S1C). In all, T-box riboswitch leaders containing Trp-, Leu- and Ile- tRNA matching specifiers were most commonly observed in our collection while Lys-, Gluand Gln- matching specifiers were the least common, well in agreement with previous findings (20). Supplementary Table 1A and B show composition of the T-box Riboswitch Annotation Database amino acid family and specifier usage.  

Through our tRNA search, we were able to match $79.4\%$ of T-box riboswitches for which we predicted a specifier with a tRNA of the native host. Grouping T-box riboswitches by specifier sequence, we found that tRNAmatching was ${>}80\%$ for most specifiers (Supplementary

Table 1B). Interestingly, we only identified a tRNA pair for $8.6\%$ of T-box riboswitches with $3^{\prime}$ -U specifiers, consistent with observations that $5^{\prime}{\cdot}\mathbf{A}$ starting anticodons in bacterial tRNAs are rare (Supplementary Table 1C). In these cases, it is possible that these T-box riboswitches are controlled by tRNAs without matching anticodons (e.g. relying on wobble base pairing) or are using an alternative specifier sequence frame when binding anticodons (44). Alternative specifier sequence frames for T-box riboswitch sequences have previously been observed in at least one experimentally studied system (43).  

# T-box riboswitch specifier usage  

Identifying specifier sequences for T-box riboswitches allowed us to interrogate the choice of tRNA anticodon, and therefore the tRNA, that is used for regulation. Analogous to ‘codon usage tables’, which summarize an organism’s codon preference for translating particular amino acid, Table 1 depicts a ‘specifier usage table’ generated from 23,535 sequences in the TBDB. For T-box riboswitches of amino acid families that only have two codons (Lys, Asp, Asn, Glu, Gln, His, Tyr, Cys, Phe), a single specifier is preferred in over $85\%$ of corresponding T-box riboswitch sequences. The choice of specifier is also consistent, with $3^{\prime}{\bf-A}$ and $3^{\prime}{\mathrm{-}}\mathrm{C}$ always favored over $3^{\prime}\mathrm{-}\mathrm{\bfG}$ and $3^{\prime}$ -U respectively. T-box riboswitches of amino acid families decoded by four codons (Gly, Ala, Pro, Val, Thr) have more diversity in specifier usage. Much like the two-codon sets, there is a preference for Val, Thr and Gly T-box riboswitches to use $3^{\prime}$ -A and $3^{\prime}{\mathrm{-}}\mathrm{C}$ specifiers. Interestingly, Ala and Pro T-box riboswitches display a preference for $3^{\prime}–\mathrm{U}$ specifiers. T-box riboswitch families for amino acids with 6 codons (Leu, Ser, Arg) show a $3^{\prime}$ - A and $3^{\prime}–\mathrm{C}$ preference, with an even stronger preference for $3^{\prime}–\mathbf{C}$ specifiers. In the particular case of Leu family T-box riboswitches, the CUC specifier is observed in $74\%$ of sequences. For the special case of Ile, $3^{\prime}$ -C (AUC) specifier is preferred. The large collection of sequences has allowed us to reinforce previous observations that the $\mathrm{{}^{\circ}C}$ -rule’ ( $3^{\prime}{\mathrm{-}}\mathrm{C}$ in specifiers) is prevalent, while additionally discovering that $3^{\prime}$ -A usage is also largely preferred for specific amino acid classes (Supplementary Table 1B and C) (20,21,32). Indeed, recent structural analysis reveals that a non-canonical Aminor motif in the Stem II S-turn places local constraints directly to prefer a guanine on the tRNA anticodon, and therefore a cytosine in the third position of the specifier (15,30).  

There are possible explanations for the source of specifier-usage bias in T-box riboswitches. First, specifier usage does not follow the same observed patterns of codon usage. In most cases, the preferred specifier is the least preferred codon for the amino acid family. For example in the taxonomic order Bacillales, the Phe UUU codon is used in approximately $70\%$ of cases for translation (45), but is present in only $1\%$ of Phe Tbox riboswitch specifiers. One possible hypothesis for the specifier-use bias could be attributed to T-box riboswitches favoring interaction with a single tRNA species and disfavoring wobble base pairing. In the absence of tRNA with $5^{\prime}{\mathrm{-}}\mathrm{I}$ (Inosine) anticodons, $3^{\prime}{\bf-A}$ and $3^{\prime}–\mathrm{C}$ codons are only decoded by a single tRNA species ( ${[5^{\prime}-\mathsf{U}}$ and $5^{\prime}{\mathrm{-}}\mathrm{C}$ anticodons), whereas $3^{\prime}\mathrm{-}\mathrm{\bf{G}}$ and $3^{\prime}$ -U codons can be decoded by multiple tRNAs $(5^{\prime}\mathrm{-}\mathrm{}\mathrm{}\mathrm{}\mathrm{U}/\mathrm{C}$ and $5^{\prime}{\mathrm{-}}\mathbf{A}/\mathbf{G}$ anticodons). Tbox riboswitches likely co-evolved to be highly specific in their response towards a single tRNA species, which would have been made more difficult if specifier binding is made competitive with two (or more) tRNA species (WatsonCrick basepair versus wobble). Additionally, tRNAs with $5^{\prime}{\cdot}\mathbf{A}$ anticodons are not prevalent in bacteria, as the U:G wobble-pair is the preferred mechanism for decoding $3^{\prime}.$ -U codons (46). The consensus sequence of the 23,535 T-box riboswitches (Supplementary Figure S1) revealed that ${5}^{\prime}{.}$ - NNC- $3^{\prime}$ specifiers were preferred overall, being represented at $59.9\%$ of T-box riboswitch sequences with predicted specifiers.  

# Tool for T-box riboswitch scanning and feature extraction  

In order to increase accessibility and reproducibility for detection and annotation of T-box riboswitches for arbitrary DNA sequences, we have also released a standalone CLI tool (tbox-scan) for finding and extracting features of T-box riboswitches. Tbox-scan uses  

INFERNAL to find T-box riboswitches in a FASTA sequence input, and then performs the same feature extraction used to build the TBDB. As outputs, the tool displays T-box riboswitch location, specifier sequence, T-box bulge $5^{\prime}$ -UGGN- $3^{\prime}$ sequence, and secondary structure prediction of antiterminator/antisequestrator and terminator folds. Covariance models for putative transcriptional (class I) and putative translational (class II) T-box riboswitches are also provided. Users can download tbox-scan from https://tbdb.io/tools/tbox-scan.html.  

# CONCLUSION  

T-box leader sequences were the first riboswitches to be discovered, yet remain under characterized. Of the known ${}>20{,}000$ sequences, few have been tested for regulatory activity. Currently, T-box riboswitch research is stymied by the necessity of secondary structure modeling to resolve which tRNA binds a given Tbox riboswitch. Through a compilation of sequence information from multiple sources, the TBDB increases access to T-box riboswitch functional information. The TBDB has aggregated and processed over 23,000 T-box riboswitch sequences from 3,632 bacterial species in order to identify structural features and tRNA binding partners (Supplementary Figure S14). The TBDB aims to be an approachable hub for the riboswitch community and in future version aims to integrate well with experiments for both natural and engineered T-box riboswitches. As more experiments are being carried out in this area, additional feature annotations will become available - such as predictive models for tandem T-box riboswitches, structural annotation of Stem IIA/B pseudoknots, K-turn motifs, sub-structure analysis, and mutability of synthetic T-box riboswitches.

# ABSTRACT  

Database annotations of prokaryotic genomes and eukaryotic mRNA sequences pay relatively low attention to frame transitions that disrupt protein-coding genes. Frame transitions (frameshifts) could be caused by sequencing errors or indel mutations inside protein-coding regions. Other observed frameshifts are related to recoding events (that evolved to control expression of some genes). Earlier, we have developed an algorithm and software program GeneTack for ab initio frameshift finding in intronless genes. Here, we describe a database (freely available at http://topaz.gatech. edu/GeneTack/db.html) containing genes with frameshifts (fs-genes) predicted by GeneTack. The database includes 206 991 fs-genes from 1106 complete prokaryotic genomes and 45 295 frameshifts predicted in mRNA sequences from 100 eukaryotic genomes. The whole set of fs-genes was grouped into clusters based on sequence similarity between fs-proteins (conceptually translated fs-genes), conservation of the frameshift position and frameshift direction $(-1,\ +1)$ . The fs-genes can be retrieved by similarity search to a given query sequence via a web interface, by fs-gene cluster browsing, etc. Clusters of fs-genes are characterized with respect to their likely origin, such as pseudogenization, phase variation, etc. The largest clusters contain fs-genes with programed frameshifts (related to recoding events).  

# INTRODUCTION  

Frameshifts predicted by ab initio program GeneTack (1) correspond to reading frame transitions. The transition could be caused by many reasons, among them sequencing errors (2), indel mutations (3), programed frameshifting events (4–6), phase variation (7), overlapping of adjacent genes (8), dual-coding regions (9) and eukaryotic alternative splicing (10).  

Although sequencing errors are artifacts of sequencing technologies, authentic indel mutations are features of real sequences. These mutations usually lead to gene pseudogenization; still some pseudogenization remain conserved in evolution if the transcript (not truncated contrary to the protein product) carry some function (11).  

In case of phase variation, reversible indel mutations occur at high frequencies at specific sites. They generate a population of bacteria with heterogeneous sequences of phase variant gene, thus increasing population fitness, for example it may help some bacterial pathogens to escape immune response of a host (12). Phase variation results in reversible and inheritable variation of bacterial phenotype.  

Programed frameshifting occurs either during translation (PRF, programed ribosomal frameshifting) or transcription (PTR, programed transcriptional realignment). PRF and PTR violate standard triplet decoding allowing for a single protein to be produced from two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). Hence, GeneTack predicts frame transition between these ORFs. PRF and PTR occur at sites with specific sequence patterns conserved in evolution because programed frameshifting is required for gene expression. Programed frameshifting usually results in synthesis of two protein products (standard and frameshift) that share the same N-terminal sequence but possess different C-terminal parts. Among chromosomal genes, the best studied examples are bacterial prfB gene encoding Release Factor 2 (13) and eukaryotic genes encoding ornithine decarboxylase antizyme (14). PRF is abundant in viruses (15), bacteriophages and transposons (16,17). The largest available collection of known PRF genes is available in the Recode database (18).  

A frameshift could be predicted when two coding sequences (CDSs) that are in different frames and located close to each other or overlap. Notably, a co-location of some of the CDS pairs could be evolutionary conserved if expression of the two genes is linked by translational coupling mechanism. Such gene pairs predicted as fs-genes are present in the GeneTack database as well.  

Eukaryotic part of the database was built using known mRNA sequences; a large number of predicted fs-genes was found in alternative spliced transcripts containing premature termination codons (PTCs) (10,19). This fact is not surprising taking into account that in mammals upto one-third of alternative splicing (AS) events produce PTC-containing splice variants (20,21).  

The database contains fs-genes that represent possible dual coding in eukaryotic mRNAs. Dual coding allows the same stretch of DNA to encode two protein sequences in different frames (22). Multiple instances of dual coding in human genome were detected by the analysis of ribosomal profiling data obtained from HeLa cells (23). Several instances of dual coding are well studied, such as the xbp1 gene encoding $\mathbf{\boldsymbol{x}}$ -box binding protein 1. The products of initial rounds of xbp1 mRNA translation facilitate endonuclease-mediated excision of a 26-nt fragment of its own mRNA. As a result, mRNA downstream of excision appears in a different frame (24) and different protein product is synthesized from the same mRNA at the later rounds of translation. Another well-studied example (9) is expression from the GNAS1 locus (coding for Guanine Nucleotide binding protein Alpha Subunit 1) an alternative protein called ALEX (‘‘ALternative gene product Encoded by XL-exon’’). Similarly, tumor suppressor proteins P16(INK4a) and P14(ARF) are produced from the same gene, where the same sequence appears in alternative frames in two alternative transcripts (25). Due to the codon co-dependency of overlapping frames (26) dual coding regions have unusual codon frequencies that make them prone to frameshift prediction by GeneTack.  

The GeneTack database contains all types of frame transition events (prokaryotic and eukaryotic); $\sim20\%$ of the entries have been characterized in terms of the probable nature of predicted frame transition.  

To help explore the nature of predicted fs-genes, they were grouped into clusters of orthologous fs-genes based on sequence similarity, conservation of frameshift direction $(-1,+1)$ and location. We characterized the fs-genes that formed the largest clusters based on comparative genomics analysis (Antonov I et al., submitted for publication). Although the nature of ${>}80\%$ of the predicted frameshifts was not revealed (at least $1.5\%$ have a strong evidence to be sequencing errors, whereas upto $54\%$ could be related to sequencing errors), this database will be useful for improving annotation of new genomes, re-annotation of old ones as well as for stimulating experimental studies leading to identification of new programed events and other cases of frame transitions under evolutionary selection.  

# DATABASE STATISTICS AND USAGE  

The data are stored in a local MySQL database queried by CGI scripts embedded in the web interface. The database also includes some pre-built data, such as Sequence LOGOs (27) of conserved motifs observed in overlapping ORFs for all the clusters.  

The database consists of two sections—prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Notably, the method of frameshift prediction was slightly different in prokaryotic genomic DNA and eukaryotic mRNA. For prokaryotes, genes in a complete genome sequence were predicted by GeneMarkS (28), the self-training program that derived parameters both for itself, as well as for GeneTack. A single statistical model was generated for each prokaryotic genome and use in GeneTack.  

Eukaryotic genes with frameshifts were identified in mature mRNA sequences. Several HMM models were generated for each eukaryotic genus. Each model was generated by a self-training algorithm, a version of GeneMarkS, from a set of mRNAs with a close GC percent content. All the eukaryotic and prokaryotic models are available at the GeneTack web page; a database user can choose an appropriate pre-built model for a query sequence.  

Currently, the database contains fs-genes from 1106 prokaryotic and 100 eukaryotic species (Table 1). Since the length of prokaryotic genomes as well as the total size of available eukaryotic mRNAs vary for different species, the number of predicted fs-genes also varies. For example, in 115 001 human mRNAs, we predicted 8700 frameshifts, whereas only 839 frameshifts were predicted in $32155\ \mathrm{mRNA}$ sequences of Rattus norvegicus. Conceptual translation of predicted fs-genes produced a database of fs-proteins used for clustering. All over, $50\%$ of prokaryotic and $27\%$ of eukaryotic fs-genes formed clusters, whereas other fs-genes were singletons.

The database home page is the user’s entry point. The user can browse prokaryotic or eukaryotic clusters of fs-genes, perform sequence similarity search by BLASTp for a query sequence of interest or search for fs-genes or clusters using a query string. The query string could be fs-gene/cluster identification number (ID) or cluster name.  

Majority of the clusters were named using names of Pfam domain detected in the cluster of fs-proteins. However, several clusters (e.g. known cases of programed frameshifting) were manually renamed to reflect gene and protein names. Thus, Release Factor 2 cluster can be found by using the gene name ‘prfB’ as a query.  

To allow search against the GeneTack database of fs-proteins, two BLASTp databases (containing either prokaryotic or eukaryotic fs-proteins) were built. The BLASTp hit may reveal the nature of a frameshift mechanism in a novel sequence.  

Finally, a user can browse sections of either of the two databases in the following ways. First, a particular species can be selected from a list of species. For a given species, a list of all the predicted fs-genes is available (Figure 1). The list provides information about every frameshift such as its direction and genomic coordinates. More detailed information about an fs-gene can be accessed by clicking on the fs-gene ID. A page with frameshift details provides the following information: the species name, the frameshift coordinate (in the prokaryotic genome or the eukaryotic mRNA), the frameshift direction $^{(+1}$ or $-1\dot{}$ ), the coordinates of the fs-gene, its length and the length of encoded protein. The initial fs-gene sequence (with a frameshift), the corrected fs-gene sequence and the sequence of conceptually translated protein product are available as well. Additional information for a frameshift includes reference to the BLASTp/Pfam hit if it did occur to cover predicted frameshift position in the fs-protein. Link to the corresponding cluster is provided if the fs-gene belongs to the cluster. It should be noted that an fs-gene can belong to one cluster only.  

Another way of browsing the database is by using a probable type of fs-gene. Some of the predicted fs-genes and the clusters of the fs-genes were grouped together based on their types. Each group of the clusters (for example, all prokaryotic programed frameshift clusters) can be seen as a list on a single web page with general information about each cluster.  

The type of a cluster was predicted using a range of cluster’s gene features. To identify programed frameshift clusters, sequences in the vicinities of the frameshifts were analyzed in order to find a conserved motif that would resemble a frameshift site. Protein products from pseudogene clusters must have BLASTp hits in nr database indicating that predicted frameshift is a result of an indel mutation. Elevated frequency of tandem repeats near predicted frameshifts was chosen as a characteristic property of a phase variation clusters. On the other hand, conserved start codons for downstream ORF2 are expected in the vicinity of the frameshifts in translational coupling clusters.  

There are a number of large clusters for which the nature was not predicted but they may be of interest to research community. To provide access to these clusters, additional groups were introduced: clusters with $100+$ and 50–100 fs-genes (in case of prokaryotes) and $10+$ fs-genes (in case of eukaryotes), so clusters could be retrieved by size.  

Additionally, during the search for prokaryotic programed frameshift clusters, we have analyzed the frameshift vicinities and grouped clusters by the most overrepresented heptamer. The heptamers include special symbols (underscores) to indicate the reading frame of the upstream ORF1.  

The cluster details page contains the same information as the fs-gene details page except that the information is provided for all the clusters’ fs-genes together, e.g. a multi-fasta file where all the fs-gene or the fs-protein sequences are provided instead of a single sequence. The cluster information page may also include figures visualizing frequencies of nucleotides in conserved motifs (sequence LOGOs) located close to the frameshift position, as well as the distributions of frameshift coordinates and the fs-gene lengths (Figure 2). Sequence LOGOs were generated with the MEME software package (29).

Red bars in the lower panel correspond to frameshift positions and green bars show the total length of fs-proteins. The small green bars indicate existence of subgroups of longer fs-proteins.  

# TOOLS FOR FRAMESHIFT PREDICTION  

Besides the database, the GeneTack server contains a number of tools for frameshift identification in nucleotide sequences. There are four main programs—GeneTackGM (1), GeneTack-Prok (1), GeneTack-Euk (Antonov I et al., manuscript in preparation) and MetaGeneTack (Tang S et al., accepted for publication to Bioinformatics).  

GeneTack-GM is a combination of frameshift prediction program GeneTack and a self-training gene prediction program GeneMarkS (28). GeneTack-GM could be used to predict frameshfits in long prokaryotic sequences (longer than $300\mathrm{kB}_{,}$ ). The model parameters are automatically generated by a self-training program GeneMarkS. GeneTack-GM also includes a number of filters to remove false-positive predictions.  

GeneTack-Prok and GeneTack-Euk can be used to analyze shorter prokaryotic and eukaryotic sequences with length insufficient for self-training. Eukaryotic sequences must be intronless, e.g. mRNAs or expression sequence tags (ESTs) can be used. Both programs feature a number of pre-built species-specific models. A user should choose the one that corresponds to the input sequence. No filters are applied to the frameshifts predicted by these two programs.  

GeneTack cannot be directly applied to short metagenomic sequences because it requires a speciesspecific statistical model. Yet another ab initio frameshift finder, MetaGeneTack, can be used in this case (Tang S et al., accepted for publication). MetaGeneTack uses heuristic models (30) and applies several additional filters for removing false-positive predictions.  

# APPLICATION OF THE TOOLS AND DATABASE  

The GeneTack tools predict frameshifts in all types of sequences. Using one of the tools, a user can find candidate genes with frameshfits in a new prokaryotic genome, contig or metagenome or explore a single protein-coding mRNA for a presence of frameshifts. The predicted fs-genes are automatically translated into fs-proteins that could be used as queries against GeneTack database. Hits to large clusters will show phylogenetic conservation of the frameshift. An association with a large cluster can be used to argue that the predicted frameshift is not a result of sequencing error. Moreover, if the type of the cluster is known (e.g. programed frameshift) it is likely that the input sequence has a frameshift of the same type as well.  

# AVAILABILITY  

The interface to GeneTack database is at http://topaz. gatech.edu/GeneTack/db.html. All data are available for download as flat files (sequences in fasta format) and also as a set of MySQL relational database files. Each fs-gene as well as each fs-gene cluster has a unique ID.

# ABSTRACT  

DNAtraffic (http://dnatraffic.ibb.waw.pl/) is dedicated to be a unique comprehensive and richly annotated database of genome dynamics during the cell life. It contains extensive data on the nomenclature, ontology, structure and function of proteins related to the DNA integrity mechanisms such as chromatin remodeling, histone modifications, DNA repair and damage response from eight organisms: Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Escherichia coli and Arabidopsis thaliana. DNAtraffic contains comprehensive information on the diseases related to the assembled human proteins. DNAtraffic is richly annotated in the systemic information on the nomenclature, chemistry and structure of DNA damage and their sources, including environmental agents or commonly used drugs targeting nucleic acids and/or proteins involved in the maintenance of genome stability. One of the DNAtraffic database aim is to create the first platform of the combinatorial complexity of DNA network analysis. Database includes illustrations of pathways, damage, proteins and drugs. Since DNAtraffic is designed to cover a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines, it has to be extensively linked to numerous external data sources. Our database represents the result of the manual annotation work aimed at making the DNAtraffic much more useful for a wide range of systems biology applications.  

# INTRODUCTION  

A comprehensive understanding of the maintenance of DNA integrity during the cell life requires the thorough characterization of many simple data concerning all nuclear processes involving DNA, and including replication, repair, recombination (3R) and transcription. The major processes that regulate chromatin structure and counterbalance its repressive effects are: (i) chromatin remodeling, (ii) post-translational histone modifications and (iii) histone replacement. Chromatin is a dynamic structure that modulates the access of regulatory factors to the genetic material. The main role of DNA molecules is the long-term storage of information, genetic instruction used in the development and functioning of all known living organisms (with the exception of RNA viruses). Cells are continuously exposed to damaging agents whose action results in modification of nucleic acids. DNA damage from endogenous sources gives rise to 20 000 lesions/mammalian cell/day (1). Lesions are also caused by errors in DNA metabolic processes, including the formation of single and double-strand breaks from the collapse of replication forks and the introduction of modified nucleic acid bases during DNA replication. Counting all together, daily the $10^{\widetilde{16}}–10^{18}$ repair events occur in a healthy adult man ( $10^{12}$ cells) (2). On the other hand, DNA damage is also caused by the environmental factors such as chemicals, UV light and ionizing radiation. Also, DNA structure and some proteins involved in DNA replication and repair are targets for the drugs used during chemotherapy (3). The available anticancer drugs have distinct mechanisms of action, which may vary in their effects on different types of normal and cancer cells. Their role is to slow and hopefully halt the growth and spread of a cancer.  

Across the evolutionary spectrum, living organisms depend on high-fidelity DNA replication and recombination mechanisms have to response to DNA damage and balance between the harmful and beneficial effects of manipulation into the genetic code. The knowledge of the processes in charge of DNA metabolism is critical to our understanding of how and why the genome is affected during the lifespan of the organism, and how the DNA repair systems efficiently work via several different pathways to protect the genome from potential mutagenic modification and allow accurate transmission of genetic information (4). Unrepaired lesions or strand brakes left in DNA might be the result of dysfunction in DNA repair, and lead to aging, carcinogenesis or neurodegeneration (5,6). Some pathological disorders are directly related to defects in DNA repair, telomere maintenance or DNA damage response machinery (7–9). At the same time, random changes in DNA are viewed as a main source of genetic variability (e.g. the antibody production), and thus a driving force for evolution. A precise coordination of the genome networks is crucial to ensure that the correct genetic code is maintained within the genome.  

Traditionally, most of the known information on the DNA study, DNA damage, diseases and drug targets has been resisted in books, journals and databases. Moreover, research in molecular biology has been focused on single problems, simplified to the maximal extend. Recently, the holistic approach to research, referred to as the systems biology, has gained importance and interest in the scientific community. Arising databases mainly contain information on the sequenced genomes, genes, proteins, RNAs, etc. Also, the depositaries of information on drugs, small molecules and chemicals are in common use. The topic of the DNA metabolism is covered by many computational resources. Metabolic pathway databases contain metabolic pathways from a wide variety of organisms (10–17). Those databases queried about ‘DNA metabolism’, ‘DNA replication’, ‘DNA repair’, ‘nucleic acid’ show several dozen answers. However, the chromatin maintenance network contains about 20 subpathways, depending on the organism [e.g. Escherichia coli cells lack of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair or Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway].  

In contrast to others, the open access DNAtraffic database is a richly annotated resource for systems biology of DNA research containing information on: (i) DNA metabolism (replication, transcription, DNA repair pathways, chromatin organization, histone modifications and the DNA damage response network in eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms); (ii) proteins enrolled in widely understanding the DNA metabolism; (iii) DNA damage (damage type, damage source and damage effect); (iv) diseases related to the assembled human proteins and (v) drugs targeted on nucleic acids metabolism and proteins involved in the maintenance of genome stability.  

DNAtraffic database for systems biology of genome integrity is addressed to scientists, pharmacologists and students.  

# DETAILS RELATING TO DNAtraffic’s OVERALL DESIGN AND DATA STRUCTURE DEPICTION CONVENTIONS  

The aspects of the biochemistry and molecular biology of the genome dynamics during the cell life are the key for learning genome stability networks. During DNA replication, transcription and DNA repair, the cellular machineries performing these tasks need to gain access to the DNA that is packaged into chromatin or nucleoid. The main aim of the DNAtraffic database is to cover and elucidate the interdisciplinary knowledge linking all aspects of the DNA integrity processes (e.g. chromatin dynamics, DNA replication, damage signaling and DNA repair), DNA damage and drugs interacting with DNA or proteins directly enrolled in DNA metabolism and connect all pieces together for the coordination of steps within a pathway or for crosstalk between different pathways. As transcription, recombination and DNA integrity are central components in the evolution of recent genome structures, and because replication, recombination and repair (3R) were fundamental prerequisites for the origin of life, all these topics are taken under analysis and serve as the cohesive force underlying this comprehensive DNA topic-focused database (18).  

# PathCARD  

We used KEGG (13) and Reactome (12) databases for data implementation about pathways and networks concerning DNA metabolism. Some data like prokaryotic SOS response and translesion synthesis (TLS) were directly added by our DNAtraffic team. All proteins are classified according to the orthology class, and next to the DNA integrity networks: chromatin organization and histone modifications, replication, damage checkpoint, DNA repair, modulation of nucleotide pools and so on (Table 1). It must be emphasized that all described processes are tightly connected to each other and they act in concert sharing some steps and/or proteins. Known functions of proteins are indicated in the curator comments section of each entry. A special emphasis is devoted to the function of that protein within DNA metabolism pathways but we also refer to alternative roles in other pathways. Additionally, all Gene Ontology terms associated to that protein are listed. The pathway in which a given protein is playing a role is also explored by linking from DNAtraffic to the pathways included in the KEGG and Reactome databases.  

# ProteinCARD  

According to the DNA metabolism network we used the UniProt (19), KEGG (13) and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases for protein data implementation into DNAtraffic database for eight model organisms commonly used for DNA study. We collected 2921 proteins, for example—582 for Homo sapiens, 277 for Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 91 for E. coli (as of 13 October 2011). Using direct access from DNAtraffic to protein all users can obtain unusual view of well-known proteins from model organisms but classified into the orthology classes. This innovation may be useful for the systems biology research and proper selection of the model organism for further study (Figure 1) of selected pathway. Amino acids and DNA sequences were downloaded from Ensemble. When available, links to the protein 3D structure in Protein Data Bank (PDB) were provided and 2D picture is visible in the single ProteinCARD entry. If annotated, possible physical interactions with other proteins were obtained through IntAct, STRING and other databases providing interacting protein pairs from small and large-scale experiments. Also, manual annotation work was needed to match the DNA damage or drug to appropriate protein and DNA structure. Also, the DNA metabolism-related proteins from the DNAtraffic database were classified by orthology into the functional (or predicted by orthology) activities such as DNA polymerase, DNA ligase, DNA glycosylase, DNA helicase, nuclease, etc. This action also needed manual annotation work. Using our knowledge and bioinformatics tools, in near future, protein will be classified into the structural families attending to the presence of characteristic domains, e.g. BRCA1, BARD1, BRCT and RING, etc (20,21). Each protein possesses its own ProteinCARD entry with a succinct description, reciprocal links to pathway(s), and if existing—to disease and DNA damage, and additional external links to NCBI, KEGG and UniProt databases. Moreover, from single ProteinCARD user can overview and access to the other proteins from the same orthology class. This information can be useful for the systemic study of DNA integrity.

# DiseaseCARD  

Disease is a condition, which arises in a living organism, animal or plant, when something malfunctions and impairs the normal operation of the organism. Developing an understanding of the factors that cause disease motivates most of biological research. Till now, DNAtraffic collects 121 diseases related to dysfunction in 77 proteins enrolled to the DNA networks. Data were implemented from OMIM (22) and KEGG databases (13) as well as directly from PubMed. This action needed manual annotation work. Each disease possesses its own DiseaseCARD entry with a succinct description, link to protein(s) and sometimes the picture of the symptoms. Reciprocal links to diseases are also available in each protein and pathway field (Figure 1).  

# DamageCARD  

As of 13 October 2011, we collected information about 146 different types of damage in the DNA. Many of them describe general classes of damage events such as methylation or oxidative damage, or single-strand breaks or base loss, which are independent of the local sequence. About 50 chemical compounds that cause DNA damage were connected to the appropriate types of damage. Each type of damage is described on its own DamageCARD entry that includes information about the potential source (e.g. spontaneous formation, intermediate in some DNA repair process, methylating agents, etc.), proteins that may recognize its presence in the DNA, keywords that facilitate analyzing its context and external links (if available) to: PubChem Compound (CID), PubChem Substance (SID), ChemSpider, KEGG Compound, ChEBI and ChEMBL. DNAtraffic database also displays the unique chemical structures of DNA lesions in 2D and provides atomic coordinates for download in the smiles, InChi and InChiKey format.  

# DrugCARD  

Till now, we collected information about over 181 different types of drugs interacting with DNA or proteins involved in nucleic acids metabolism. Data were implemented from DrugBank, T3DB, Therapeutic Target Database (TTD), KEGG Compounds databases (13,23–25). Each type of drug is described on its own DrugCARD entry that includes information about the potential application (e.g. anticancer treatment, DNA topoisomerase inhibitor and other), drug–protein or drug–DNA interaction and external links to DrugBank, KEGG Compound, PubChemCompound, PubChem Substance, ChemSpider, ChEBI, ChEMBL and TTD databases. DNAtraffic database also displays the unique chemical structures of drugs in 2D and provides atomic coordinates for download in the smiles, InChi and InChiKey format.  

# SCHEME OF THE DNAtraffic DATABASE ARCHITECTURE  

The unordered data are difficult to interpret and many of the connections are lost. The OWT ontology provides the clear view and discovers the new connections. DNAtraffic database has been implemented using the Django web framework (http://www.djangoproject.com/). It uses a PostgreSQL relational database to store data (http:// www.postgresql.org/). Scripts are written in Phyton language. DNAtraffic database is freely available and can be accessed at http://dnatraffic.ibb.waw.pl/ dnatraffic/.

# EXPANDED DATABASE LINKAGES  

Because DNAtraffic was designed to cover a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines, it must be extensively linked to many external databases. Until now, DNAtraffic contains up to 15 database hyperlinks including links to KEGG (13), UniProt (19), OMIM (22), PDB (26), PubChem (27), ChEBI (28), ChEMBL, GenBank (29), Pfam (30), GeneCards (31), GenAtlas (32), HGNC, PubMed, ChemSpider (33) and TTD (25).  

# CONCLUSION  

Researchers of the various chromatin structure and DNA repair processes have recently embraced approaches in which global measurements of gene expression and the proteome can be combined with genome-wide screening of sensitivity mutants to develop an integrated view of how cells respond to and protect themselves against DNA damaging agents. The emerging picture from these global genomic studies is quite different from the previous concept of DNA repair, cell cycle control and induction of apoptosis as being independent processes. In fact these processes appear to form a fully integrated network. Integration of these genome-wide measurements allows the development of specific models of response networks that could not have been detected or discerned previously.  

DNAtraffic database is the first platform for systems biology of DNA integrity during the cell life, and can be also integrally involved in translational research (18). This includes the identification of small molecule inhibitors of novel DNA damage response (DDR) pathways that put new light on the causes of cancer or have potential uses in treatment.  

DNAtraffic contains a significant number of data. As highlighted throughout this article, numerous improvements have been made in the quantity, quality, depth and organization of the information provided. DNAtraffic contains illustrated DNA networks in the cell, protein, damage and drug structures data and pictures. DNAtraffic also offers expanded database links. It is hoped that DNAtraffic will continue to develop to fulfil the needs of its users and provide an increasingly useful, information-rich DNA metabolism resource.

# ABSTRACT  

We describe the Biomolecule Stretching Data Base that has been recently set up at http://www.ifpan .edu.pl/BSDB/. It provides information about mechanostability of proteins. Its core is based on simulations of stretching of 17 134 proteins within a structure-based model. The primary information is about the heights of the maximal force peaks, the force–displacement patterns, and the sequencing of the contact-rupturing events. We also summarize the possible types of the mechanical clamps, i.e. the motifs which are responsible for a protein’s resistance to stretching.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Despite more than a decade of experiments on single biomolecule manipulation, mechanical properties of only several scores of proteins have been measured. A characteristic scale of the force of resistance to stretching, Fmax, has been found to range between ${\sim}10$ and $480\mathrm{pN}$ . The Biomolecule Stretching Data Base (BSDB) described here provides information about expected values of $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ for, currently, 17 134 proteins. The values and other characteristics of the unfolding process, including the nature of identified mechanical clamps, are available at http:// www.ifpan.edu.pl/BSDB/. They have been obtained through simulations within a structure-based model which correlates satisfactorily with the available experimental data on stretching. BSDB also lists experimental data and results of the existing all atom simulations. It is intended to be updated internally, through users input, and by making requests for needed calculations. The database offers a Protein-Data-Bank-wide guide to mechano-stability of proteins.  

Functioning of a biological cell involves conversion of chemical energy into conformational changes of proteins, nucleic acids and their complexes. Understanding of mechanical processes in the cell requires information about mechanical properties of the constituting biomolecules. One way to obtain it is through single-molecule manipulation such as stretching by a tip of an atomic force microscope (1,2). The scope of such studies is very limited compared to the number of the kinds of the molecules that are present in the cell. There is then a need to have estimates of mechanical parameters for a much larger set of molecules. These estimates are necessary to provide guidance when selecting targets for experimental studies and when making theoretical models.  

Recently, we have provided such estimates for 17 134 proteins (3) by performing molecular dynamics simulations within a coarse-grained, structure-based model. We have considered all proteins comprising up to 250 amino acids and having structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (4). The cutoff size well exceeds a typical single domain size which is of order 100–150 residues. This data set includes also proteins with knots of type $3_{1}$ and one slipknotted protein (5,6). Reference (3) presents a summary of the results and lists proteins with particularly large values of $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ . One of these proteins, scaffoldin c7A with the PDB structure code 1aoh, has been confirmed experimentally to be highly resistant to stretching. Its measured is equal to $480\mathrm{pN}$ (7). Here, we describe the Biomolecule Stretching Database (BSDB) in which results for all studied proteins are deposited. Initially, it is based on the results derived for ref. (3) but it is intended to grow. A synthetic discussion of the results is contained in (3). It includes presenting probability distributions of the values of $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ for the whole set and for various structural categories of proteins. In particular, it identifies categories which are likely to yield large forces. It also discusses the nature of possible mechanical clamps—structural regions which generate the most significant resistance to stretching. Usually, resistance arises through shear between parallel or antiparallel $\upbeta$ -strands (8–10). However, it should attain its top strength if formation of the cysteine slipknot motif is operational dynamically (3). This novel mechanism of strength has been discovered as a result of making the PDB-wide survey. It involves pulling a piece of the backbone through a cysteine knot as explained in the  

Discussion section where we also provide classification of all types of mechanical clamps found so far.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# The theoretical model used in the survey  

An input to structure-based models of proteins comes from the PDB. Such models are defined by requirement that the ground state of the system coincides with the native structure. They usually come with an implicit solvent and are coarse-grained. The simplest choice is to represent residues by $C^{\alpha}$ atoms. There is no unique prescription for a good structure-based model. A total of 62 possible variants have been analyzed in (11). Their mechanical and folding properties differ substantially. Several of them are optimal and we use the simplest of them as described in references (10,12–14).  

An attractive native contact between $C^{\alpha}$ atoms in residues $i$ and $j$ (at distance $r_{i j}$ is declared to arise if van der Waals spheres (enlarged to account for attraction) associated with the heavy atoms overlap (15). Non-native contacts are considered repulsive. In the first survey (10), all native contacts were included in the energy function. Here, we remove the i, $i+2$ contacts as they are usually dispersive and weak (16).  

The potential energy of the system of $N$ amino acids is given by $E_{\mathrm{p}}(r_{\mathrm{i}})=V^{\mathrm{BB}}{+}V^{\mathrm{NAT}}{+}V^{\mathrm{NON}}{+}V^{\mathrm{CHIR}}$ . The harmonic $\begin{array}{r}{V^{\mathrm{BB}}=\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\frac{1}{2}k\big(r_{i,i+1}-d_{0}\big)^{2}}\end{array}$ tethers consecutive beads at the equilibrium bond length and $k=100~\upvarepsilon/\mathring{\mathrm{A}}^{-2}$ , where e is defined below. A similar potential is used to describe the disulphide bonds. The native contacts are described by the Lennard-Jones potentials with the uniform energy parameter e:  

$$
V^{\mathrm{NAT}}=\sum_{i j}4\varepsilon\Bigg[\Bigg(\frac{\sigma_{i j}}{r_{i j}}\Bigg)^{12}-\Bigg(\frac{\sigma_{i j}}{r_{i j}}\Bigg)^{6}\Bigg]
$$  

The length parameters, $\upsigma_{\mathrm{ij}}$ , are selected so that the minima of the potentials agree with the native distances between the $C^{\alpha}$ atoms in the contact. $V^{\mathrm{NON}}$ , the potential in the non-native contacts, is similar to $V^{\mathrm{NON}}$ but it has purely repulsive terms.  

The model also contains a four-body chirality term that favors the native sense of chirality (17), a $\begin{array}{r}{V^{\mathrm{CHIR}}=\sum_{i=2}^{N-2}\frac{1}{2}-\upkappa\upvarepsilon\big(C_{i}-C_{i}^{\mathrm{NAT}}\big)^{2}}\end{array}$ where Ci ¼ ð!\~i1 3 !\~iÞ  !\~ þ1 and CiNAT is the chirality of residue $i$ in the native conformation and $\kappa=1$ . Here, $w_{i}=r_{i+1}-r_{i}$ . A positive $C_{\mathrm{i}}$ corresponds to right-handed chirality $V^{\mathrm{CHIR}}$ favors native values of the dihedral angles (11). The model considered here has similar properties (18) to the model with the 10–12 contact potentials of Clementi et al. (19).  

In our stretching simulations, both termini are attached to harmonic springs of elastic constant $k=0.12\upvarepsilon/\mathring\mathrm{A}$ . The choice of $k$ affects mostly the location of the force peaks. One end of the spring is pulled at a constant speed, $\nu_{\mathrm{{p}}}.$ , along the initial end-to-end position vector.  

We consider $\nu_{\mathrm{p}}=0.005\mathring{\mathrm{A}}/\tau$ , where $\tau$ is of order 1 ns since this is a characteristic time to cover a typical distance of $5\mathring\mathrm{A}$ through diffusion in the implicit solvent. The experimental results are obtained at various speeds that are all at least two orders of magnitude slower $(<10^{4}\mathrm{nm/s})$ . Using one speed for all proteins facilitates making comparisons. We monitor $F$ as a function of $d$ and record $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ .  

The value of e should be within $800{-}2300\mathrm{K}$ since it averages over of all non-covalent interactions in proteins. Our previous simulations of folding (13,20) were optimal with the dimensionless temperature $\Tilde{T}=k_{B}\Tilde{T}$ of order 0.3 which corresponds to room temperature if e is ${\sim}900\mathrm{K}$ ( $k_{\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is temperature). Our simulations are performed at $\tilde{T}=0.3$ . Our latest estimate of e is about $110\mathrm{pN}\mathring{\mathbf{A}}$ or 1.5 kcal/mole (3).  

Thermal fluctuations are introduced by random Gaussian forces together with a velocity dependent damping. This noise mimics the random effects of the solvent and provides thermostating. The equation of motion for each $C^{\alpha}$ reads $\mathrm{m}\ddot{\vec{\mathrm{r}}}=-\gamma\dot{\vec{\mathrm{r}}}+\vec{\mathrm{F}}_{\mathrm{c}}+\vec{T}$ where $F_{\mathrm{C}}$ is the net force due to the molecular potentials. The damping constant $\Gamma$ is taken to be equal to $2m/\uptau$ and the dispersion of the random forces is equal to $\sqrt{2\gamma k_{B}T}$ This choice of $\Gamma$ corresponds to a situation in which the inertial effects are negligible (13) but the damping action is not yet as strong as in water. Larger values of $\gamma$ have only a minor effect on the $F{-}d$ curves. The equations of motion are solved by a fifth order Gear predictor-corrector scheme (21). Due to the overdamping, our results are equivalent to those obtained by the Brownian dynamics algorithm (22). The $F{-}d$ curves are averaged over a pulling distance of $0.5\mathring\mathrm{A}$ .  

# Proteins with non-trivial topology  

The BSDB includes proteins with knots which were recognized by the KMT algorithm (23) as implemented in (24,25). These proteins were stretched to a maximal distance defined as the end-to-end distance along the backbone from which the sequential size of the maximally tightened knot (of order 12 residues for the trefoil knot) is subtracted. Currently, the BSDB does not include other types of knots since the corresponding proteins contain more than the cutoff value of 250 residues. BSDB includes one slip knotted protein which was recognized by the technique described in (26).  

# The force peak recognition  

An automated detection of $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ poses difficulties due to existence of fluctuations and a need to discard the final indefinite growth in $F$ when the resistance to pulling is provided only by the unbreakable couplings. There is no absolute prescription as to when it starts. The strongest proteins often give rise to isolated force peaks on such ‘final’ slopes. In our procedure, a trajectory is split into 100 parts in which we determine the maximum $F^{\mathrm{max}}(l)$ and time averaged $[F^{\mathrm{avg}}(l)]$ values of $F$ . The maximum arises in the $\vec{l^{\prime}}$ th partition provided $F^{\mathrm{avg}}(l)>F^{\mathrm{avg}}(l-1)>F^{\mathrm{avg}}(l)>F^{\mathrm{avg}}(l+1)$ . The value of  

$F_{\mathrm{max}}$ is then read off as $F^{\operatorname*{max}}(l)$ in this partition. Mistaken calls are due to large fluctuations in the final ascent and they occur with a probability of $\sim1\%$ . Thus peaks signaled as arising toward the end of the process are examined separately. If no isolated force peak is detected, $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ is declared to be 0.  

For each molecule, at least two trajectories have been studied to get a measure of errors. If the two trajectories are significantly distinct, the statistics is raised to 10 trajectories to identify various pathways (e.g. for 1qu0). The $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ specified in the data base is then given by the weighted average over the pathways. The experimentally studied 1aoh has small pieces of its contact map incomplete (due to missing locations of some atoms in the side chains). This contact map was completed (7) by calculating the $C^{\alpha}-C^{\alpha}$ distances in the affected regions and accepting distances smaller that $7.5\mathring\mathrm{A}$ as corresponding to the missing native contacts.  

# RESULTS  

# Stretching protocol  

The stretching protocol used in the survey involves anchoring one terminus to an immobile substrate and pulling another terminus by an elastic spring which moves at a constant speed. There is a huge number of other possibilities to choose pairs of amino acids as attachment points. Some of the available experimental data correspond to such non-terminal manipulation. This fact has been taken into account when comparing experimental to theoretical values of $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ to relate the effective unit of the calculated force to measurements. This unit is equal to $\upvarepsilon/\mathring\mathrm{A}$ , where the energy parameter e denotes the depth of the attractive potential well in native contacts between the $C^{\alpha}$ atoms. We estimate $\upvarepsilon/\mathring\mathrm{A}$ to be equal to $110\pm30\mathrm{pN}$ (3). The estimation procedure involves making extrapolations to the experimental pulling speeds used. The existing studies (9,27–32) indicate that it is only for protein GFP (33) that non-terminal pulling may result in a larger $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ than the terminal pulling. It is thus expected that the values of $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ provided by the BSDB are usually the upper bounds for the various choices of the manipulation. The data for non-terminal pulling can be calculated upon request.  

The BSDB also provides other information about stretching. In particular, it displays two calculated force, $F_{\mathrm{\bullet}}$ , versus displacement, $d.$ curves. If the two curves display noticeable differences then at least two distinct unfolding pathways are possible. The corresponding values of $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ usually do not differ much. Larger statistics of trajectories were obtained only for a small number of proteins. The $F{-}d$ curves can be used, for example, to identify mechanically stable intermediates along the unfolding pathway. These intermediates correspond to the force peaks and the associated conformations can be determined upon request. It has been shown (34) that such intermediates in FN-III are responsible for exposure of cryptic binding sites that allow for fibrillogenesis.  

The BSDB also presents findings obtained through literature search. Specifically, it lists available experimental data on $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ , together with the pulling speed used, and theoretical results that have been obtained by other methods, especially by all-atom simulations. It should be emphasized, however, that the literature data refer only to several tens of proteins.  

# Selection of structures from the PDB  

PDB entries include proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and their complexes. We have downloaded all 54 807 structures that were available on 17 December 2008 by establishing a local mirror of the ftp://ftp.rcsb. $\mathrm{org/pdb/}$ site and utilizing GNU wget program with an option preserving the database tree structure. We have restricted the survey to proteins of not more than 250 amino acids. We have used a script that eliminates entries containing words like DNA DUPLEX, RIBOSYME, OLIGONUCLEOTIDE, etc. in their HEADER and TITLE sections. Other keywords are detailed in the Database description presented online. However, special attention has been paid to files containing keywords like DNA as they may still refer to proteins, like the DNA ribonuclease.  

Despite the thorough validation of structures in the PDB, not all structure files are readily available for molecular dynamics simulations, as they may have either missing residues or insufficiently resolved segments. Generally, such gap containing structures have been eliminated from our studies. We have also rejected structures in which some distances between consecutive $C^{\alpha}$ atoms are outside of the (3.6–3.95) A range. This rule does not apply if one of the amino acids is proline as the corresponding distances fall then in the range (2.8–3.85) ˚A. In case of proteins that occur in multimeric or multi-protein complexes, we examine only the first chain and neglect any disulphide bridges to other units. We do not eliminate structures with artificial or modified amino acids. If there are multiple structures assigned to a protein (especially for structures determined through NMR), we take the first one. If there are alternative local placements, we take the first one if the distances between the $C^{\alpha}$ atoms are proper, otherwise we try the alternative. However, we reject files with ambiguous definitions of alternative local placements.  

The disulfide bonds in our model cannot break and thus behave differently than contacts due to hydrogen bonds or ionic bridges. We detect such bonds using the information contained in the ‘SSBOND’ section of the PDB file.  

# Databases used in BSDB  

The BSDB relates to four external databases: PDB (4), CATH (35), SCOP (36) and Gene Ontology database (37). The first of these is the source of structures for which the calculations were made. The next two assign a symbol of structure classification to a protein. The assignment based on CATH is algorithmic whereas the one on SCOP relies on human judgment. The fourth database provides description of biological function. The very strongest protein is currently predicted to be the extracellular bone morphogenic protein 1 bmp for which $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ could be around $1\mathrm{nN}$ Its mechanical clamp is that of the cysteine slipknot. It should be noted that there is a website, www.p-found.org, which allows for making and depositing all-atom simulation of protein stretching (38).  

The Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) (36), accessible at http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop, is a hierarchical scheme that classifies proteins according to features that relate to both structural and sequential features. The scheme is accessible either by name of a hierarchical level (Domain, Family, etc.), or it’s ascension number (39) in the form of [a–k].xx.yy.zz where a–k stands for class of proteins, and xx, yy, zz for lower levels of hierarchy. The numbers are not immutable and change between releases of the SCOP, thus they are presented along with the corresponding names.  

The Class, Architecture, Topology, Homology (CATH) (35,14) scheme is also hierarchical, but it considers four classes $(\alpha,\ \beta,\ \alpha-\beta$ and no-structure). Each entry in our database is presented with the corresponding ascension number and name.  

One should note, that a given PDB code may come with none, one or more SCOP or CATH entries, since a protein may be unclassified or contain two or more domains. When studying correlations between the dynamics and structure, we use classified structures and take the first assignment. In the 1.73 version of SCOP (11), there are 92 972 entries that relate to 34 495 pdb structures. These entries are divided into 3464 families, 1777 superfamilies and 1086 unique folds. The 3.2 version of CATH contains 114 215 domains, 2178 homologous superfamilies and 1110-fold groups (12).  

# Information provided  

The structure-based data are presented in four lists: one ranked by the value of $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ , another by the number of amino acids in the structure, the remaining two by the structure classification codes that come with the CATH and SCOP schemes. One can also access the results by providing the PDB code of a protein. An example of data available for a given protein is shown in Figure 1 for the scaffoldin 1aoh. They start with the chain used, value of $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ in $\varepsilon/\mathring\mathrm{A}$ together with the corresponding standard deviation, $\Delta F_{\mathrm{max}}$ , based on several trajectories, and the value of $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ converted to $\mathrm{pN}$ . They also specify value of the tip displacement, $D_{m a x}$ , at which the maximal peak force arises for $\mathbf{\Delta}^{\mathbf{p}}_{p}=0.005\mathring\mathrm{A}/\tau$ , where $\tau$ is of order 1 ns, and the corresponding end-to-end distance, $L_{m a x}$ The force peak position is also described in terms of the dimensionless parameter $\lambda$ defined as $(L_{m a x}-L_{n})/$ $(L_{f}-L_{n})$ , where $L_{n}$ is the native end-to-end distance and $L_{f}$ is the full backbone length. Small values of $\lambda$ indicate that the force peak arises at the beginning of the pulling process. $L_{f}$ is close to the end-to-end distance at full extension only provided there are no disulphide bridges that require significantly larger forces to get ruptured. The number of the disulphide bridges is given by the parameter nSS. In this example, there are no such bridges.  

The entry also specifies the related structure codes and corresponding names, if available, and all GO numbers that specify molecular function, biological process, and cellular component. In addition, it shows examples of two stretching trajectories in the $F{-}d$ plots. Such plots indicate whether the force peaks are multiple or not. The arrow locates the displacement at which the biggest force maximum arises.  

A simultaneous display of data for several proteins is implemented through the ‘add this protein to compare’ hyperlink and then using ‘compare’. It allows for an analysis of data with a common characteristic such as the system size, the value of $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ or function. The $F{-}d$ curves for the selected proteins are displayed in a column, where they can be inspected visually. Results can be sorted according to various properties, for example by the CATH or SCOP number. In this way, the user can inspect changes in extension curves within the same family, or between proteins with relatively low homology, allowing one to correlate the peak pattern with a degree of relationship.  

An important feature of the BSDB is that it provides information about the microscopic nature of the unravelling process. It is contained in the so called scenario diagrams (14) which specify the pulling distances at which particular native contacts are seen as operational for the last time (i.e. distances between amino acids $i$ and $j$ do not exceed a threshold value). For each protein, the BSDB gives a listing of the breaking distances, $\scriptstyle d_{u}$ , for each native contact. A scenario diagram can be obtained if $|j-i|$ is plotted against $\boldsymbol{d}_{u}$ as in (14). We provide examples of such diagrams for 1aoh (one of the strongest proteins) and 1j85 (a protein with a knot).  

We provide hyperlinks to several other databases, such as CSU (16), that facilitate understanding of contacts and of identification of secondary structures to interpret the scenario diagrams.  

# DISCUSSION  

The information contained in the scenario diagrams can be used to determine the nature of the relevant mechanical clamp. Accumulation of rupture events around a specific value of $\boldsymbol{d}_{u}$ signifies occurrence of a force peak. Some of the rupture events belonging to a peak are crucial dynamically—removal of the corresponding contacts reduces $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ significantly. Such contacts identify the mechanical clamp. The remaining rupture events are just concurrent. It is hard to identify the mechanical clamps in an automated way since one needs to determine structurally relevant groups of contacts and then redo the simulation with various groups removed. We have accomplished this task for selected proteins, including the 64 strongest (results are listed in BSDB). Taking it together with discussions in the literature we can identify typical motifs which are associated with mechanical clamps. We divide these motifs into two groups: (i) involving strain in localized regions and (ii) involving a larger motion of a loop or two loops that are made of segments of the backbone.  

Figure 2 shows examples of mechanical clamps belonging to the first group. The $\upbeta$ -strands are indicated as black arrows in the figure. The simplest motifs are denoted by S,

SA and Z. The first of these corresponds to shearing between parallel $\upbeta$ -strands, similar to what takes place in a stretched titin (8,9). The longer the strand, the bigger the number of bonds that are sheared simultaneously and then the bigger the value of $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ . It should be noted that $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ is also affected by the direction of the stretching force relative to the orientation of the clamp. The second of these corresponds to shearing between antiparallel strands (10). For a given length of the strand, SA yields a smaller $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ than S. The third motif is a zipper (40) which is the most fragile of them all since the contacts get ruptured one at a time. The elementary motifs S and $\mathbf{Z}$ can also arise with helices (in which case the arrows in Figure 2 would represent helices) but the corresponding values of $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ then are expected to be smaller than for the $\upbeta$ strands of a similar length. Another possibility is U—an unstructured clamp seen in 1qp1 and 1tum (10). It is similar to S except that two nearby $\upbeta$ -strands are replaced by unstructured segments of the backbone (non-typical strands).  

The elementary motifs S and SA can combine to form shear composite motifs shown in the middle line of the panels in Figure 2. Examples of these include disconnected shear motifs SD1 and SD2 and a supported shear motif  

![](images/778f8a20090aee269b2974429a659779ef7255221693e64258d06c8bac93f614.jpg)  
Figure 2. Mechanical clamps involving shear or zipping in localized regions. Except for the zipper motif, all other motifs involve shear between secondary structures. The black arrows indicate $\upbeta$ -strands. More generically, however, they may also depict $\mathfrak{a}$ -helices. The lighter arrows indicate the sense of motion that is induced by pulling. The ‘delocalized’ clamp consists of multiple local shearing regions. Unlike the motifs shown in Figure 3, its operation does not rely on motion of any backbone loops. This is the reason why motif $\mathbf{D}$ is lamped together with the clamps displayed in the current Figure 3.  

SS. In SD1, discussed in (10) and observed in 1aoh (7), one S motif is followed by another S motif, separated by an essentially shear free region. SD2 is similar but it involves two SA motifs in a row. The panel illustrating SD2 is drawn in a particular fashion that indicates the geometry of fibronectin (8) in a schematic way. For this protein, the constituting SA motifs correspond to the $\upbeta$ -hairpin. The SD2 motif is also found in proteins L and G (41). One can also consider a variant, SD3, in which $\mathbf{S}$ is combined with SA. It arises in GPF when pulled by residues 3 and 212 (33).  

In SS characterizing 1cp4 (10), the main S motif is flanked by neighboring $\upbeta$ -strands which stabilize it. Shearing the main $\mathbf{S}$ results also in a shear with the flanking $\upbeta$ -strands. We have found a few examples of still other possibilities in group I. One of them is SB—a shear box in protein 1pav as discussed in (10). It involves a sheared two-strand $\upbeta$ -sheet that is placed below a sheared two-helix ‘sheet’ so that a shear in one strand induces a shear on the helix above (not shown). Still another possibility is D—a delocalized clamp with multiple elementary clamps exerting comparable resistances to pulling. This happens, e.g. in 1lsl. Its schematic representation shown at the bottom of Figure 2 indicates that some of the contributing strands may be unstructured.  

Figure 2 shows one more shearing motif denoted by T for torsion. It has been argued to be operational in polyankyrin (42). It combines shear in multiple S-like motifs with undoing of the overall horseshoe shape of the protein. This shape seems to result from a combination of steric stiffness and some contacts in the loop-like linkers. The reported experimental value of $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ for 12 domains is larger than that of 1aoh (42), however for six domains is much smaller $(\sim50\pm20\mathrm{pN})$ ) (43). Our simulations for 12 and 3 domains have yielded $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ of only of order 140 and $60\mathrm{pN}$ respectively (J.I. Sulkowska, unpublished data). A small force for a single domain has been also derived through all-atom simulations (44) [see also ref. (45)].  

Figure 3 illustrates another category of mechanical clamps belonging to the second group in which topological loops matter. In four of these, CK, CL1, CL2 and CSK, the loops arise due to the presence of between one and three relevant disulphide bonds (indicated by short solid lines) between pairs of cysteines. The cysteine knot, CK, corresponds to shearing taking place inside a cysteine knot (3)—a loop that is created by two disulphide bonds.  

CL1 and CL2 are cysteine loops. In CL1 shearing results because one branch of $\S$ is pulled by a cysteine loop (3). CL2 is similar but the motion of the cysteine loop also drags another piece of the backbone that transmits shear to the other branch of the S motif (3). CSK is the cysteine slipknot motif (3), it involves three disulfide bridges which generate two loops: knot-loop (which is an example of a cysteine knot) and a slip-loop. The mechanical resistance to pulling comes from pulling the slip-loop through the knot-loop. The fifth motif shown in Figure 3 is SK—the slipknot motif (26) that is observed, for instance, in protein 2j85. It is created by two interacting loops, the slip-loop and the knot-loop, that move simultaneously on pulling. If the knot loops shrinks faster than the knot loop then the slipknot gets tightened temporarily and a ‘catch bond’ (46) is formed. This intermediate and metastable configuration eventually gets untied upon further stretching. The existence of such a metastable conformation where the slipknot is jammed (26) is responsible for lengthening of unravelling times at a higher velocity or force.

Figure 3. Types of the force clamps that involve backbone loops.  

When we rank order the proteins according to the value of $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ , as calculated in our model, and ask in what order particular mechanical clamps are seen for the first time on reducing $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ , then their strengths can be rank ordered in the following succession: CSK, SS, SK, S, SD1, CL1, CL2, SD2 and $\mathbf{Z}$ . However, the strengths of various types of clamps intermix when going down the ranking ladder because they are influenced by dynamical details such as the length of a strand. In the case of CSK and SK, $F_{\mathrm{max}}$ depends on the relationship between sizes of the cysteine- and knot-loops in a strong way.  

We plan to expand and improve the database. In particular, we intend to implement a possibility of self-submitted calculations for desired pulling directions and speeds. Currently, the requests for data should be sent to bsdb $\textcircled{2}$ ifpan.edu.pl. In particular a structure file which is not in the PDB can also be submitted. The resulting data are added to the database (which may affect ranking of the proteins).

# ABSTRACT  

Ever since the breakout of COVID-19 disease, ceaseless genomic research to inspect the epidemiology and evolution of the pathogen has been undertaken globally. Large scale viral genome sequencing and analysis have uncovered the functional impact of numerous genetic variants in disease pathogenesis and transmission. Emerging evidence of mutations in spike protein domains escaping antibody neutralization is reported. We have built a database with precise collation of manually curated variants in SARSCoV-2 from literature with potential escape mechanisms from a range of neutralizing antibodies. This comprehensive repository encompasses a total of 5258 variants accounting for 2068 unique variants tested against 230 antibodies, patient convalescent plasma and vaccine breakthrough events. This resource enables the user to gain access to an extensive annotation of SARS-CoV-2 escape variants which would contribute to exploring and understanding the underlying mechanisms of immune response against the pathogen. The resource is available at http://clingen.igib.res.in/esc/.

# INTRODUCTION  

Genomic approaches have been instrumental in understanding the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for the COVID-19 pandemic (1). Availability of the genome sequence of one of the earliest SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Wuhan province (2) and high throughput approaches to resequence and analyse viral genomes have facilitated the availability of numerous open genomic data sharing initiatives by the researchers worldwide. Pioneering public sources like GenBank (3) and Global Initiative on Sharing all Influenza Data (GISAID) (4) provide access to systematically organized genomes of SARS-CoV-2. The China National GeneBank DataBase (CNGBdb) (5), Genome Warehouse (GWH) (6) and Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR) (7) are few other resources which provide access to viral genomes and perform analyses on phylogeny, sequence similarity and genomic variants.  

There has been a significant interest in recent times in understanding the functional impact of genetic variants in SARS-CoV-2 apart from exploring the genetic epidemiology. The variant D614G present in spike protein has been one the earliest and prominent examples with potential implications associated with the infectivity of the virus (8). Studies explaining the possible impact of SARSCoV-2 variants in diagnostic primers and probes have augmented the importance of analysing the variations and their underlying role in disease pathogenesis (9). Various resources have been made available to help comprehend the virus better and also to understand its evolution. Public sources exclusively documenting functionally relevant SARS-CoV-2 variants based on literature evidence are also available (10).  

With the advent of therapies including monoclonal antibodies, convalescent plasma as well as the recent availability of vaccines, interest in genetic variants which could affect the efficacy of such modalities of therapy has accelerated. The targeting of spike proteins by broad-neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 offers a potential means of treating and preventing further infections of COVID-19 (11). Evidence on immunodominant epitopes with significantly higher response rates have also been reported (12). Antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 is one of the key immune responses which is actively being pursued to develop therapeutic strategies as well as vaccines (13). The recent months have seen enormous research into the structural and molecular architecture of the interactions between the spike protein in SARS-CoV-2 and antibodies. Studies have also provided insights into the genetic variants which could confer partial or complete resistance to antibodies (14) as well as panels of convalescent plasma. With vaccines being widely available, the evidence on the effect of genetic variants on efficacy of vaccines is also emerging (15)  

The lack of a systematic effort to compile genetic variants in SARS-CoV-2 associated with immune escape motivated us to compile the information in a relevant, searchable and accessible format. Towards this goal, we systematically evaluated publications for evidence on immune escape associated with genetic variants in SARS-CoV-2 and created a database named as ESC. User-friendly web interface is made available to retrieve information on immune escape variants as well as their extensive functional annotations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first most comprehensive resource for immune escape variants for SARS-CoV-2. The resource can be accessed online at http://clingen.igib.res.in/esc/.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Data and search strategy  

Genetic variants in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and evidence suggesting association with immune escape were systematically catalogued. A significant number of variants were associated with escape or resistance to a range of neutralizing and monoclonal antibodies, while a subset was associated with resistance to convalescent plasma. The data was compiled by manual curation of literature available from peerreviewed publications and preprints. Literature reports with relevant information on antibody escape variants were retrieved from sources including PubMed, LitCovid, Google Scholar and preprint servers. The reports were systematically checked for details pertaining to the variation, antibodies tested and experimental methods followed in the study. In addition, the variants were systematically categorized based on experimental validation and computational prediction. Collated data was organized in a pre-formatted template based on their protein positions. This comprehensive compendium was used for further functional annotations.  

# Variant information and annotations  

The variant information and annotations were retrieved from annotation tables for individual features using ANNOVAR (16). Variant annotations broadly included genic features like the variant type and functional annotations related to deleteriousness and evolutionary conservation. Information on protein domains and immune epitopes was compiled and customized from various public sources. Variant sites reported to be potentially problematic including homoplasic regions, sites with recurrent sequencing errors and hypermutable sites were also labelled to enable quality check of the mutation site. Variants mapping back to sites of potential SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic primers/probes were also annotated.  

# Compilation of B-cell and T-cell epitope data  

Details on B-cell and T-cell epitopes spanning the protein residues of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) (17). All epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 (IEDB ID: 2697049) against human hosts with reported positive or negative assays and any type of MHC restriction were used for analysis. Epitope information pertaining to each amino acid residue including the epitope type (linear/discontinuous), epitope sequence with corresponding start and end positions and IEDB identifiers were systematically mapped back and documented.  

# Antibody details and annotation  

Information pertaining to the list of antibodies associated with escape mechanisms was retrieved from available public sources. Compiled antibodies were systematically mapped back to the AntiBodies Chemically Defined (ABCD) database which provides integrated information regarding the antibodies along with its corresponding antigens and protein cross links to fetch unique antibody identifiers (18,19).  

# Database and web interface  

The back-end of the web interface was implemented using Apache web server and MongoDB v3.4.10 in order to provide a user-friendly interface for variant search. The JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file format was used to systematically store the data. PHP 7.0, AngularJS, HTML, Bootstrap 4 and CSS were used to code the web interface for querying. Highcharts javascript library was also used for improved presentation and interactivity. A Beacon API has been created using the PHP programming language. The ESC Beacon API v1.0.0 is a read-only API with specifications written in OpenAPI. It uses JSON in requests and responses and standard HTTPS for information transfer. The

Figure 1. Illustration of mutation: antibody associations along the spike protein residues. Number of unique antibodies associated with potential immune evasion at each spike protein residue is marked along with domain annotations.  

Beacon API has one endpoint: /beacon?Variant; query interface is provided by the beacon endpoint. Contents of the database gets updated every month by systematic literature curations and also made available to users for bulk download.  

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  

# Repository of SARS-CoV-2 escape variants  

We compiled a total of 5258 variant entries from over 60 articles which studied SARS-CoV-2 variants and their effect on immune escape. This included a total of 2068 unique variants mapping to spike protein, ORF1ab and ORF3a. Out of the total unique variants, 2060 variants mapped to the gene coding for spike protein with potential immune escape mechanisms elucidated through experimental evidence as well as computational predictions. The remaining eight variants were found in ORF1ab and ORF3a genes, out of which, three were reported to confer potential epitope loss. The compiled list of variants was found associated with 230 unique SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and patient polyclonal sera. A handful of SARS-CoV-2 variations associated with vaccine breakthrough events have also been documented. A brief comparison of the curations in the ESC database with other publicly available resources is summarized in Supplementary Figure S1 and Supplementary Table S1a and b. Functional consequences of the variants were mapped from a total of 22 unique custom generated annotation datasets precisely including deleteriousness and conservation score predictions, protein domains and immune epitopes using ANNOVAR. The data features used in the study are summarised in Supplementary Table S2.  

# Antibody association mapping  

By scanning through the spike protein residues and their associations with SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing and monoclonal antibodies, we were able to compile the exact count of antibodies reported to have potential associations with the residues. From our analysis we observed that spike protein residues ranging from 350 to 500 amino acid positions exhibited potential antibody associations with the possibility of immune escape against at least one antibody. A total of 22 hotspot residues (140, 144, 246, 248, 346, 417, 439, 444, 445, 446, 450, 452, 453, 455, 475, 477, 484, 485, 486, 490, 493, 501) were found to possess immune evasion capability against $>10$ monoclonal antibodies. A schematic representation of the number of antibodies associated with spike protein residues along with their domain annotations is shown in Figure 1. The cumulative frequencies of spike mutation sites associated with immune escape against ${>}5$ mAbs in the receptor binding domain is shown in Figure 2. Systematic categorization of mutation residues along with their localization in spike protein is depicted in Figure 3.  

# Overview of B cell epitopes and immunodominant epitope regions  

With the aim of mapping back the known B and T cell epitopes encompassing the variant compendium, SARS-CoV2 epitope details were extracted. There were a total of 310 and 472 experimentally validated B cell and T cell epitopes respectively. This precisely included 263 linear and 47 discontinuous B cell epitopes in spike protein. Reported B cell and T cell epitope information was mapped back to residues possessing antibody escape mutations, which provided a brief insight on the potential impact of these variations in immune recognition and responses.

# Database features  

The database offers a user-friendly interface enabling the users to search for variants based on their amino acid change, gene name or the antibody name as per the specified format. The search query returns a list of matching results, whose complete functional annotations can be viewed by clicking on the displayed elements. The resource provides a list of annotation features for each variant precisely organized into eight major sections namely Variant details, Antibody details, Variants of Concern/Interest, Protein domain details, Epitope details, Functional annotation, Literature Evidence and Variant frequency. Figure 4A and B portrays the query search and the result display section of the resource.  

Basic details pertaining to the variant like the amino acid change, genomic coordinates and the variant type have been enlisted in the Variant details section. Information on the associated neutralizing antibodies and their identifiers are provided in the Antibody details section. Domain and epitope details section exclusively comprises details on the protein domain, epitopes reported to span the protein residue through experimental validations. Computationally predicted functional annotations on deleteriousness from SIFT (20), evolutionary conservation scores provided by PhastCons (21), GERP (22) and PhyloP (23) are included in the Functional annotation section. This section also enlists protein domain information retrieved from UniProt and immune epitopes documented from IEDB (17,24), UCSC and predictions from different software packages (B cells- BepiPred 2.0, CD4-IEDB Tepitool, CD8- NetMHCpan4). Annotations of potential error prone sites including sites of sequencing errors, homoplasic and hypermutable regions (https://virological.org/t/issues-with-sarscov-2-sequencing-data/473) and diagnostic primer/probe sites are also mapped. Extensive evidence from literature curation including the methods of the study, neutralization quantification profiles and details of antibody/mutant generation are summarized in the literature evidence section. Variant frequency section exclusively summarizes the estimated frequencies of the variant on a global scale as well as by its geography. In addition, characteristic mutations of VoCs and VoIs have also been annotated with brief descriptions in the Variants of Concern/Interest section.  

# CONCLUSIONS  

With evidence emerging on genetic variants in SARS-CoV2 associated with resistance to monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma using in-vitro assays, unique insights into the structural and functional mechanisms whereby the pathogen could evolve and evade antibodies have become possible. These insights could have enormous implications in efficacy of vaccines currently being used as well as under trials. One of the recent studies has reported the impact of a few immune escape variants on the efficacy of vaccines (25). It is expected that similar studies would be extended for a wider number of variants as well as vaccines. In order to keep pace with rapid discoveries regarding SARS-CoV2 escape variations and mechanisms, the database and the associated Github repository is being updated every month from peer reviewed publications and pre-print articles with complete annotations. We therefore foresee that the ESC resource would be a central resource to enable such studies and provide a ready reference to the emerging evidence on immune escape.

# Abstract  

Rhinovirus (RV), a prominent causative agent of both upper and lower respiratory diseases, ranks among the most prevalent human respiratory viruses. RV infections are associated with various illnesses, including colds, asthma exacerbations, croup and pneumonia, imposing significant and extended societal burdens. Characterized by a high mutation ate and genomic diversity, RV displays a diverse serological andscape, encompassing a otal of 174 serotypes dentified o date. Understanding RV genetic diversity s crucial or epidemiological surveillance and nvestigation of espiratory diseases. This study ntroduces a comprehensive and high-quality RV data esource, designated RVdb http://rvdb.mgc.ac.cn , covering 26 909 currently dentified RV strains, along with RV-related sequences, 3D protein structures and publications. Furthermore, his esource features a suite of web-based utilities optimized or easy browsing and searching, as well as automatic sequence annotation, multiple sequence alignment (MSA), phylogenetic tree construction, RVdb BLAST and a serotyping pipeline. Equipped with a user-friendly interface and integrated online bioinformatics tools, RVdb provides a convenient and powerful platform on which to analyse the genetic characteristics of RVs. Additionally, RVdb also supports the efforts of virologists and epidemiologists to monitor and trace both existing and emerging RV-related infectious conditions in a public health context.

# Introduction  

Rhinovirus (RV), which belongs to the family Picornaviridae and the genus Enterovirus  s a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus with a genome size of approximately 7200 bp. t s classified nto hree species: RVA, RVB and RVC.  

The viral genome contains a single coding sequence (CDS) that is translated into several proteins through cleavage by virally encoded proteases. These proteins include four capsid proteins and seven non-structural proteins. The RV capsid is formed by the assembly of 60 copies of each of the four capsid proteins (1 . RV, the most frequently detected respiratory virus, s responsible or one-half o wo-thirds of common colds and one-half of the exacerbations of asthma (2–5 . It has been reported hat RV nfection can also cause bronchiolitis, croup, community-acquired pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, aggravation of chronic lung diseases and other lower respiratory tract infections $(6-$ 12 . RV imposes a significant economic burden, encompassing costs associated with medical treatment, educational disruptions, work absenteeism and hindrances to social progress (13–16 .  

The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), illuminated the potent dangers associated with respiratory RNA viruses (17 . Notably, RV exhibits resemblances to SARS-CoV-2 in aspects such as its extensive presence and prevalence within the human population along with high mutation rates. Since its discovery in the 1950s (18 , RV has been reported in 58 countries according to RVdb. In the United States, children experience an average of two RV infections per year, while adults typically have one. Furthermore, RVs display a marked level of serotypic diversity. At present, there are 174 identified serotypes, 81 types of species RVA, 33 types of species RVB and 60 types of species RVC. The existence of serotype diversity imposes intricate challenges, from precise typing information and typing annotation to the development of cross-protective therapeutics and vaccines (19 20 . This confluence of difficulties provides a compelling rationale for directing attention towards RVs as a subject of significant consideration.  

Given the extensive utilization of molecular methodologies in the field of virus identification and functional analyses, the comprehensive retrieval of viral sequences, coupled with associated annotation/meta-information, assumes a pivotal role in acilitating n-depth nvestigations nto he genetic diversity of RVs. However, through our examination of public data, we have observed several issues in RV-related data, including a considerable number of sequences, insufficient metainformation, absence of genomic annotations and inaccuracies or incompleteness in the categorization of species and types, cumulatively constituting formidable barriers that hinder comprehension of the characteristics of RVs, similar to our previous studies on the curation of zoonotic and vectorborne viruses (21 . Furthermore, the establishment of interconnections with other important public data resources, such as PubMed, UniProt and PDB, remains notably restricted and inconvenient. Evidently, the challenges mentioned above collectively contribute to the intricate challenge faced by users seeking targeted insights pertaining to known RVs. In this study, we introduce a specialized RV database, designated RVdb (accessible at http://rvdb.mgc.ac.cn . With parallels to the Influenza Research Database (22  for influenza virus and HBVdb (23  for hepatitis B virus, RVdb focuses on the collection and curation of up-to-date knowledge on currently identified RVs. The well-integrated set of data types and analysis tools available on he RVdb platform are actively employed o enhance the comprehension of existing RV populations. Concurrently, these resources are anticipated to assist in the development of vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, mitigating the public health impact of respiratory diseases associated with RVs.  

# Data preparation and database implementation  

RVdb, as a sequence-centric database, is dedicated to providing up-to-date and comprehensive information associated with RVs. To retrieve all available sequences from the public domain, we conducted exhaustive searches in the PubMed, Taxonomy and Nucleotide databases (24  of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the keywords (‘Rhinovirus’ OR ‘RV’ OR ‘HRV’) AND (‘virus’ OR ‘viruses’). The associated GenBank records pertaining to RV within the aforementioned three databases were then downloaded and parsed via a Biopython script to generate humanread tables of the meta-information. Of the original GenBank records inspected, a substantial number of viral sequences, accompanied by preliminary metadata, have been deposited nto the GenBank database by submitters. Therein, ${>}83\%$ of the sequences lack necessary information regarding specific sampling locations/ imes, while $>53\%$ of the sequences are not linked to relevant literature (if it exists). To address the issue of naccuracies n submitted GenBank records, comprehensive searches were first conducted on mainstream search engines such as Google and Bing for GenBank records that lacked direct inks o pertinent iterature if available). These efforts enabled us to establish connections between the sequences and the related literature. Then, we performed meticulous crossreferencing of published records, proofreading for any inconsistencies or gaps in meta-information by carefully examining the details described in the related literature. All these curation processes were undertaken to assure dataset accuracy and comprehensiveness, thereby promoting subsequent analysis and interpretation related to RV. Furthermore, additional data types (e.g. protein sequences, 3D protein structures and RV-related publications) were urther collected rom GenPept, PDB (25  and PubMed. While molecular methods are predominantly employed for diagnosis and functional studies of viruses, numerous findings have relied on alternative approaches without sequencing (e.g. immunological methods). In addition to the sequence-related publications, our database includes $>20\ 000$ sequence-independent publications pertinent to RV research, hereby reinforcing associations between diverse data ypes and bolstering he comprehensiveness of he RVdb dataset. To facilitate users in efficiently and precisely retrieving individual publications, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) (26 27  are integrated into the publication retrieval and browsing features of RVdb (Figure 1A).  

The aforementioned data entries were refined with a controlled and consistent vocabulary and stored in a wellstructured MySQL database. The web service layer was executed by a set of Python scripts, employing the Flask framework (http://flask.pocoo.org/ . To augment the user experience and interactivity within the interface, we incorporated a suite of web programming libraries, utilizing the Bootstrap framework (https://getbootstrap.com/ , the crossplatform JavaScript library jQuery (http://jquery.com , the interactive charting library HighCharts (https://highcharts. com  and DataTables, a comprehensive JavaScript library equipped with a variety of plugins for grid data manipulation (https://www datatables.net . Additionally we also integrated a set of bioinformatic tools to facilitate online data analysis and visualization, such as an efficient JavaScript component for the visualization and analysis of multiple sequence alignment (MSA) data known as MSAViewer (28 , a cutting-edge web application or 3D visualization and analysis of substantial biomolecular structures known as $\mathrm{Mol}^{*}$ Viewer (29 , a reusable and open-source sequence feature viewer known as PDB ProtVista (https://github.com/PDBeurope/ protvista-pdb , a JavaScript library for the visualization of phylogenetic trees known as Archaeopteryx.js (https://github. com/cmzmasek/archaeopteryx-js  and an open-source project for a real-time view of the evolution and spread of RV known as Nextstrain (30 .

# Database content and features  

The RVdb datasets consists of five datasets: serotyping library, virus strain/sample meta-information, the available nucleotide/protein sequences of each virus, 3D protein structure and RV-related publications. Based on these datasets, RVdb offers a highly intuitive and responsive web platform (http://rvdb.mgc.ac.cn  or users o browse and search he upto-date aforementioned information about presently identified RVs (Figure 1B). Based on the genomic characterization and genetic diversity of RV, we further developed an automatic pipeline for MSA, phylogenetic tree construction and sequence annotation, ntegrated Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search and VP1- and VP4/2-based RV typing for the identification and characterization of novel RVs or associated variants.  

# Browse and search the database  

The primary utilities of the database, including datasets browsing and searching, real-time statistics, and a detailed help document, are accessible on the homepage by clickable icons, each providing direct access to the respective main page. Within the browsing and searching section, RVdb initially presents an introduction page designed to help users retrieve fundamental information about RV, encompassing genomic organization and genetic diversity. Users can further browse and search curated meta-information pertaining to viruses, sequences, and samples. This includes details, such as strain, species, sequence length and completeness, sampling data and location, and related literature (if available) (Figure 1C). RVdb also offers online browsing of RV 3D protein structures, along with a 1D protein feature viewer module that allows users to visualize annotation information for structural proteins (Figure 1D). The 3D protein structure data are cross-referenced to the serotyping information by integrating the annotated strain data. To provide an intuitive overview of the geographic trends in the available data, a global map is provided with colour-coded markers denoting the presence of known RVs (Figure 1B). Each section corresponding to a specific country provides a direct link to a panel showcasing detailed information regarding RVs identified within that country. This geographical context is invaluable to epidemiologists and public health researchers, facilitating the monitoring and source tracking of current respiratory diseases caused by RV. Furthermore, RVdb employs Nextstrain, a sophisticated phylogenetic visualization toolset, to describe of the spread and evolution patterns of RVA, RVB and RVC, respectively. This tool enables simultaneous exploration of phylogenetic and spatial/ emporal relationships, with different serotypes/countries represented through distinct colours (Figure 1E). Additionally, RVdb incorporates the standalone NCBI BLAST tool (31 , enabling users to perform sequence similarity searches against all available sequences. This integration encompasses a set of BLAST programs, including blastn, blastp, blastx, tblastn and tblastx (Figure 2 . Users have the flexibility to select the BLAST program most suitable for their specific analytical requirements. Utilizing a set of in-house Python scripts, a concise and legible profile, with statistics or serotype and geographic distribution, s presented within the BLAST result tab (Figure 1F). For comprehensive and detailed guidance on the utilization of the RVdb database, a step-by-step instructional resource is available in the accompanying help document.  

# Analysis utilities  

Genomic annotation, MSA and phylogenetic tree construction play a pivotal role in enabling users to investigate the genomic structure of viruses and to conduct in-depth viral relationship analyses. Genomic annotation constitutes tasks that must be completed prior to submitting sequences to public databases. Therefore, RVdb offers an automatic sequence annotation pipeline based on well-annotated prototype strains (Figures 1G and 2 . In addition to CDS, annotations for untranslated regions (UTRs) and mature peptides, such as 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C and 3D, are also provided if present. Users can submit a complete or draft RV genome sequence to obtain detailed annotation reports. Furthermore, given that some original GenBank records do not provide sufficient sequence annotations, we utilized this pipeline to reannotate all available strains within RVdb. With thorough validation, this pipeline demonstrated significant increases in the number of nucleotide sequence annotations from 32 727 to 92 312 and protein sequence annotations from 25681 to 65989. To provide improved visualization of the genomic organization, we also developed an interactive and user-friendly sequence viewer specifically designed for RV (Figure 1C and G) hat behaves similarly o seqviz and NCBI Sequence Viewer (32 . Second, MSA forms an essential first step in various sequence analysis methodologies, such as the investigation of phylogenetic relationships. Accordingly, RVdb provides an automatic MSA module, allowing users to upload and calculate private data and supporting online visualization of the results (Figures 1H and 2 . Based on the the phylogenetic pipeline, RVdb can auto-selects the best model and infer the phylogenetic tree via maximum likelihood. It also offers online visualization of the generated phylogenetic tree, with options to download associated files and export images (Figures 1  and 2 . Automated phylogenetic tree construction utilizes MAFFT for MSA (33 34 , trimAl software for the automatic removal of spurious sequences or poorly aligned regions (35 , and IQTREE2 for the construction of phylogenetic trees (36 .  

Serotyping of RV is significant for clinical identification, precise traceability and effective prevention and control measures. Using our up-to-date prototype strain dataset, we also build an automatic RV typing pipeline based on calculating the $p$ distance of VP1 between an untyped strain and prototype strains. Users need only submit the VP1 sequence to RVdb, after which the pipeline determines the RV species, aligns it with the corresponding prototype strains, calculates the $p$ distance and generates a detailed typing report (Figures 1J and 2 . Because of the revision of serotyping standards, ncorrect or incomplete typing information is available in the original GenBank records and publications. To address this issue, RVdb systematically performs serotype validation for all strains with VP1 sequences available over $90\%$ integrity. It urther provides ntuitive visualization o present validation specifics on individual strain information page (Figure 1C). Therein, the typing information for 716 RV strains, which were previously untyped, has been added to the dataset. Typing information for a total of 1847 RV strains have been verified as correct, while 337 errors have been rectified. Furthermore, this methodology has contributed to the identification of four previously unreported serotypes, B107, C58, C59 and C60, which are detailed in our previous work (37 .  

Furthermore, the VP4/2 segment of RV, which is approximately 435 nucleotides in length, is well conserved and easily amplified. This region can serve as a predictive marker for discerning RV species and ypes, offering an alternative means of type identification in epidemiological studies when VP1 sequences are either absent or display low completeness (38 . Consequently, RVdb also includes a typing module based on VP4/2 (Figure 2 . This module is designed to fulfil the requisites for RV type prediction or identification in epidemiological studies, particularly in scenarios where VP1 sequences exhibit suboptimal completeness. Since this region is not classified as an official mature peptide, t acks a corresponding annotation in GenBank. n contrast, RVdb includes comprehensive annotations specific to this region, providing an optional solution for types and species identification. Due to certain typing limitations for the VP4/2 region, including its shorter length, higher sequence conservation and possible divergence from VP1-based yping outcomes, we refrained rom conducting VP4/2-based serotype verification for RV strains in the database.  

# Discussion and future directions  

RVdb serves as an advanced and versatile platform, centralizing data resources crucial for current RV research. As of August 2023, a total of 26909 RV strains along with their respective sequences, meta-information, 3D protein structures and publications had been added. Within this framework, a set of analytical utilities, tailored exclusively for RV investigation, have been integrated. These utilities are designed to deliver essential data and functional support across multiple domains: RV-related identification, classification, characterization and epidemiological surveillance.

Despite our rigorous efforts in data collection and validation, it is imperative to acknowledge several potential limitations. First, he nclusion of all presently dentified RV records cannot be guaranteed hrough only he application of retrieval keywords. In specific cases, the possibility of overlooked RV strains is inevitable, owing to misclassification by the submitters or historical alterations in taxonomy Consequently we earnestly appreciate and encourage users to communicate with us regarding any sequences or literature that may have inadvertently evaded inclusion in the RVdb database. Second, RV-related meta-information, including the publication, benefits our understanding of viral characteristics and acts as a key foundation for linkage with other datasets. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that ${>}25\%$ of the RV strains documented in the database remain unpublished, lacking associated literature. Given this situation, we will continue trying to determine whether there is relevant literature available to address possible inconsistencies or gaps in the follow-up study. Third, he molecular typing standard for RVs relies on the genetic distances within he VP1 or VP4/2 region. This criterion, however, ails o maintain absolute consistency with he crossreactivity observed in serological experiments, exemplified by cases such as RVA29 and RVA44 (39 . Consequently, we recommend users exercise careful consideration when interpreting biological implications, given that computer-generated results invariably necessitate subsequent experimental validation for conclusive confirmation. Additionally, the necessity for sequence integrity and specific gene ragments complicates the serotyping of RV strains. As more RVs are identified and published, the focus will shift towards establishing more precise and efficient RV molecular typing standards and methodologies.  

Given the widespread presence of RV in the human population, it is plausible that numerous undiscovered novel strains or serotypes may exist within publicly available highthroughput sequencing (HTS) datasets. Future endeavours will include the development and implementation of a specialized RV identification pipeline tailored for HTS metadata analysis. This advancement will enable RVdb to thoroughly scan clinical metadata in the public domain while identifying new RV strains or serotypes, further aiding in the understanding of the prevalence and coexistence of RVs and thereby providing valuable insights into the impact of different RV strains or serotypes on human health. Additionally, various machine/deep-learning-based methods are now used in the classification of genes or pathogens. Compared to homology-based identification, alignment-independent deeplearning-based prediction could leverage large auxiliary data to provide new avenues for biological research on the classification of RV strains or serotypes (40 . Therefore, while providing in-depth analysis methodologies, we will continue to update existing datasets every two months to provide users with the most accurate information. Meanwhile, our research subject will be gradually expanded to provide genomic and clinical datasets of other significant human-related respiratory viruses, establishing a comprehensive global surveillance network for respiratory viruses for efficient prevention and control of future emerging respiratory diseases.

# ABSTRACT  

Mutations at the ligand binding sites (LBSs) can influence protein structure stability, binding affinity with small molecules, and drug resistance in cancer patients. Our recent analysis revealed that ligand binding residues had a significantly higher mutation rate than other parts of the protein. Here, we built mutLBSgeneDB (mutated Ligand Binding Site gene DataBase) available at http://zhaobioinfo. org/mutLBSgeneDB. We collected and curated over 2300 genes (mutLBSgenes) having ∼12 000 somatic mutations at $\sim10\ 000$ LBSs across 16 cancer types and selected 744 drug targetable genes (targetable mutLBSgenes) by incorporating kinases, transcription factors, pharmacological genes, and cancer driver genes. We analyzed LBS mutation information, differential gene expression network, drug response correlation with gene expression, and protein stability changes for all mutLBSgenes using integrated genetic, genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, network and functional information. We calculated and compared the binding affinities of 20 carefully selected genes with their drugs in wild type and mutant forms. mutLBSgeneDB provides a user-friendly web interface for searching and browsing through seven categories of annotations: Gene summary, Mutated information, Protein structure related information, Differential gene expression and gene-gene network, Phenotype information, Pharmacological information, and Conservation information. mutLBSgeneDB provides a useful resource for functional genomics, protein structure, drug and disease research communities.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Molecular recognition plays a fundamental role in all biological processes (1). Mutation-induced conformational change and induced fit with the ligand are the key factors of protein–ligand interactions in cancer cells (2,3). Point mutations at spatially distinct sites lead to conformational changes and exert hinge effects (4). Some point mutations at ligand binding sites may dramatically change the binding affinities of the ligands (5,6). Studies also reported that mutations at ligand binding sites could link to the resistance to small molecule drugs in patient care (7,8). Recently, we also found a significantly higher mutation rate at ligand binding residues than in other parts of the protein sequence across 16 cancer types (9). Therefore, comprehensive annotations of all ligand binding site mutations in pan-cancer will allow for investigators to better understand cancer mechanisms and identify targetable mutations at ligand binding sites.  

Many researchers have identified mutation-induced molecular modifications in ligand-protein interactions. For example, mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in glioblastoma increased ligand binding affinity for EGF (10). A point mutation in neuraminidase 1 gene (NEU proto-oncogene) conferred high ligand binding affinity (6). Moreover, a few studies reported the roles of ligand binding domain mutations. The association between the ligand binding sites and disease related mutations in the type I collagen was observed (11) and the ligand-bindingdomain mutations of androgen receptor $(A R)$ gene led to the disruption of interaction between $\mathrm{N}_{-}$ and C-terminal domains (12). Recently, several studies showed that ligand binding site mutations could lead to drug resistance. For example, ligand-binding domain mutations in estrogen receptor 1 gene (ESR1) were found in hormone-resistant breast cancer (7). Two major ligand binding site mutations in ESR1 can confer partial resistance to the currently available endocrine treatments (13). Consequently, the cancer and drug research community has recognized the importance of ligand binding site mutations and called for systematic and comprehensive analyses of genes with ligand binding site mutations (14), which are still largely not done yet despite the exponential growth of cancer and other biomedical data recently.  

This paper introduces mutLBSgeneDB (mutated Ligand Binding Site gene DataBase), the web interface, and its applications. As the first database encompassing all human ligand binding site mutations with bioinformatics analyses, it provides unique and useful information for functional genomics, protein structure, disease and drug research communities.  

# DATABASE OVERVIEW  

mutLBSgeneDB contains over 2300 genes with ligand binding site mutations that are annotated with seven categories (Figure 1). (i) Gene summary category provides basic gene information with diverse hyperlinks and the literature evidence in ligand binding site mutations for each gene. (ii) Ligand binding site mutation information category presents detailed information of somatic mutations that occur at the ligand binding sites only. The current version of mutLBSgeneDB includes 11 873 non-synonymous mutations at 10 108 ligand binding sites that were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (15) and a semi-manually curated database for biologically relevant ligand-protein interactions (BioLiP) (16). (iii) Protein structure related information category shows relative stability of proteins encoded by all mutLBSgenes and ligand binding affinity changes with their drugs after the occurrence of mutation at the ligand binding site of carefully selected 20 genes. (iv) Differential gene expression and gene-gene network category shows expressional differences between mutated and non-mutated samples based on co-expressed protein interaction network (CePIN). (v) Phenotype information category includes disease related information on the genetic and mutation level. (vi) Pharmacology information category provides heat map using the top 20 correlated drugs between mutLBSgene expressions and 138 anti-cancer drug responses across 790 cell-lines from Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) (17). mutLBSgeneDB shows the druggable features of mutLBSgenes covering a total of 1324 drugs from DrugBank. (vii) Conservation information category offers conserved sequences for each ligand binding site residue across eight species.  

Table 1 summarizes the statistics of 2372 genes having mutations at ligand binding sites (mutLBSgenes) and 744 drug targetable mutLBSgenes (targetable mutLBSgenes) for each annotation category. mutLBSgeneDB can be used to explore and predict cancerous features and possible drug repurposing. All aforementioned entries and annotation data are available for browsing and searching on the mutLBSgenes web site (http://zhaobioinfo.org/mutLBSgeneDB).  

# DATA INTEGRATION  

# mutLBSgenes and targetable mutLBSgenes  

A total of 145 531 ligand–protein binding interactions for 2874 proteins of UniProt (18) were downloaded from BioLiP (data version January 2016) (16). Somatic point mutation data was retrieved from TCGA (March 2016). Mutations that occur on the direct protein–ligand binding site residue or on its immediate two flanking residues at both upstream and downstream sides were considered to be ligand binding site mutations. There were 4660, 4472 and 2741 nsSNVs located at the direct protein–ligand binding site residues, the immediate flanking residues ( $\pm1$ aa), and the immediate second flanking residues ( $\pm2$ aa), respectively. After this data processing, 2372 genes with 11 873 non-synonymous mutations at 10 108 ligand binding sites were obtained. Furthermore, 744 drug targetable mutLBSgenes were identified by incorporating kinase genes from the Human Kinome (19), transcription factors from TRANSFAC (20), all drug target genes from the concise guide to pharmacology (IUPHAR, International Union of Basic and Clinical pharmacology) (21), and cancer driver genes from cancer type specific, significantly mutated genes that we collected and curated previously (22). As a result, the targetable mutLBSgenes are composed of 220 human kinases, 216 human transcription factors, 579 IUPHAR target genes, and 101 cancer-type specific significantly mutated genes (Supplementary Table S1). Ten common genes among the five gene sets were CREBBP, EP300, ESR1, EZH2, FGFR1, HDAC3, PGR, RXRA, SMARCA4 and SMO.  

# Manual curation of PubMed articles  

For the 744 targetable mutLBSgenes, a literature query of PubMed was performed in June 2016 using the search expression that applied to each mutLBSgene (using $B R A F$ as an example here: ‘((BRAF[Title/Abstract]) AND mutation[Title/Abstract]) AND ligand[Title/Abstract])’. The abstracts of over 1000 articles were manually reviewed. We found literature evidence (138 articles) for 98 genes $(\sim4.0\%)$ that support the role of these ligand binding site mutations in cancer or drug response. For the 301 genes annotated as kinase or cancer driver genes in mutLBSgenes, we added 3D structure images by searching the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (23). For the most recurrent mutation in each targetable mutLBSgene, we added related clinical information from genetically informed cancer medicine (My Cancer Genome) (24). Using this curation method, we created a classification system for the genes in the database to show reliability. Class A consists of genes with literature evidence and is part of the targetable mutLBSgenes. Class B consists of only targetable mutLBSgenes without additional evidence. The remaining genes belong to Class C.  

# Expression data preparation  

Gene expression data was downloaded from TCGA (January 2015). Normalized gene expression data from RNASeqV2 was extracted using the R package TCGAAssembler (25). In addition, microarray gene expression data from over 790 cancer cell lines was extracted from CCLE (October 2012).  

# Co-expressed protein interaction network (CePIN)  

The protein interaction network (PIN) reported in our previous study included 113 473 unique protein-protein interactions connecting 13 579 protein-coding genes (26,27). It was used in conjunction with the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) calculated for each gene-gene pair to build a CePIN. Co-expressed network figures were drawn using the igraph package in R (28). For each gene, the top 20 neighbor genes with the highest PCC values were kept in the network to reflect the genetic signals.

Figure 1. Overview of mutLBSgeneDB. mutLBSgeneDB is composed of seven annotation categories that cover the genotypic, transcriptomic, proteomic phenotypic, pharmacological data and network analyses of 2372 mutLBSgenes with manual curation of 744 targetable mutLBSgenes.  

# Gene-drug and gene-ligand interaction networks  

Drug–target interactions (DTIs) were extracted from DrugBank (29) and the duplicated DTI pairs were excluded. All drugs were grouped using Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system codes (30). Twodimensional chemical structure images of all drugs were generated using the chemical toolbox, OpenBabel (v2.3.1) (31). Ligand–target interactions (LTIs) were extracted from BioLiP and the duplicated LTI pairs were excluded.  

# Calculating drug binding affinity for top 20 ranked genes and their drugs  

We selected 20 genes ranked by the following information: recurrences in the samples, targeted by the drugs of ‘approved and investigational’ status from DrugBank, and number of mutated ligand binding sites. We further selected the most studied drugs (2 or 3) for each of these genes by searching DrugBank and PubMed and downloaded PDB structure file of drugs and proteins. Using these data sets, we searched the drug binding affinities for these 20 genes. We downloaded the crystal structures of genes and three-dimensional structures of drugs from PDB and a free database of commercially available compounds for virtual screening (ZINC) in mol2 format (32). Individual mol2 files were converted into pdbqt files using the python script prepare ligand4.py available in the Autodock Tools package (33). Using Autodock package, we computed the free energy and studied the docking. Lastly we searched the optimal fit of each drug into targets. The details about this method were described in previous studies (34,35).  

# Correlation between drug response and gene expression using CCLE data  

Drug response data in 714 cell lines on 142 drugs was extracted from Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (http://www.cancerrxgene.org/) (36) (October 2012). Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) between drug response and gene expression was calculated for each drug-gene pair.  

# Conservation information  

All sequences used in comparative alignment and specific positions of amino acid were downloaded from the Conserved Domain Database (CDD) of NCBI. Comparison of homologous sequences was obtained by using the multiple sequence alignment tool with high accuracy and high throughput (MUSCLE) (37).  

# Database architecture  

The mutLBSgeneDB system is based on a three-tier architecture: client, server, and database. It includes a userfriendly web interface, Perl’s DBI module, and MySQL

# WEB INTERFACE AND APPLICATIONS  

# Ligand binding site mutation information category  

This category presents detailed information of nonsynonymous mutations (i.e. nsSNVs) located at the ligand binding sites (Figure 2A) such as the lollipop-style plot showing the mutations that only occurred at the ligand binding sites, cancer type specific mutLBS table giving the sorted mutation frequency information across cancer types, and clinical information table showing the specific clinical information for the most frequently recurrent mutations. We obtained clinical information for 74 genes among 744 targetable mutLBSgenes using My Cancer Genome. For example, the most frequently observed nsSNV of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogenes homolog B1 (BRAF) is the $\mathrm{\DeltaV600E}$ driver mutation $(B\bar{R}A F^{\nu00E})$ , activates the MAPK pathway in $50\%$ of melanoma patients (38). This mutation is located near the ligand binding site (A598) (39). The cancer type specific mutLBS table shows the consistent results with the previous studies that the two most frequently mutated cancer types of $B R A F^{600E}$ are thyroid carcinoma (THCA) and skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) (40–42). Another example of ESR1 shows the possible usage of cancer type specific mutLBS table for user to examine whether and how the mutLBS present in different cancer types (43) (Supplementary Figure S1).  

To provide a weighted gene list, we sorted mutLBSgenes based on the number of mutated ligand binding site. Among the total 2372 mutLBSgenes, 1891 genes and 203 had more than two and ten ligand binding sites of mutation, respectively. Among these, the top 20 genes were ERGR, ABL, TP53, BCHE, CTNNB1, VHL, CSNK2A1, FOLH1, KRAS, THBS2, CD1D, F2, EP300, HGF, RUNX1T1, ABL1, AGO2, XDH, CD1B and CES1 (Supplementary Table S2). Gene set enrichment tests were performed for the 203 genes to infer the active pathways of mutLBSgenes (WebGestalt, adjusted $P$ -value (i.e. $q$ -value) $<0.05$ , hypergeometric test followed by multiple test correction using Benjamini–Hochberg’s method) (44). There were 40, 53 and 54 genes that were enriched in ‘negative regulation of cell death’ pathway, ‘response to endogenous stimulus’ pathway and ‘protein phosphorylation’ pathway with $q$ -value $2.80\times$ $10^{-15}$ , $3.58\ \times\ 10^{-16}$ and $6.35^{^{\circ}}\times10^{-\tilde{1}5}$ , respectively (Sup

plementary Table S3). From these pathways, we could infer that the top genes with the most ligand binding site mutations were significantly involved in tumorigenesis and phosphorylation.  

# Protein structure related information category  

This category shows protein stability changes after occurrence of mutation at the ligand binding site for all proteins encoded by mutLBSgenes (Figure 2B). One study comparing protein mean square deviation (MSD) between wild type and mutant proteins of B-Raf V600E showed that even a single mutation of the protein could lead to much different molecular characteristics (45). To this end, we calculated the relative stability of protein structure after one ligand binding site mutation using MuPro1.1, a computational tool that predicts the protein stability changes for singlesite mutation using support vector machines and neural networks (46). Our annotation results showed that five mutations (G466V, G466E, G466R, F468L and F595S) at three ligand binding sites of B-Raf may cause the change of protein structure toward a more stable form with a positive stability change value (Figure 2B).  

Furthermore, to annotate mutation-induced modifications on protein-drug binding, we selected top 20 genes ranked by recurrences, targeted by the drugs of ‘approved and investigational’ status, and number of mutated ligand binding sites. These genes are BRAF, CDK2, CPS1, CYP11B2, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C8, CYP3A4, EGFR, ERBB2, FGFR2, IDE, ITK, KEAP1, KIT, MET, RET, SULT1E1, VDR and $X D H.$ Binding affinity $\mathrm{(kcal/mol)}$ between wild type and mutant proteins with their respective drugs (Supplementary Table S4) was calculated for each of these genes. For example, mutated protein encoded by $B R A F^{V60\overline{{0}}E}$ has a lower free energy of binding to Vemurafenib, a FDA-approved BRAF kinase inhibitor in the treatment of melanoma, compared to other drugs such as Dabrafenib and Regorafenib (Figure 2B).  

# Differential gene expression and gene–gene network category Conservation information category  

This category provides differential gene expression and gene-gene network of mutated versus wild type samples to show expressional differences in each cancer type. First, a violin plot shows the differential gene expression between mutated and wild type samples for each mutLBSgene (Supplementary Figure S2A). Second, a co-expressed protein interaction network (CePIN) was created by calculating the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) using gene expression values from TCGA. Using this method, we found significantly different gene-gene networks of $B R A F$ between mutated and non-mutated samples in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD). Gene set enrichment analysis using CePIN gene elements of mutated samples showed that two coexpressed genes (BRAF and $P A K2$ ) enriched in ‘positive kinase activity’ pathway with $q$ -value 0.0116. In the wild type samples, 10 co-expressed genes were enriched in ‘regulation of defense response’ and ‘activation of immune response’ pathways with $q$ -value $9.86\times10^{-06}$ and $2.04\times10^{-05}$ , respectively (Supplementary Figure S2A, Supplementary Table S5). This result suggested that the occurrence of point mutation at the ligand binding sites of $B R A F$ in COAD may not activate the immune response; instead, protein kinases were activated for the tumorigenesis.  

# Phenotype information category  

This category includes two phenotype information tables. The first table shows the related disease information for each gene retrieved from a database of gene-disease associations (DisGeNet) (47). As shown in Supplementary Figure 2B, the most studied disease name for $B R A F$ is ‘Melanoma’ and less frequently studied diseases include ‘Colon cancer’, ‘Thyroid cancer’, and ‘Cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome’. This is consistent with the previous finding that BRAF mutations are present in approximately $50\%$ of melanoma, $60\%$ of thyroid, and $10\%$ of colorectal carcinomas and are less prevalent in other tumor types (48). On the other hand, the mutation-level pathogenic information table shows pathogenic mutation information from a public archive of relationships between sequence variation and human phenotype (ClinVar) (49).  

# Pharmacological information category  

This category provides pharmacological information such as the correlation between drug response and gene expression and the network visualization of genes with their interacting small molecules (Supplementary Figure S3A). Each gene expression profile in cell lines treated with anti-cancer drugs summarizes the correlation between drug response and altered gene expression by integrating microarray gene expression data from the CCLE database. For example, the expression of $B R A F$ was positively correlated with the treatment effect of drug NVP-TAE684. From the network and information table for the relating drugs and ligands of each mutLBSgene, user can retrieve more detailed information including drug structures. Overall, mutLBSgeneDB includes 1198 FDA-approved drugs targeting 961 mutLBSgenes (Supplementary Table S6).  

This category presents the homologous protein sequences of its flanking region for each ligand binding site obtained from MUSCLE to indicate if the ligand binding site is conserved among different species (Supplementary Figure S3B). For example, protein B-Raf has three mutated ligand binding sites: A481, A598, and C532, all of which are conserved in Homo sapiens (common name: human), Mus musculus (mouse), Gallus (chicken), Caenorhabditis elegans (roundworm), and Drosophila melanogaster (fly). In comparison, all ligand binding site mutations in human EGFR have shown conservation in mice, but not in chicken.  

# DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTION  

This study introduces a unique resource, mutLBSgeneDB, for the systematic annotation of genes having ligand binding site mutations. To serve functional genomics, protein structure, and drug research communities and advance precision medicine research, we will continuously update mutLBSgeneDB in the following directions. (i) Update routinely by checking the new data of mutations and ligand binding sites from TCGA and BioLiP. (ii) Collect highquality drug pharmacological data from high-throughput screening and drug resistance studies. (iii) Continue to collect articles on ligand binding site mutations. (iv) Add more protein-ligand 3D structures highlighting ligand binding site mutations with their drugs. (v) Collect and curate germline mutations at ligand binding sites and make the data interactive to somatic mutations. (vi) Perform additional integrative analysis by using other omics data such as methylation, microRNA, and proteomics data. mutLBSgeneDB will be useful for many investigators in functional genomics, protein structure, and drug and therapeutic research.

# Introduction  

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have substantially enriched our understanding of genetic variants linked to human traits and diseases. Nevertheless, a predominant number of these variants are found in non-coding regions, complicating the elucidation of their roles and the molecular pathways they influence (1 2 . The advancement of high-throughput technologies has significantly facilitated quantitative trait locus $(\mathrm{xQTL})$ analysis, establishing connections between functional variants and molecular phenotypes at diverse biological levels (3 4 , including gene expression (eQTL) (5 , chromatin accessibility (caQTL) (6 , histone modification (hQTL)  

(7  and DNA methylation (mQTL) (8 . These resources enhance our comprehensive understanding of the genetic architecture, revealing causal relationships and functional impacts of genetic variants across multidimensional biological levels.  

Large-scale xQTL studies such as GTEx (9 , BLUEPRINT (10  and PsychENCODE (11  have advanced our understanding of he downstream causal effects of genetic variants. However, analyses based on averaged signals from tissue samples may obscure the specific cellular contexts in which functional variants influence their associated molecular pathways. Recent advancements in cell-resolution analysis have substantially enhanced our understanding of how genetic variations influence molecular phenotypes within specific cellular contexts (12–16 . This progress reveals a complex interplay between genetic factors and cellular environments, crucial for unraveling the nuances of genetic regulation (17–21 . For instance, Natri et al  utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on lung issues rom pulmonary fibrosis patients and healthy controls, mapping eQTLs across 38 cell types, which revealed both shared and distinct cell-type-specific regulatory effects (22 . Nathan et al  explored the impact of genetic variations in memory T cells, demonstrating how cellular dynamics, including cytotoxicity and regulatory capacity, significantly influence these variations (19 . A pivotal direction for future genetic research is the precise characterization of the cellular contexts in which disease-associated variants modulate molecular phenotypes. This effort is essential for uncovering the molecular and cellular mechanisms contributing to disease susceptibility, deepening our understanding of the involved pathways, and facilitating the development of targeted therapeutic strategies (23–29 . scQTLbase (30  and SingleQ (31  are pioneering databases specifically dedicated to housing eQTL research based on scRNA-seq. scQTLbase includes cellular-dependent eQTL (cd-eQTL) resources from 17 distinct studies, while SingleQ maintains a collection of 15 scRNA-seq resources. n addition to single-cell sequencing technology, here are other strategies or discovering cd-eQTL. These strategies include using purified cell type omics data to map cellular-dependent $\mathbf{xQTL}$ (cd-xQTL) for understanding genetic regulation in homogeneous cell populations (32 33 , artificial intelligence models to detect cell type-specific regulatory effects (34 , and cell deconvolution techniques to examine the interaction between genotype and cell abundance (35 . Each of these strategies offers unique insights. However, current data resources do not comprehensively collect and organize cd-eQTL from these diverse approaches. Furthermore, the ack of cellular resolution genetic regulatory structure data at other molecular levels limits the depth and breadth of existing databases. These limitations highlight the urgent need for a comprehensive resource that not only systematically organizes cell resolution multi-omics genetic structures but also supports in-depth exploration and analysis.  

To address these issues and meet the growing demand for a comprehensive and integrated cellular-level genetic regulatory landscape database, we propose $\mathbf{xQTL}$ Atlas (xQTLatlas). xQTLatlas integrates 796 datasets from 151 cell types and 339 cell states across 55 human issues, covering $20\mathrm{xQTL}$ types. All cd-xQTL summary statistical datasets in xQTLatlas have been processed hrough standardized pipelines. These data enable researchers to systematically study the regulatory mechanisms of risk variants across multidimensional biological levels in various cellular contexts. xQTLatlas offers multilevel data exploration capabilities and unique nteractive visualization ools, enabling cross-cell ype, phenotype and genetic variants association analysis views. Additionally, xQTLatlas has significantly improved the user interface based on usercentered design principles, enhancing visibility and usability, and creating an environment conducive to intuitive data visualization and simplified queries. To our knowledge, xQTLatlas is the first comprehensive database to systematically organize multi-omics genetic structures of functional variants at the cellular level. We anticipate that xQTLatlas will become an invaluable resource for researchers, driving a deeper understanding of complex genetic regulatory mechanisms and promoting the development of precision medicine.  

# Materials and methods  

# Summary statistics collection and curation  

In constructing our comprehensive atlas, xQTLatlas, we meticulously implemented rigorous filtering criteria to ensure comprehensive and accurate content (Figure 1 . We began by conducting searches on NCBI PubMed and Google Scholar using predefined keywords and erms related o cell ype specificity and $\mathbf{xQTL}$ analysis to identify relevant studies. We integrated datasets from various cd-xQTL mapping strategies including cell sorting, single-cell sequencing, interaction analysis and computational discoveries to maintain data integrity. We included studies featuring cells from diverse biological backgrounds—normal, treated, diseased or other stimulated conditions—and rigorously selected data from published research articles, excluding hose acking essential details such as critical information on variants, traits or statistical measures. Due o he imited availability and ncomplete statistics of celllevel trans-xQTL data, trans-xQTLs are not included in the current version of xQTLatlas. All data are sourced rom repositories such as Zenodo https://zenodo.org/ , FigShare https:// figshare.com/ , GEO 36 , Synapse https://www.synapse.org/ and additional links provided in the original publications. xQTLatlas includes research from both genome-wide and regional cd-xQTL mapping, providing comprehensive coverage and ensuring that data can be traced back to the demographic information of the populations studied. We map these populations to categories defined in the 1000 Genomes Project (37 —AFR (African), AMR (Admixed American), EAS (East Asian), EUR (European) and SAS (South Asian), annotating datasets with multiple populations as ‘MIX.’ Given the variability of tissues, cell types/states and phenotypes in $\mathbf{xQTL}$ studies, we methodically categorized and annotated datasets from multiple sources. This methodical approach ensures that each cd-xQTL dataset can be precisely traced back to its original source, such as specific tissues, cell types or mapping strategies.  

For all genetic variants, we systematically remapped the chromosomal locations from the original publications to the Genome Reference Consortium Human Build 38 (GRCh38). When the coordinates were documented in GRCh37, we employed LiftOver (38  to transition these to GRCh38 coordinates. Simultaneously, we updated the original dbSNP ID to the dbSNP156 release (39 . Alleles for each cd- $\mathbf{\sigma}_{\mathbf{X}}\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{T}\mathbf{L}$ were preserved as documented from their original publications. The variety of cd-xQTL mapping strategies used across different studies led to significant differences in the format of summary statistics. We extracted key statistical metrics from each qualifying publication, including affected molecular

Figure 1. Overview of xQTLatlas. xQTLatlas pipeline begins with quality control using predefined publication filters, ollowed by a detailed examinatio and extraction of original variant-phenotype association data. Following his, statistical data are standardized and mputed, culminating n he development of unctional modules or $\times\mathsf{O T L}$ analysis and visualization.  

phenotypes and their annotations, genetic variants and associated statistical measures. Drawing on established practices from existing databases (4 30 , we standardized the format of cd- $\mathbf{\sigma}_{\mathrm{{xQTL}}}$ summary statistics within xQTLatlas. This standardization ensures that each entry consistently includes detailed nformation about phenotypes and variant ocations, alleles, associated $P$ values, standard errors, effect sizes and alse discovery rates. Where key statistical measures were absent in the original datasets, we supplemented these by imputing values based on available additional nformation. For example, n cases where standard error were not provided, we calculated them using available $P$ values and effect size.  

To augment xQTLatlas, we have integrated systematic variant annotations from VannoPortal (40 , providing detailed information on allele frequency, linkage disequilibrium, evolutionary conservation, unctional evidence and variant pathogenicity predictions across various tissues and cell types. Furthermore, nsights nto potential causal relationships between risk variants and complex traits from CAUSALdb (41  have been incorporated to enhance the database’s comprehensiveness.  

Ontology standardization and categorization xQTLatlas encompasses a wide array of molecular phenotypes, necessitating the standardization of terminology for both phenotypes and cell ypes o enhance he consistency and usability of the data. For each entry, we provide detailed annotations, ncluding the phenotype type, genomic regions and specific names. Each phenotype is meticulously defined with specific description and annotation standards. For example, methylation phenotypes are annotated using probe IDs and genomic regions, whereas transcription and gene phenotypes are standardized based on genomic positions and names, employing the latest GENCODE (42  Release 46 annotations from the GRCh38 version. Phenotypes lacking standardized annotations are described by chromosomal positions, such as $\cdot_{\mathrm{chr}6:32472840-32473244^{\prime}}$ for caQTL, and specific histone modifications like ‘H3K4me1(chr2:2131351–2132034)’ and $\cdot_{\mathrm{H3K27ac(chr6:32270482-32272947)}},$ .  

In terms of organizing cell type classification in xQTLatlas, we conducted a detailed manual review of each cell type as reported in the original studies. For each entry in xQTLatlas, we aligned and standardized annotations according to the tissue source, cell ype, cell state and cd- $\mathbf{\sigma}_{\mathrm{{xQTL}}}$ mapping strategies provided in the original research. The annotations of cell states include specific features described in the publications, such as particular gene states or conditions ike $\mathrm{\cdot}\mathrm{ATF1}+\mathrm{\cdot}^{\mathrm{\prime}}$ or active ranscription actor presence or interferon stimulation 24 $\mathbf{h}^{\ast}$ to indicate cellular response to treatment. This systematic review and annotation process ensures that each cell type in xQTLatlas is accurately represented and reflects the detailed cellular context provided by the original studies. Cell types from studies that lack specific tissue source information and are derived from in vitro cultures are classified under ‘Other’. Moreover, we standardized terms from the original publications by mapping them to the naming conventions of the Human Cell Landscape (43  and GTEx (44 , converting abbreviations to their full forms and aligning them with widely accepted reference names.  

# Database design  

xQTLatlas was constructed using a robust framework that incorporates MySQL (https://www.mysql.com  for database management and Java for backend development. Primary and composite indexing strategies were employed to optimize performance. A primary key index based on unique identifiers was used to expedite data retrieval and maintain data integrity Additionally a composite index, including chromosome and position columns, was implemented to accelerate specific queries. To further enhance performance, additional columns such as cell type, variant, phenotype and position were indexed, and a range-based partitioning strategy was adopted, segmenting the dataset into discrete, nonoverlapping sections of 10 million bp each. The user interface of xQTLatlas was developed with HTML, Vue.js (https: //vuejs.org/ and Plotly.js https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/ , incorporating JavaScript libraries for enhanced interaction. Furthermore, IGV.js (45  was integrated for interactive genomic visualization. For optimal performance, we recommend accessing xQTLatlas using web browsers ike Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, ensuring efficient and effective use of its functionalities.  

# Results  

# Overview of xQTLatlas  

The current version of xQTLatlas integrates summary statistics from 61 independent cd-xQTL studies, meticulously designed to ensure completeness and accuracy. Each dataset is manually annotated to include fundamental details such as tissue source, cell type and state. The entries in xQTLatlas are categorized into four main types based on the $\mathbf{xQTL}$ discovery methods detailed in the original publications: purified cell type $\mathbf{xQTL}$ , single cell $\mathbf{xQTL}$ , cell type/state interaction $\mathbf{xQTL}$ and in silico inferred cell type $\mathbf{xQTL}$ . These are further divided into 796 datasets affecting 13 molecular phenotypes (Supplementary Figure S1 . Single-cell sequencing, which allow for a finer examination of cell heterogeneity and diversity within tissues, contribute the most extensive datasets, representing $46.8\%$ of the total in xQTLatlas (Supplementary Figure S2 . Additionally, studies employing purified cell type and single-cell sequencing for xQTL mapping are the most common sources of data, accounting for $56.5\%$ and $25\%$ of xQTLatlas, respectively (Supplementary Figure S3 . xQTLatlas currently includes nearly 1.5 billion significant cd-xQTL entries ( $P$ value $<0.05$ ), covering 151 cell types and 339 cell states from 55 human tissues, providing an integrated genetic regulatory landscape with unmatched depth and breadth. xQTLatlas ensures accessibility through a user-friendly portal, enabling researchers without extensive computational backgrounds to engage effortlessly with the data. It features interactive modules for visualizing cd-xQTL summary statistics, including heatmaps, locus plots and scatter plots, along with a genome browser for visualizing genome-wide genetic associations. Moreover, all datasets and user-retrieved entries are downloadable in standardized formats for further analysis.  

# Comprehensive data exploration module  

xQTLatlas provides researchers with the capability to comprehensively explore cd-xQTL data rom multiple dimensions. Using the data exploration interface (Figure 2A), users can efficiently delve into all functional variants and their associations with phenotypes, organized systematically by $\mathbf{xQTL}$ type (Figure 2B). xQTLatlas supports multi-level exploration across genetic variants, molecular phenotypes and regions of interest, enabling precise targeting.  

Exploring variant When searching for specific variants using their genomic position or dbSNP ID in variant search mode, users are nitially presented with an overview organized by $\mathbf{xQTL}$ type and then by tissue type, as shown in Figure 2B. Users can hen select a $\mathbf{xQTL}$ ype of nterest or urther exploration. Upon choosing a specific subset of data, an interactive heatmap s displayed with he horizontal axis representing cell types and the vertical axis representing phenotypes. Each data cell in the heatmap represents a specific phenotype-variant association statistic, with he color ntensity ndicating he number of phenotype-variant associations Figure 2C). Clicking on a data cell in the heatmap reveals the association strength and effect size for functional variants across different phenotypes within that cell type, where the height of the bars in the histogram is determined by the median $-\log10\ P$ value of the phenotype-variant associations, and the color represents the median effect size Figure 2D). Additionally, he extent of specific phenotype-variant associations across cell types is also displayed, with data points colored according to the original publication Figure 2E). Beneath he cross-cell ype view at he bottom of the page, the summary statistics table is dynamically updated to reflect the user-selected data subset, simplifying the process of accessing and downloading relevant data (Figure 2F). Additionally, this dynamic table includes annotations of cellular context and phenotypes, as well as association $P$ values, effect size, standard error and alse discovery rate or each $\mathbf{xQTL}$ . t also includes external links to the original publications and detailed information about the genetic variants. We have also ntegrated GTEx, VannoPortal and CAUSALDB, providing users with systematic and context-specific variant annotations and causal effects. This integrated approach not only enhances user interaction by providing tailored information but also facilitates the direct extraction of specific xQTL data from the interface, significantly boosting the utility of xQTLatlas for targeted genetic research.  

Exploring phenotype  In the phenotype search mode, users start with an overview similar to the variant mode. However, in the interactive heatmap, the vertical axis represents different functional variants rather than phenotypes, with each cell in the heatmap denoting specific phenotype-variant association statistics. The color intensity of each cell is determined by the median $-\log10\ P$ value (Figure 3A). Clicking on a heatmap cell displays a locus plot for the selected cell type, illustrating the distribution of functional variants associated with the phenotype. The most significant cd- $\mathbf{\sigma}_{\mathbf{X}}\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{T}\mathbf{L}$ are specially marked (Figure 3B), and the color of the data points is determined by the publication source. Below this, a visualization shows the cross-cell type associations of variants (Figure 3C), and all modules enable comprehensive interaction with the data points. Like in the variant mode, the summary statistics table below provides cd- $\mathbf{\sigma}_{\mathrm{{xQTL}}}$ information.

D Further statistical graphs based on $\times\mathsf{O T L}$ statistics provide an overview of he association between different unctional variants and phenotypes. E Comparison of he strength of he association between variant and phenotype n different cell ypes. F Summary statistics able.  

Exploring regions of interest. Similar to the phenotype search mode, xQTLatlas enables customized exploration of the regulatory landscape within specific genomic regions. To ensure optimal performance, we recommend limiting the search range to within $200\mathrm{kb}$ . The interface features a search box in the overview section that allows users to query genetic associations for specific phenotypes within defined intervals. The data are organized in interactive heatmaps, locus plots and scatter plots, following the same user-friendly format as in he phenotype search mode Supplementary Figure S4 . This provides a consistent and efficient user experience.  

# Genome-wide association strength browser module  

xQTLatlas includes an interactive genomic browser that supports tailored exploration of diverse cd-xQTL datasets. Within the ‘Browser’ page, datasets are categorized by tissue, cell type, cell state, cd-xQTL mapping strategy and source of publication. Users can customize heir analysis by adding multiple tracks to compare multi-omics cd-xQTL datasets. xQTL datasets of nterest can be visualized by selecting hem hrough the ‘Show Track List’ button (Figure 3D), and users have the capability to save the comparative genomic structure of a specific region as an SVG file. In addition, xQTLatlas supports precise localization of genomic regions, phenotypes or variants in tracks, and highlights specific cd-xQTL data to better target user needs. Clicking on data points reveals detailed information about each cd- $\mathbf{\sigma}_{\mathrm{{xQTL}}}$ , including the dbSNP ID and the associated $P$ value. For instance, xQTLatlas illustrates a visualization of the genetic variants impacts on gene expression, histone modification and methylation within the same genomic region n naive $\mathrm{CD4+T}$ cells Figure 3D). n his context, functional variants exert a more significant regulatory effect on molecular phenotypes at the levels of methylation and histone modifications than on gene expression. This indicates that epigenetic modifications play a predominant role in shaping the functional landscape of this region, potentially directing differential gene activity hat could affect cellular behavior and responses. This underscores the complex interplay between different molecular mechanisms and emphasizes the utility of xQTLatlas in dissecting the multilayered genetic influences on cellular functions.  

# Discussion and future directions  

We have developed xQTLatlas, a comprehensive database designed to explore genetic regulatory landscapes at the cellular resolution. xQTLatlas supports multiscale data exploration and offers multidimensional visualization and analysis capabilities. It incorporates data from an array of cell types, cell states and cd-xQTL mapping strategies, enabling in-depth analysis to uncover the intricate regulatory structures of functional variants. xQTLatlas is distinguished by several innovative features: (i) The current version has meticulously curated hundreds of cd- $\mathbf{\sigma}_{\mathrm{{xQTL}}}$ datasets, organized in a hierarchical tree structure to facilitate efficient data access based on unique properties. (ii) Multi-level data exploration capabilities and distinctive interactive visualization modules allow users to explore genetic regulatory landscapes across various scales. iii) A genetic structural landscape browser for visualizes the association structures of multi-omics quantitative trait locus across the genome-wide. For further guidance, refer to the Tutorial page on xQTLatlas.

Compared to other resources that encompass partial cellular-resolution $\mathbf{xQTL}$ data, xQTLatlas exhibits significant advantages. Specifically, QTLbase (4  focuses primarily on tissue-level data, consequently providing limited cellular resolution $\mathbf{xQTL}$ . Furthermore, databases like scQTLbase, ImmuneRegulation (46  and SingleQ lack diversity in their $\mathbf{xQTL}$ mapping strategies, cell types, molecular phenotypes and visualization techniques. xQTLatlas integrates an extensive range of genetic regulatory resources based on various mapping strategies and molecular phenotypes, enhancing both the depth and breadth of the data. Additionally, by standardizing cell type terminology and systematically annotating functional variants along with their potential causal relationships, xQTLatlas significantly advances its practical utility. xQTLatlas features advanced visualization and exploration tools that enable interactive, multi-scale exploration, comparison and analysis of xQTL data. ts user-friendly interface significantly enhances researchers’ capacity to perform comprehensive studies of he genetic regulatory andscape, surpassing the functionalities of existing databases. As our understanding of the complexity and heterogeneity of biological systems deepens, tools like xQTLatlas become increasingly essential. It significantly advances the exploration of genetic regulatory mechanisms at the cellular level, which is crucial for elucidating how genetic variants operate across various cellular contexts.  

We plan to regularly update xQTLatlas, adding new data and features every 6 months to ensure our users have access to the latest and most relevant data in $\operatorname{cd-xQTL}$ research. With the evolution of new paradigms in population genetics, such as in vitro quantitative trait locus studies (47 48 , we are positioned to explore the effects of genetic variants in rare cell types and unravel the molecular basis of common genetic diseases. Additionally, we aim to incorporate a broader range of cell phenotypes, including response, migration and stress states, to serve a wider research community. Future plans also include expanding our analysis pipelines and visualization methods to enhance the functionality of xQTLatlas.

# ABSTRACT  

Automatic annotation of protein function is routinely applied to newly sequenced genomes. While this provides a fine-grained view of an organism’s functional protein repertoire, proteins, more commonly function in a coordinated manner, such as in pathways or multimeric complexes. Genome Properties (GPs) define such functional entities as a series of steps, originally described by either TIGRFAMs or Pfam entries. To increase the scope of coverage, we have migrated GPs to function as a companion resource utilizing InterPro entries. Having introduced GPs-specific versioned releases, we provide software and data via a GitHub repository, and have developed a new web interface to GPs (available at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ interpro/genomeproperties). In addition to exploring each of the 1286 GPs, the website contains GPs pre-calculated for a representative set of proteomes; these results can be used to profile GPs phylogenetically via an interactive viewer. Users can upload novel data to the viewer for comparison with the precalculated results. Over the last year, we have added $\sim700$ new GPs, increasing the coverage of eukaryotic systems, as well as increasing general coverage through automatic generation of GPs from related resources. All data are freely available via the website and the GitHub repository.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Modern DNA sequencing technologies have revolutionized our ability to sequence DNA for not only isolate organisms, but also collections of organisms (metagenomics). While the automatic transfer of annotations from a handful of characterized sequences to the genes encoded in a novel genome may be considered somewhat routine, especially for prokaryotic genomes, it nonetheless requires the identification of functional data in the scientific literature, as well as a method of defining those sequences that should acquire the transferred annotation. For the majority of automatic annotation in UniProtKB (1), the comprehensive protein sequence knowledgebase, those sequences are identified by InterPro (2) using profile-based protein family models (such as position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) or profile hidden Markov models (HMMs)), provided by various protein families databases and integrated into InterPro. These models provide much greater sensitivity in detecting diverse protein family members in comparison to single sequence matching methods.  

While the annotation of individual genes and proteins is an important prerequisite to understanding how an organism is adapted to its ecological niche, higher order functions are more often than not performed by multiple proteins. For example, where multiple proteins come together to form a functional complex, such as a transporter system, or where multiple proteins are required in a pathway, such as the biosynthesis of proline from glutamate, which is a fourstep process requiring three different enzymes to catalyse three steps in the pathway. Resources such as the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (3) and SEED subsystems (4) have been used extensively for the annotation of pathways, complexes and networks. While KEGG is widely used, certain parts of the data are no longer free for users, thus restricting use. Both KEGG and the SEED subsystems rely on BLAST-based searches for the transfer of genome annotations (5, 6). When first introduced, these BLAST-based methods had superior speed compared with HMMER2-based profile HMMs used by protein family databases. However, as the number of sequenced genomes has increased over time, the size of both reference and target sequence databases have significantly increased. This has a negative impact on the speed of pairwise BLAST-based searches, and has led to the adoption of algorithms which implement heuristics (e.g. GHOSTX (7)) to improve search speed. The advent of HMMER3 (8), along with more recent iterative improvements have enhanced the speed of profile HMM-based searches such that they are now equivalent to those of BLAST. As profile-based protein family reference databases are much smaller, and grow at linear rates whilst maintaining coverage, they offer a scalable and more sensitive solution compared to single sequence-based searches. This sensitivity is particularly important in relation to metagenomics where the analysis includes diverse organisms that are not reflected in the reference database (9,10).  

Genome Properties (GPs) was originally developed as an extension to the TIGRFAMs resource, providing a method to improve the functional annotation of prokaryotic genomes, and assist in comparative genomics (11–13). In essence, it consists of a queryable set of molecular reconstructions (e.g. of pathways), which allow the inference of the higher order functions that may be encoded in any given genome. For example, an organism can be proposed to synthesize biotin if its genome can be shown to encode the complete set of proteins required to perform the relevant biochemical steps in the pathway. The previous versions of GPs primarily utilized the profile HMMs produced by TIGRFAMs, which were supplemented by a small subset of Pfam (14) profile HMMs to determine the presence of the required proteins in the property. Restricting the available models to just these resources meant that there was a limitation in the number of specific family models available for use, as well as the taxonomic range of organisms that were able to be annotated.  

TIGRFAMs and Pfam are both part of InterPro, a freely available resource that allows users to classify protein sequences into families and predict important domains and sites within protein sequences (2). The breadth and depth of annotation in InterPro is achieved by combining protein family and domain prediction models (including, but not restricted to, profile HMMs) from a consortium of 14 specialist member data resources. The various protein models are combined to produce InterPro entries describing each protein family, domain or site in a unified way. InterProScan (15) is the software that underpins the comparison of protein sequences against the InterPro predictive models. InterPro matches for all protein sequences contained in the UniProtKB resource (1) are calculated on a monthly basis, providing a comprehensive and up-to-date set of functional annotations for all UniProtKB sequences.  

In light of the significantly larger collection of protein families models available in InterPro, we have extended GPs such that any InterPro entry (and hence associated member database signature) can be used to represent a GPs step. GPs has been migrated to EMBL-EBI and is now a companion database to InterPro. This allows GPs to leverage the InterProScan calculations that already exist for all UniProtKB sequences, thereby offering a simple and efficient process to predict the existence of a GP for any given species for which a proteome exists in UniProtKB. Herein, we describe the numerous developments to GPs during the transition to using InterPro, the functionality of the new GPs website, and the expansion in number of available GPs.  

# GENOME PROPERTIES DATA AND CALCULATION  

# Genome properties entry file format  

The original GPs dataset (as hosted at J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI)) was stored in a Sybase relational database, which lacked any form of external or portable curation interface. To simplify the data structure and curation of GPs, a flatfile format (DESCription file; DESC file) was designed that fully described each individual property. The format of the DESC file closely follows that of both the TIGRFAMs and Pfam DESC files, producing files in a format familiar to users and curators. A detailed description of the DESC file format is provided in the GPs documentation (https://genome-properties.readthedocs.io/ en/latest/index.html). Briefly, each DESC file is divided into two parts: the top half describes the property as a whole, including a one-line description of the property, a free-text field describing the property, as well as appropriate cross references to literature and other databases. In addition to these fields, there is a type field. There are currently six types of GP: pathway, metapath, system, guild, complex and category. The first five designate the various classes of functional attributes being described in each case. Categories are distinct from the others in that they do not seek to model a particular functional system but rather exist as organizational properties, allowing the other GPs to be viewed as a hierarchy. ‘Complex’ is a new type that we have added to the original five GP types, introduced to represent known macromolecular complexes (described in further detail below).  

The second half of the DESC file contains the molecular reconstruction (as a series of steps) that constitute that GP. Each step has at least one line of evidence to determine its presence within the proteome being analysed. This evidence can be one of two classes: (i) another GP (found in metapaths and categories) or (ii) an InterPro entry. Each step can be flagged as either required (necessary for the function of the property being modelled) or otherwise deemed optional. An important step in the integration of GPs to InterPro was the assignment of InterPro accessions to steps. For the majority of entries, the original evidence using TIGRFAMs and Pfam models have simply been uplifted to their corresponding InterPro entry. In cases where those original TIGRFAMs and Pfam models were not currently integrated into an InterPro entry, some curatorial input was required. While the ‘missing evidence’ was integrated wherever possible, another existing InterPro entry and model was chosen as replacement evidence for the step in cases where this wasn’t feasible.  

Further to the DESC file, a GP may also have a FASTA file that contains at least one example sequence that will resolve to a ‘yes’ for each step represented by an InterPro entry. These were created primarily for internal validation purposes as InterPro entries (and the constituent member databases) are not static, and as such, the chosen evidence may necessarily have to change over time. These FASTA files represent static examples of each protein being modelled within a GP, that should always be a match for any evidence used to define that step. Finally, each property also has a status file specifying if the property has been checked and can be made available in the GPs release/website (both described below). These files are collected within a single containing folder that represents a GPs entry.  

The original ‘TIGRFAMs’ GPs dataset contained 1077 properties, of which only a subset (584) was integrated into the InterPro companion resource. As well as those properties which conform to the description above, the ‘TIGRFAMs’ GPs set also included properties that utilize various other metrics to determine their presence/absence in a genome. For example, a substantial subset relies on information about the relative location of genes within the genome coding for the step evidence proteins. While such information is readily available in the context of analysing a genome, it is essentially lost when analysing a proteome as described here. It is clear that the inclusion of such information on genomic context can provide increased confidence in some GPs results, for example through determining if genes encoding individual steps exist within the same operon. However, while this is beyond the current scope of our reimplementation, it remains an area of focus we hope to pursue in future releases, given the potential benefits to validating results. Further subsets of the original ‘TIGRFAMs’ GPs rely on other calculable properties (such as GC content) or on manual assignment of relevant species. These other metrics are also beyond the scope, and as such these properties were not able to be included in the initial migration.  

# Accessing, contribution and validating GP entries  

In an effort to enable GPs to be both fully accessible and freely available, all our data and software associated with the curation, release and calculation are stored in a GitHub repository (https://github.com/ebi-pf-team/ genome-properties). In addition to facilitating access to the data (i.e. the DESC files), it allows users to report issues, suggest improvements to a property, and even propose new properties. This can be accomplished either by generating an issue on the repository website, using the GPs helpdesk email (GenProp@ebi.ac.uk) or by modifying a local checkout and generating a pull request. Indeed, the GitHub repository provides a full revision history of any changes that have been made to a particular property and by whom. Finally, the GitHub repository also contains basic documentation and downloadable bundles for each release version (discussed in further detail below).  

# Asserting the presence of a GP  

For the GP result to be a yes for any particular species, proteins matching the evidence for all required steps in that property must be found within the proteome of the species in question, asserted by being present in a single input file. In reality, there a number of reasons why it may not be possible to match evidence for every step. Some protein families are challenging to model, leading to a lack of existing suitable protein signature models to use as evidence. Alternatively, the specific enzyme required to carry out a step within a pathway may not be known. Equally, a particular step may be performed by a protein family that matches multiple proteins. While in a genome it may be feasible to ensure that the genes belong to a single operon, this is not possible when dealing with a set of proteins that come from a genome. Therefore, each property is assigned a threshold value to factor in such cases. This specifies the number of matched steps, above which a partial result can be reported, which is considered as a positive result. If the number of matched steps falls on or below the threshold, the property is reported as ‘not found’ in that species. These threshold values are not defined automatically (except in the case of semi-automatically produced GPs, described below) but rather they are manually curated on a property by property basis. In addition to accommodating the example scenarios detailed above, this curation of threshold values also allows for step evidences that function in multiple GPs to be taken into account, as they should not be considered as evidence of a property without supporting steps.  

The aforementioned GPs GitHub repository includes the software for assigning the properties (assign genome properties.pl), whose use is described in more detail on the calculating genome properties page of the website (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/genomeproperties/ #calculating). The script has a variety of output options with differing levels of detail, from summarizing which GPs are found, partial or absent, to a longer form that includes the result for each step, as well as a protein-centric report, indicating which proteins matched the evidence for a particular step. This script can be downloaded to analyse collections of proteomes locally. In addition to assigning GPs included in the latest release, the software is agnostic about the origin and content of the GPs file (genomeProperties.txt). This feature allows us (and users) to experiment with the development of new properties, before they are submitted to the resource by editing the file to include the experimental GP.  

# EXPANDING GENOME PROPERTIES  

The increased scope of InterPro entries has now allowed the addition of 702 new GPs (numbers correct for GP v2.0.1) since the original migration. A proportion of these new GPs $(\sim70)$ have been manually generated, although the manual creation of GPs is a time-consuming and curationheavy process. In an effort to increase the coverage of GPs in a timelier fashion, we pursued a process of integrating data from other macromolecular complex and pathway resources, to semi-automatically generate GPs describing entities found in those resources, thereby minimizing the amount of curation required.  

# Genome properties of type COMPLEX  

One source of semi-automatically generated GPs came from the Complex Portal (16), a resource that describes macromolecular complexes. The physical molecular interaction data found in the Complex Portal is derived from the literature and is hence restricted to a few key model organisms. In this first import from the Complex Portal, we focused on macromolecular complexes found in Escherichia coli, with a view to using GPs to identify the corresponding complexes in related organisms. As the Complex Portal provides crossreferences to both InterPro and UniProtKB, we automatically extracted the data to generate draft GPs entries. In the majority of cases, the UniProtKB sequence would match multiple InterPro entries, consequently a minimal curation step was included to select which InterPro entry should be used as evidence in each case. Typically, InterPro entries of type family were chosen preferentially over other entry types such as domain or homologous superfamily as they tend to be more specific. A single protein can also match multiple InterPro entries of the same type within a hierarchy, therefore in each case the most specific InterPro entry (lowest in the hierarchy), which still provided broad taxonomic coverage, was chosen. While the taxonomic range of each InterPro entry was not specifically compared, the consistent approach to their selection was aimed at being conservative. If a homologue for each complex component exists in a particular species, there is a strong likelihood that the complex will be found in that particular organism.  

# Additional PATHWAY genome properties  

MetaCyc (17) is a database of highly curated metabolic pathways covering all domains of life. Each MetaCyc entry is specific for a defined species, or set of species. While these data are highly curated, the MetaCyc website does not provide any form of sequence-similarity annotation transfer system, and therefore cannot be used to infer pathway function in species outside of those specifically covered. Through collaboration with MetaCyc and the TIGRFAMs team at JCVI, we performed an analysis of the data within MetaCyc to establish the subset of pathways that define a particular protein for every reaction within the pathway. This allowed us to automatically assign matching InterPro entries for each reaction/step, and so generate GPs automatically. A second pass was then carried out to filter the matched InterPro entries. This automatic filter used the same criteria as the manual selection described for Complex Portal entries, namely preferentially selecting InterPro type ‘family’ entries, and then further selecting the more specific entries. It should be noted that this is an entirely uncurated process, and as such, these data should be treated with more caution as specified in the description of these properties on the GPs website. However, this automated process allowed a substantial expansion of the coverage by GPs. It was never the goal to recreate the content of the MetaCyc resource at GPs, and we do not include any pathway descriptions for these GPs; rather we provide links back to MetaCyc for users to retrieve the pathway information there. Including these data in GPs allows assertions of these MetaCyc pathways to be made automatically for novel genomes/proteomes that would otherwise be challenging to achieve.  

# New eukaryote-specific genome properties  

The original GPs were biased towards prokaryotes, which is unsurprising considering TIGRFAMs - a prokaryotic protein family database - was primarily used for the evidence in these properties. Utilizing relevant InterPro entries, we have now expanded GPs to include eukaryote-specific properties, using MEROPS (18) as a source of new properties. The MEROPS website is a resource of proteolytic enzymes, and includes annotation of pathways that include these enzymes (and cross references KEGG pathways). Typically, while a very specific protein family annotation is required for identification of a proteolytic enzyme, most entries in InterPro that only use a profile HMM (e.g. Pfam) include homologous members with different specificities. PANTHER (19), another InterPro member database, uses a competitive scoring post-processing system to differentiate between related PANTHER subfamilies. Therefore, for the generation of MEROPS-sourced GPs, the evidences used were mostly PANTHER subfamilies, as they provided the necessary level of specificity of evidence.  

A consequence of the generation of new GPs from each of the resources described above was the requirement for some new type category properties to contain them, as the existing categories were designed to group predominantly prokaryotic properties. A total of 18 new categories were generated loosely based on grouping terms available at each of the source resources. The Complex Portal contains GO annotations (20) for most entries, therefore we were able to use high-level GO term assignments as a basis for category terms for Complex Portal-based entries. MetaCyc, on the other hand, already groups the pathways it describes into a hierarchy. This allowed us to use a subset of the ‘superclass’ terms provided by MetaCyc as a basis for the categories needed to describe MetaCyc-based GPs.  

# GENOME PROPERTIES RELEASES AND WEBSITE  

# Genome properties releases  

Prior to the migration, GPs releases had been tied to the TIGRFAMs release cycle. A significant alteration since migrating to InterPro is the establishment of independent GPs release versioning. While the GPs release cycle has been decoupled from the InterPro release cycle, each GPs release is tagged with the relevant InterProScan version upon which the GPs entries are built. The initial GPs release within InterPro (containing the subset of ‘TIGRFAMs’ GPs data described previously) became v1.0, the most recent release at time of writing is v2.0.1 (InterProScan version 5.30–69.0). Release notes are provided detailing not only the InterProScan version requirement, but also the counts of new properties of each type, as well as major sources of new data within that release.  

Various quality control checks are carried out on the data as part of the release process. These include ensuring that all properties are connected to the organizational hierarchy, either as members of a category, or as an evidence within a metapath. This ensures a path to every property within the browse feature of the website (see below). Further checks are carried out to verify that all InterPro IDs used as evidence are valid for the relevant InterProScan release, and that all properties requiring a FASTA file have one in place. A number of flatfiles (available within the GitHub repository) are produced as part of the release process, including a concatenation of DESC files for all properties included in the release. This file (genomeProperties.txt) provides an easy format for parsing, allowing release-specific GPs data to be used in external tools and workflows. Finally, a representative set of genomes/proteomes was established, which match a broad range of different GPs, and for which GPs matches/results are calculated at each release. These results are used on the website for the visualization of GPs data.  

# Website production and design of viewer  

The GPs website, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/ genomeproperties, is the predominant method by which we anticipate users will interact with GPs. The site can be broadly divided into three main sections: Browse, Viewer and About.  

The Browse section provides lists of properties categorized by type, as well as a hierarchy of properties that can be browsed (Figure 1A). A useful feature is the search functionality available for the hierarchical tree. This performs a simple string search on the property names. Having identified the property of interest, selecting it opens the property page showing the contents of the DESC file for that property in a human readable format (Figure 1B).  

The Viewer (Figure 1C) assists in the visual exploration of the representative proteomes, allowing the user to focus on species or pathways of interest. Furthermore, it permits the comparison of user-defined proteomes with these representative proteome sets. The viewer is organized as a matrix, with columns representing species (arranged as a taxonomic tree), and rows representing properties. The colour of each cell in the matrix indicates the presence (dark blue) or absence (grey) of the GP in the species. A lighter blue indicates partial evidence of the presence of the GP. To allow full interpretation of such partial matches, each row in the matrix can be further expanded to display the results for each individual step within a property. Users can specify the representative species that they would like to see the data for, either by navigating the taxonomic tree, or by searching with species name or tax ID. It is also possible to upload a novel user-defined proteome for comparison against the representative set. The supported file format is the InterProScan TSV output file. GP results are calculated for the given file, and the results are displayed in the viewer alongside the existing set. Several filters and visualization options are available to limit the size and complexity of the resulting matrix.  

Finally, the About pages provide background information on the concepts of GPs, as well as links to supporting resources such as documentation, stored using Read the Docs (https://genome-properties.readthedocs.io/ en/latest/index.html), and online training modules. There are two supporting training modules, both hosted as part of the EMBL-EBI Train Online courses: a quick tour providing a brief overview of the website, and a tutorial covering more in-depth functionalities of the website as well as the underlying concepts of GPs.  

# COVERAGE OF PROTEOMES  

In an effort to understand the utility of GPs compared to other similar resources, namely KEGG and SEED subsystems, we were keen to undertake a comparison of the resources to quantify the overlap versus uniqueness of each resource. However, performing a meaningful comparison between these resources is not straightforward, as it is not possible to map directly between the resources due to the differences in granularity of entries, and in nomenclature used to describe similar or equivalent steps. Thus, we undertook to compare the number of sequences annotated by each resource for a small range of proteomes. These proteomes were chosen based on taxonomic range, as well as offering a range of proteome sizes and a distribution of wellstudied model organism genomes to those that are relatively less experimentally characterized. To accomplish this, we downloaded the proteomes, SEED subsystems and KEGG pathway annotations from PATRIC (version 3.5.21) (21) for six different species. We calculated InterPro matches using InterProScan, thus determining the GPs results for each proteome based on the InterPro matches. To enable a fair comparison and eliminate the few non-specific models utilized by GPs which had the potential to over-inflate the number of sequence matches for GPs, we excluded all protein matches where a single step evidence matched more than three different proteins within the proteome. Figure 2 shows the overall annotation of each proteome by KEGG, SEED subsystems and GPs. Within each column, the two different shades indicate sequences that are annotated by one or more of the other resources, and sequences that are uniquely annotated by that resource. A more detailed breakdown of the coverage is provided in Table 1. All three resources provide a notable number of unique annotations for the six proteomes presented. Due to the broader scope of SEED subsystems and GPs, it is unsurprising that these always annotate more sequences than KEGG, and typically have the most annotations in common when comparing the resources pairwise. In two of the six proteomes (Prochlorococcus marinus and Methanohalophilus halophilus), GPs provides the greatest annotation coverage.  

# APPLICATION TO MICROBIAL GENOMICS  

GPs provides a useful annotation scheme to investigate the functional repertoire contained within complex microbial communities, primarily those from which complete protein sequences can be predicted and grouped together (e.g. genome/metagenome assemblies). To illustrate this, we investigated the GP profiles of a set of 2468 genomes from the Human Microbiome Project catalog (https://www.hmpdacc.org/catalog/) and the Human Gastrointestinal Bacteria Genome Collection (22). Protein coding sequences were first predicted for each genome using prodigal (23) and subsequently characterized with InterProScan (15). Thereafter, GPs results were calculated using the assign genome properties.pl script (available within the GitHub repository) on the InterProScan results. After converting the GPs results to numeric values ( $\mathbf{No}=0$ ; Partial $\c=$ 1; ${\mathrm{Yes}}=2{\mathrm{\:}}$ ) we performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of all these human-isolated genomes using the GPs to look for distinguishing patterns. This revealed a strong separation of the genomes according to their classified phylum (Figure 3A, ANOSIM $R=0.66$ , $P<0.001$ ), highlighting that GPs are able to strongly differentiate the functional properties of genomes from distinct genetic backgrounds. Our results raise the possibility of leveraging GPs to complement and validate other taxonomy-based analysis types, e.g. derived from phylogenetic inference based on conserved marker genes (24, 25), which is vital for analysis of metagenomic assemblies. By further exploring the distribution of GPs across phyla (Figure 3B), patterns of presence/absence could be observed, where certain GPs were found exclusively in specific phylogenetic groups (e.g. Bacteroidetes), while others were conserved across all species. This exemplifies a useful strategy to identify core functions that may play a crucial role in adaptation to specific host environments, and can be extended to both reference and metagenomeassembled genomes. As more sequence data becomes available, having access to a reference catalogue of properties from particular biomes will provide important insights into the functional diversity and ecology of different microbial ecosystems.

(C) Website viewer loaded with data for gammaproteobacteria (taxonomy IDs of species shown along the top), and GPs terms filtered for ‘biosynthesis’. Colours of cells indicate the result for each GP in each species (dark blue $\c=$ yes, light blue $\c=$ partial, grey $=\mathrm{nc}$ ). Clicking on the expansion arrows (indicated by the top red circle and arrow in figure) opens up the step results for that GP, as shown for Threonine biosynthesis from aspartate semialdehyde. Clicking on the $^+$ sign which is revealed (indicated by the bottom red circle in figure), opens a pop-up (indicated by the bottom red arrow in the figure) providing the step names as well as step results for that GP.  

# DISCUSSION  

The integration of GPs into InterPro brings numerous benefits to both resources. While the protein signatures used to define the steps in the original GPs came from the TIGRFAMs and Pfam resources, InterPro has a further 12 member databases, whose protein signature models are integrated into InterPro entries. This greatly increases the potential pool of models, as well as taxonomic range, that can be used to define existing properties, as well as to create new properties.

One of the most significant benefits of using InterPro entries in the description of GPs is the ability to calculate GPs easily and swiftly, based on InterProScan results (which are maintained for UniProtKB). The coupling of such workflows allows users to efficiently analyse proteins encoded by genomes and metagenomes and thus make high level functional inferences, as well as being able to access those finer-grained details provided by InterPro and InterPro2GO. Calculating the output of all GPs for any given species, allows the resultant set of present, absent and partial results to be thought of as a fingerprint for that species. Comparing GPs fingerprints for a large number of genomes greatly reduces the computational overhead of phylogenetically profiling that set of genomes. In the case of bacterial genomes, rather than comparing the presence or absence of a few thousand protein families, users are able to compare the fingerprints composed of a few hundred GPs. Furthermore, as GPs provide a clear provenance of their calculation, such profiling approaches will allow the identification of taxonomic clades where a protein family in InterPro lacks sensitivity, or where an alternative step may have evolved.  

In analysing the comparison of coverage between GPs, KEGG and SEED subsystems, it is unsurprising that there is a common core set of proteins annotated by all. Due to our import from MetaCyc, we have not included a comparison of GPs to MetaCyc, but as demonstrated here and previously (26), despite the common core set, KEGG, SEED subsystems, MetaCyc and GPs each have unique coverage due to the differences in scope of each of the resources and the functional pathways and systems that have been included to date.

An ANOSIM test was performed by phylum using the Gower distance measure. (B) Heatmap depicting presence (blue), partial (grey) and absence (white) of the GPs (columns) contained within the human-specific genomes (rows). The dendrogram represents the hierarchical clustering of the GPs based on the patterns across the genomes.  

Finally, the new close relationship of GPs with InterPro and UniProtKB creates opportunities for rapidly expanding GPs based on the annotations found in these resources, as well as the integration of further data, such as the Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers and reaction identifiers contained in Rhea and/or MetaCyc.

# ABSTRACT  

As a reversible post-translational modification (PTM) discovered decades ago, protein lysine acetylation was known for its regulation of transcription through the modification of histones. Recent studies discovered that lysine acetylation targets broad substrates and especially plays an essential role in cellular metabolic regulation. Although acetylation is comparable with other major PTMs such as phosphorylation, an integrated resource still remains to be developed. In this work, we presented the compendium of protein lysine acetylation (CPLA) database for lysine acetylated substrates with their sites. From the scientific literature, we manually collected 7151 experimentally identified acetylation sites in 3311 targets. We statistically studied the regulatory roles of lysine acetylation by analyzing the Gene Ontology (GO) and InterPro annotations. Combined with protein– protein interaction information, we systematically discovered a potential human lysine acetylation network (HLAN) among histone acetyltransferases (HATs), substrates and histone deacetylases (HDACs). In particular, there are 1862 triplet relationships of HAT-substrate-HDAC retrieved from the HLAN, at least 13 of which were previously experimentally verified. The online services of CPLA database was implemented in $\mathsf{P H P}+\mathsf{M y s o L}+$ JavaScript, while the local packages were developed in JAVA 1.5 (J2SE 5.0). The CPLA database is freely available for all users at: http://cpla .biocuckoo.org.  

# INTRODUCTION  

There are two types of acetylation processes widely occurred in proteins (1–8). The first $\mathbf{N}^{\tilde{\alpha}}.$ -terminal acetylation is catalyzed a variety of N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs), which co-translationally transfer acetyl moieties from acetyl-coenzyme A (Acetyl-CoA) to the $\mathfrak{a}$ -amino $(\mathbf{N}^{\alpha})$ group of protein amino-terminal residues (1,2). Although $\mathbf{N}^{\propto}$ -terminal acetylation is rare in prokaryotes, it was estimated that ${\sim}85\%$ of eukaryotic proteins are $\mathbf{N}^{\alpha}$ -terminally modified (1,2). The second type is $N^{\mathrm{{\varepsilon}}}$ -lysine acetylation, which specifically modifies e-amino group of protein lysine residues (3–8). Although $N^{\mathrm{{\varepsilon}}}$ -lysine acetylation is less common, it’s one of the most important and ubiquitous post-translational modifications (PTMs) conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (1,2). Moreover, the acetylation and deacetylation are dynamically and temporally regulated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), respectively (4–8).  

In 1964, Allfrey et al. (9) first observed that lysine acetylation of histones plays an essential role in regulation of gene expression. Later and recent studies in epigenetics solidified this seminal discovery, and proposed acetylation as a key component of the ‘histone code’ (6). Beyond histones, a wide-range of non-histone proteins can also be lysine acetylated, and involved in a variety of biological processes, such as transcription regulation (10), DNA replication (11), cellular signaling (12), stress response (13) and so on. Aberrance of lysine acetylation and deacetylation is associated with various diseases and cancers (5,7,14). In particular, acetylation was demonstrated to be implicated in cellular metabolism and aging (15–17), while one class of $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ dependent HDACs of sirtuins might be potent drug target for promoting longevity (13,17).  

Although a great number of efforts have been carried out during the past four decades, the functional contents of lysine acetylation are still far from fully understood. In this regard, identification of acetylated substrates with their sites is fundamental for understanding the molecular mechanisms and regulatory roles of acetylation. In contrast with labor-intensive and time-consuming conventional experimental approaches, recent progresses in acetylome with high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS) have detected thousands of acetylation sites. In 2006, Kim et al. (14) performed a large-scale identification of acetylome with an anti-acetyllysine antibody. There were 195 acetylated proteins with 388 sites detected in HeLa cells and mouse liver mitochondria (14). With a similar strategy, Choudhary et al. (11) experimentally identified 3600 acetylation sites in human. In 2010, Zhao et al. (16) discovered 1047 acetylated substrates in human liver, and demonstrated acetylation playing a major role in metabolic regulation. Furthermore, two acetylomic studies revealed that the functions of lysine acetylation are conserved in Escherichia coli (18) and Salmonella enterica (15).  

Since the number of known acetylation sites has rapidly increased, it is an urgent topic to collect the experimental data and provide an integrated resource for the community. Recently, several public databases, such as PhosphoSitePlus (19), HPRD (20), SysPTM (21) and dbPTM (22), have already contained protein acetylation information. In these databases, both of $\mathbf{N}^{\propto}$ -terminal and $N^{\mathrm{{\varepsilon}}}$ -lysine acetylation data were curated, while lysine acetylation sites are usually only a limited part of total sites. For example, SysPTM 1.1 contains 3001 acetylation sites in 2000 proteins, with only 345 lysine sites $(\sim11.5\%)$ in 397 substrates (21). In dbPTM 2.0, 2071 experimentally verified acetylation sites were collected in 1525 proteins, with only 792 lysine sites $(\sim38.2\%)$ in 299 targets (22). Interestingly, HPRD release 9 contains 4691 total sites in 1987 proteins, with 4420 lysine sites $(\sim94.2\%)$ in 1821 substrates (20). However, HPRD database only focuses on human protein information (20), while thousands of lysine acetylation sites in other species still remain to be collected.  

With the motivation to meet the desire for complete acetylomes, here we developed a novel database of compendium of protein lysine acetylation (CPLA). From the scientific literature in PubMed, we manually curated 3311 acetylated proteins with 7151 lysine sites (Table 1). In CPLA database, the primary references and other annotations of these substrates were provided, while the protein–protein interaction (PPI) information was also integrated. Based on the Gene Ontology (GO) and InterPro annotations, we carried out an analysis of functional diversities and regulatory roles of lysine acetylation. As $75.64\%$ of total lysine acetylation sites are taken from Homo sapiens, a potential human lysine acetylation network (HLAN) among HATs, substrates and HDACs was constructed, with 1019 PPIs among 199 proteins. Interestingly, we revealed 1862 potential triplet relationships of HAT-substrate-HDAC, while at lease 13 were previously experimentally verified. Taken together, the CPLA database might be an integrated resource for protein lysine acetylation and provide useful information for further experimental or computational considerations.

# CONSTRUCTION AND CONTENT  

To ensure the quality of CPLA database, we searched the PubMed with a major keyword ‘acetylation’ and collected experimentally identified lysine acetylated proteins with their sites from more than 18 500 published articles (before 1 March 2010). To avoid missing data, we also search more articles with keywords ‘acetylated’ and ‘acetyl’. After all substrates with unambiguous acetylation lysines were collected, we searched the UniProt Knowledgebase (23) to obtain the corresponding protein sequences and associated annotation information. The theoretical $\ensuremath{\mathbf{p}}I$ (isoelectric point) and Mw (molecular weight) were calculated for each protein (http:// www.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html) (24,25).  

In CPLA database, the PPI information was also integrated if available. We took experimental PPIs from several major public databases (on 10 April 2010), such as HPRD (20), BioGRID (26), DIP (27), MINT (28) and IntAct (29). The redundant PPIs were thoroughly cleared. In addition, a well-known pre-predicted database of STRING (30) was also used. All proteins were mapped to the UniProt sequences by BLAST. For human, we collected a total of 59 481 experimental PPIs in 12 221 proteins and 1 212 607 predicted PPIs in 16 523 proteins, respectively. The detailed statistics of PPI information was shown in Supplementary Table S1.  

The CPLA 1.0 database contains 7151 lysine acetylation sites in 3311 substrates (Table 1). Particularly, 1742 $(\sim24.4\%)$ acetylation sites in 726 proteins are collected from non-human species (Table 1). The online service and local packages were implemented in $\mathrm{PHP+}$ $\mathrm{\bfMySQL+}$ JavaScript and JAVA 1.5 (J2SE 5.0), separately. Moreover, the online documentation and a user manual were also provided.

Users could click on the CPLA ID (CPLA-000025) to visualize the detailed information. (C) The detailed information of human STAT3. The PPI information was also presented.  

# USAGE  

The CPLA database 1.0 was developed in a user-friendly manner. The search option (http://cpla.biocuckoo.org search.php) provides an interface for querying the CPLA 1.0 database with one or several keywords such as gene/ protein names, UniProt ID or CPLA ID, etc. For example, if the keyword ‘STAT3’ is inputted and submitted (Figure 1A), the result will be shown in a tabular format, with the features of CPLA ID, UniProt accession and protein/gene names/aliases (Figure 1B). By clicking on the CPLA ID (CPLA-000136), the detailed information for human STAT3 will be shown (Figure 1C). The acetylation information, including acetylated positions, flanking peptides, experimental reagents or upstream HATs, and primary references are provided. The protein sequence, GO annotation, domain organization, molecular weight, computed/ theoretical $I_{\mathrm{p}}$ and PPI information are also presented.  

Furthermore, we provided three additional advance options, including (i) advance search, (ii) browse and (iii) BLAST search (Supplementary Figure S1). (i) Advance search: in this option, users could use relatively complex and combined keywords to locate the precise information, with up to two search terms. The interface of search-engine permits the querying by different database fields and the linking of queries through three operators of ‘and’, ‘or’ and ‘exclude’ (Supplementary Figure S1A). (ii) Browse: instead of searching for a specific protein, all entries of CPLA database could be listed by species name (Supplementary Figure S1B). (iii) BLAST search: this option was designed for finding related information in CPLA database quickly. The blastall program of NCBI BLAST packages (31) was included in CPLA 1.0 database (Supplementary Figure S1C). Users can input a protein sequence in FASTA format for searching identical or homologous proteins.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  

Recent progresses toward understanding the full functional content of acetylome have experimentally revealed several thousands of lysine acetylated substrates with their sites. Besides experimental efforts, computational studies such as predictor construction and database development also attract much attention. The current available computational resources were summarized and listed in Supplementary Table S2. Among these researches, database development is particularly important for integrating experimental data from heterogeneous sources, and providing a high quality benchmark for further experimental or computational designs. Although several public databases (19–22) have already maintained the acetylation information, the lysine acetylation is usually collected together with another less controlled $\mathbf{N}^{\propto}$ -terminal acetylation. In this work, we only focused on protein lysine acetylation and manually curated 7151 lysine acetylation sites in 3311 proteins.  

Since a large proportion of acetylation sites were taken from Homo sapiens, we had the opportunity to analyze abundance and functional diversity of lysine acetylation in an acetylomic level. We surveyed the GO terms of 2585 acetylated proteins from UniProt annotations. Using the human proteome as the background, we statistically calculated over-represented biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components in acetylome with the hypergeometric distribution $(P<0.01)$ ). The top five most enriched GO entries in each category were shown in Table 2. Our analyses revealed several potentially interesting results. For example, the three most abundant biological processes such as translational elongation, RNA splicing and mRNA processing suggest that acetylation predominantly regulates gene expression in a posttranscriptional manner (Table 2). Also, four most over-represented molecular functions such as ATP binding, protein binding, RNA binding and nucleotide binding suggest that acetylation modulates enzyme activity and protein interaction ability (Table 2). In addition, the statistical analysis of cellular components revealed acetylated proteins to be highly enriched in distinct cellular compartments. For instance, ${\sim}30$ and ${\sim}62\%$ of cytosol and mitochondrial matrix proteins are acetylated, respectively (Table 2). For more detailed information, the top 15 most over-represented GO terms and InterPro domains were shown in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4.  

The acetylation and deacetylation of proteins are carried out by HATs and HDACs, which antagonistically and dynamically control protein function. Combined with experimental and predicted PPIs, we constructed a potential HLAN among HATs, substrates and HDACs, with 1019 PPIs of 199 proteins (Supplementary Table S5). If only experimental PPIs are considered, the core HLAN contained 369 PPIs among 77 proteins, including 12 HATs and 12 HDACs (Figure 2). From the whole HLAN, we retrieved 1862 potential triplet relations of HAT–substrate–HDAC (Supplementary Table S6). If a substrate is a HAT or HDAC, it should be acetylated or deacetylated by a different HAT or HDAC. We carefully surveyed scientific literature and found that at least 13 triplet interactions were experimentally identified (Supplementary Table S6). For example, Gaughan et al. (32) observed that Tip60 (KAT5) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) regulate the transcriptional activity of androgen receptor (AR) through changing its acetylation status, and form a KAT5-AR-HDAC1 relation (Supplementary Table S6). Moreover, our results also discovered a number of potentially interesting results. For instance, EP300 acetylates BCL6 at K379 and inhibits its function, while deacetylases were not clearly identified (33). In our results, the EP300-BCL6-HDAC5, EP300-BCL6-SIRT2, EP300- BCL6-HDAC11, EP300-BCL6-HDAC3, EP300-BCL6- HDAC2 and EP300-BCL6-HDAC8 suggested that BCL6 might be deacetylated by multiple HDACs (Supplementary Table S6). Moreover, human GCMa/GCM1 was reported to be acetylated by CBP/CREBBP at K367, K406 and K409 (34). In our results, the relations of CREBBPGCM1-HDAC3, CREBBP-GCM1-HDAC3, CREBBPGCM1-HDAC1 and CREBBP-GCM1-HDAC4 proposed that at least four HDACs might deacetylate GCM1 (Supplementary Table S6).

Taken together, here we developed a comprehensive database of protein lysine acetylation. The statistical analyses revealed functional diversity and enrichment of acetylation, while network studies generated a large number of potentially useful results for further experimental or computational researches. The CPLA database will be routinely updated if new acetylated substrates are reported.

# ABSTRACT  

CRISPR–Cas is an anti-viral mechanism of prokaryotes that has been widely adopted for genome editing. To make CRISPR–Cas genome editing more controllable and safer to use, anti-CRISPR proteins have been recently exploited to prevent excessive/prolonged Cas nuclease cleavage. Anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins are encoded by (pro)phages/(pro)viruses, and have the ability to inhibit their host’s CRISPR–Cas systems. We have built an online database AcrDB (http://bcb.unl.edu/AcrDB) by scanning $\sim19\ 000$ genomes of prokaryotes and viruses with AcrFinder, a recently developed AcrAca (Acr-associated regulator) operon prediction program. Proteins in Acr-Aca operons were further processed by two machine learning-based programs (AcRanker and PaCRISPR) to obtain numerical scores/ranks. Compared to other anti-CRISPR databases, AcrDB has the following unique features: (i) It is a genome-scale database with the largest collection of data (39 799 Acr-Aca operons containing Aca or Acr homologs); (ii) It offers a user-friendly web interface with various functions for browsing, graphically viewing, searching, and batch downloading Acr-Aca operons; (iii) It focuses on the genomic context of Acr and Aca candidates instead of individual Acr protein family and (iv) It collects data with three independent programs each having a unique data mining algorithm for cross validation. AcrDB will  

# be a valuable resource to the anti-CRISPR research community.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) are constantly attacked by viruses (1). According to the red queen hypothesis, prokaryotes and their viruses have been under endless arms race for billions of years (2). To avoid viral infections, prokaryotes have evolved an arsenal of anti-viral defense mechanisms (3) encoded in their genomes, e.g., restriction– modification (RM) systems, CRISPR–Cas systems and toxin–antitoxin (TA) systems (4,5). To overcome these defense systems, viruses have developed anti–anti-viral (or anti-defense) strategies (6), among which anti-CRISPRs specifically inhibit CRISPR–Cas systems of their hosts (7).  

In addition, the current CRISPR–Cas genome editing tools, which are widely employed in numerous research labs and companies worldwide, are not perfectly safe to use in humans (8,9). As the naturally occurring inhibitors of CRISPR–Cas, anti-CRISPRs have a great application in the development of safer and more controllable CRISPR–Cas genome editing tools. Since 2017, over 15 cases have already been published to apply Acrs to finely control CRISPR–Cas gene editing, gene regulation, epigenetic modification, DNA imaging, and gene drive (recently reviewed in (10)). It is certain that more Acr applications will happen with acceleratingly more Acrs being discovered.  

Anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins were first discovered in 2013 in Pseudomonas phages and prophages (11). Acr encoding genes often form operons with putative transcription regulator genes that encode Acr-associated (Aca) proteins (12,13). Since 2013, 65 experimentally characterized Acr proteins (43 since 2018 and 18 already in 2020) have been published, and most of them had been identified with the help of bioinformatics (7,14,15). Notably, very little sequence similarity is found between characterized Acrs, and most of them do not have any conserved Pfam domains and have no homology to known proteins. Given that CRISPR– Cas is so broadly distributed in prokaryotes (16) and the genomic diversity of their viruses is astronomically high (17), it is believed that the 65 experimentally characterized antiCRISPRs only represent the tiny tip of an iceberg of the possible anti-CRISPR diversity in nature (7,12,18). This means that more Acr subtypes are waiting to be discovered in various taxonomic groups, and more advanced computational approaches are needed other than the classical sequence homology-based approach.  

Bioinformatics prescreening genomes has been a critical step in characterization of new anti-CRISPRs (7,14,15). However, compared to experimental studies, relatively fewer bioinformatics tool development has been published for anti-CRISPR research. Table 1 lists all bioinformatics resources that are currently online, among which two are databases for experimentally characterized Acrs and their homologs (19,20), and one (21) is a database for Acrs predicted with machine learning.  

Additionally, in the year 2020, four standalone/webserver bioinformatics tools become available for automated Acr discovery (Table 1). Three of these tools were developed by authors of this paper: AcrFinder (22), AcRanker (23) and PaCRISPR (24). AcrFinder implemented a bioinformatics pipeline that was reported in (25), where we developed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify genomic operons containing Acr homologs and/or Aca homologs by combining three computational approaches: homology, GBA (guilt-by-association), and STS (self-targeting spacer) (26). AcRanker uses amino acid compositions of known Acr and non-Acr proteins to train an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ranking algorithm to rank putative Acr proteins in a given test proteome, and has been used to assist experimental discovery of novel Acr proteins (23). PaCRISPR builds position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) to capture evolutionary features in Acr alignments, and then trains a support vector machine (SVM) for Acr classification (24). All these three recent tools have their strengths and weaknesses, and we were motivated to combine predictions from three independent tools to create a comprehensive Acr-Aca operon database with a user-friendly website.  

Briefly, combining AcrFinder (22), AcRanker (23), and PaCRISPR (24), we have performed a large-scale bioinformatics data mining for putative Acr-Aca operons in all sequenced genomes of bacteria, archaea, and their viruses. As a result, a new pre-computed Acr-Aca operon database AcrDB was developed. As described in our previous papers (22) and (25), putative Acr-Aca operons are defined as genomic loci meeting the following criteria: (i) all genes on the same strand (running in the same direction); (ii) all intergenic distance ${<}150$ bp; (iii) all genes encode proteins ${<}200$ aa; (iv) at least one gene homologous to known Acr or Aca proteins.  

The only three published online Acr databases (Table 1) include: anti-CRISPRDB (19), CRISPRminer (20), and  

AcrCatalog (21). Anti-CRISPRDB and CRISPRminer focus on experimentally characterized Acr proteins and their homologs. AcrCatalog provides predicted Acrs by using a decision tree-based machine learning algorithm but has very minimum web utilities.  

# DATA COLLECTION  

We have scanned 15 203 complete bacterial genomes, 961 (complete and draft) archaeal genomes and 2658 complete prokaryotic viral genomes of the NCBI RefSeq database to identify potential Acrs and their associated operons. Here ‘draft’ means the genomes contain contigs or scaffolds with gaps, while ‘complete’ means the genomes are fully assembled into chromosomes without gaps. The scanning process (Figure 1) was started by running our standalone AcrFinder (https://github.com/HaidYi/acrfinder) program on all the genomes, followed by running AcRanker on genomes containing predicted Acr-Aca operons. We have also run PaCRISPR only on proteins in AcrFinder predicted Acr-Aca operons, as PaCRISPR is much slower than AcrFinder and AcRanker and not suitable for genome-scale Acr predictions. In other words, data in AcrDB were primarily generated by AcrFinder, but were further scored and ranked by AcRanker and PaCRISPR.  

The detailed algorithm and methodology of the three tools, as well as their prediction evaluation results have been described in our previous papers (22–25). Briefly, AcrFinder integrates a multi-step genome processing pipeline, which includes identifications of CRISPR–Cas loci, self-targeting spacers (STSs) (27), Acr and Aca homologs, Acr-Aca operons, prophages, and examination of gene neighborhood of these genetic elements (Figure 1). According to the presence/absence of STSs and the proximity to STSs in the genome, Acr-Aca operons are also classified into three groups: high (presence of STSs nearby), medium (presence of STSs but not nearby), or low confidence (absence of STSs in the genome) groups (22). After the AcrFinder step, 419, 5850 and 2044 genomes of archaea, bacteria and viruses, respectively, were found to have Acr-Aca operons each containing at least one Acr homolog or Aca homolog. For these genomes, two AcRanker runs were made (Figure 1): one to rank all the proteins in the genome (i.e. the complete proteome), while the other only to rank all the prophage proteins in the genome (a subset of the proteome). The top $10\%$ ranked proteins in the two runs were then intersected with the Acr-Aca operons from AcrFinder. Acr-Aca operons containing top $10\%$ ranked proteins are considered to be more confident candidates according to the AcRanker paper (23). Meanwhile, after the AcrFinder step, all the 57 879 proteins (unique IDs) of the predicted Acr-Aca operons were processed by PaCRISPR to receive a prediction score (Figure 1) and those with a score $>0.5$ were considered as more confident candidates according to the PaCRISPR paper (24).  

# DATABASE CONTENT  

As shown in Table 2, Acr-Aca operons with homologs of known Acr proteins are found in only a small percentage of genomes: $2.8\%$ (27/961) Archaea, $7.4\%$ Bacteria and ${\bar{3}}.4\%$

Figure 1. Overview of data collection for AcrDB. Genomes of A (Archaea), B (Bacteria), and V (Viruses) are used as input for AcrFinder. Within AcrFinder, Acr homologs, Aca homologs, CRISPR–Cas loci, self-targeting spacers (STSs) and their targets (red diamonds) are identified. Acr and Aca homologs are analyzed to see if they form operons, if they are adjacent to or within a prophage region and/or to an STS target. Genomes with AcrFinder result are further analyzed by AcRanker to receive a rank and score, by PaCRISPR to receive a score, and lastly to locate the top ranked proteins in Acr-Aca operons.  

Viruses. This is expected as most known Acr proteins tend to have very few homologs in the public databases. These percentages, however, are much higher for Acr-Aca operons with Aca homologs (all confidence levels, defined in (22)): $43.5\%$ (418/961) Archaea, $33.0\%$ Bacteria and $76.9\%$ Viruses, consistent with the fact that Aca proteins are much more conserved than Acr proteins. Furthermore, although genomes without CRISPR self-targeting spacers (STSs) can also have anti-CRISPRs (25), genomes with STSs are more likely to encode Acrs to avoid autoimmunity. When only considering operons found in genomes with STSs, as only a small number of genomes have STSs, a much lower percentage of genomes is found to have both STSs and AcrAca operons (high and medium confidence levels): $8.8\%$ (85/961) Archaea and $7.2\%$ Bacteria.  

As mentioned above, proteins were also ranked/scored by AcRanker and PaCRISPR (Figure 1) in terms of the likelihood of sharing similar amino acid compositions or sharing sequence profiles with known Acr proteins. When counting Acr-Aca operons encoding at least one protein ranked in the top $10\%$ of all the proteins of the genome, $30.5\%$ (293/961) archaeal, $31.3\%$ bacterial and $50.0\%$ of viral genomes remained to have Acr-Aca operons. Applying all the conditions (with Aca homologs in the operon, with STSs in the genome, and with proteins ranked in the top $10\%$ by AcRanker) as the filters found only 75 and 2565 Acr  

Aca operons from 67 $(7.0\%)$ and 1045 $(6.9\%)$ genomes of Archaea and Bacteria, respectively. Similarly, when counting Acr-Aca operons encoding at least one protein with PaCRISPR score ${>}0.5$ , $25.7\%$ (247/961) archaeal, $18.4\%$ bacterial and $58.0\%$ of viral genomes remained to have AcrAca operons. Applying all the conditions (with Aca homologs in the operon, with STSs in the genome, and with proteins scored $>0.5$ by PaCRISPR) as the filters found only 64 and 1869 Acr-Aca operons from 53 $(5.5\%)$ and 796 $(5.2\%)$ genomes of Archaea and Bacteria, respectively.  

Altogether AcrFinder identified 1481 (Archaea) $+\ 31$ 683 (Bacteria) $\cdot+\ 4125$ (Viruses) $=37$ 289 Acr-Aca operons (Table 1 and Figure 2A). These operons include 25,353 $(68.0\%)$ operons that are from genomes with STSs, or contain at least one protein meeting the rank/score thresholds of AcRanker and PaCRISPR (Figure 2A). Operons in the intersection of the three circles (STS, AcRanker and PaCRISPR) in Figure 2A only make up a very small percentage $(1458/37\ \bar{2}89=3.9\%)$ of operons, but obviously represent the most confident predictions (Supplementary Table S1) in AcrDB. The taxonomy distribution of Acr-Aca operons of different confidence levels indicates that antiCRISPRs are widely distributed in 41 phyla of prokaryotes and viruses (Figure 2B and Supplementary Table S2). Specifically, Acr-Aca operons with Acr homologs are found in 12 phyla (first column of Figure 2B), Acr-Aca operons

The taxonomy distribution of Acr-Aca operons at the class level is available in Supplementary Figure S1 and Supplementary Table S3.  

# WEB DESIGN  

AcrDB is powered by PHP+MySQ $)\mathrm{L}{+}_{\mathit{i}}$ Apache2 $^+$ JavaScript. The web interface provides access to all the pre-computed data that were collected for Acr-Aca operons from 419, 5850 and 2044 genomes of Archaea, Bacteria, and Viruses, respectively. To browse the data (Figure 3A), users have three options:  

![](images/8d59dfae1cecd33aff899e7d45cc06c60e0fd7714d32f4b2c5c75f49449e7f77.jpg)  
Figure 3. Screenshots of AcrDB website to demonstrate its utilities. (A) Browse page allows three options to enter the database. The default is entry by CRISPR Cas Type. One can also click on Taxonomy for browsing by the NCBI Taxonomy tree, and click on Search to type in keywords and search different data fields. (B) Result page has different components to better organize the genome-specifi results. Ex mple sc enshots shown here are taken from this URL: http://bcb.unl.edu/AcrDB/anti crispr results.php?type $\mathrel{\mathop:}=$ ncbi&organism $\mathbf{\tau}_{1}=$ GCF 000569075 shows the default tabular view, where a large table is displayed. The table has 23 colum s and one can use mouse to move to othe page also shows a CRISPRCasFinder summary Table. B2.1 and B2.2 are n the same page and ca (B2.1) shows the graphic global view of the genome in a cir atio Differ ndicate their real size in the genome: the Acr-A cted with blue arcs, and the Cas loci positions local view (B2.2) or Jbrowse view (B3). In B2.2, each A its position in the genome. CRISPR–Cas arra ys are shown if they contain an STS and have an adja Cas locus $\mathrm{^{'}{<}10\ k b\ }$ ). The size of the CRISPR array and Cas loci is proportional to their real lengths.  

(i) By CRISPR–Cas types. This is for Bacteria and Archaea only. According to AcrFinder, Acr-Aca operons of prokaryotes must be from genomes with complete CRISPR–Cas systems (levels 3 and 4 of CRISPRCasFinder (28)). Therefore, CRISPR–Cas types of the genome were assigned to the Acr-Aca operons (see (22)).   
(ii) By Taxonomy. This is for Bacteria, Archaea and Viruses. Taxonomy lineages of all the genomes was retrieved from NCBI Taxonomy database.   
(iii) By Keyword search. This is for Bacteria, Archaea, and Viruses. Different query fields (e.g. RefSeq GCF ID or species name) are allowed to change and search. The input query can be autocompleted while the user is typing.  

The result page contains three pieces (Figure 3B1) of data from AcrFinder: guilt-by-association (GBA) result (operons containing Aca homologs), homology based result (operons containing Acr homologs), and CRISPRCasFinder result (to infer subtypes for Acr-Aca operons, and to identify STSs within AcrFinder pipeline, see (22)). The GBA data has been further organized to have three different views for better presentation:  

(i) Tabular view (Figure 3B1) provides a table with 23 columns including various information of the identified operons. Pre-computed data are gathered with different tools and organized for biologists to quickly look for interested targets, such as protein sequence, sequence length, isoelectric point, Aca HTH domain match, PaCRISPR score (bold if ${\tt>}0.5$ ), AcRanker rank/score (bold if score $>-5$ ), phage protein homologs, proximity to STSs, and taxonomy lineages.   
(ii) Graphic view (Figure 3B2) is designed only for Bacteria, because all bacterial genomes are completely assembled. Two component graphs are provided, one for a global view of the entire genome (shown as a circle as most bacterial genomes are circular (Figure 3B2.1)), and the other for a local view of Acr-Aca operons and CRISPR–Cas loci in a linear representation (Figure 3B2.2). For the global view, in the circular genome, various important sites/loci are indicated as different shapes (size not proportional to the real base pair length). It should be mentioned that a genome can contain multiple CRISPR–Cas loci and genomes do not contain STS are not shown in this global view. For the local view, in each Acr-Aca operon, each arrow represents a gene, and the arrow direction represents the strand, and the size of arrows is proportional to the real length of the gene. The CRISPR–Cas loci that contain self-targeting spacers (STSs) are also shown in this local view. To find the CRISPR array and Cas locus pair, the CRISPR array that contains STSs is located first, then look for neighboring Cas loci. If the distance between the CRISPR array and the neighboring Cas locus is larger than $10\mathrm{kb}$ , we do not show them.   
(iii) Jbrowse view (Figure 3B3) shows the genomic context  

of each Acr-Aca operon. Unlike the static global and local views, the Jbrowse view is dynamic, meaning one can use the menu and navigation icons of Jbrowse to zoom in or out and move the window to either directions. Nucleotide sequence of each gene and other RefSeq annotation data can be retrieved by clicking on each gene in this view.  

Additionally, we also provide a very detailed Help page to explain the website, and a Statistics page to allow users to quickly grab the data summary and navigate to important dataset (e.g. link to the most confident Acr-Aca operon or certain taxonomy groups). The Download page provides the flat files that are organized as different folders, as compressed archives, Fasta sequence files, or TSV text files, and can be batch downloaded conveniently. The links to our AcrFinder web server, PaCRISPR server, AcRanker server, and other related bioinformatics resources are also provided.  

# CONCLUSIONS  

AcrDB provides a collection of computationally predicted Acr-Aca operons that are present in $>7000$ RefSeq genomes of prokaryotes and their viruses. Among three existing databases (anti-CRISPRDB (19), CRISPRminer (20) and AcrCatalog (21)), anti-CRISPRDB and CRISPRminer collect experimentally characterized Acr proteins and their BLAST homologs, equivalent to AcrDB’s very small Acr homolog dataset (Table 2). AcrCatalog is more similar to AcrDB, as both focus on computationally predicted data.  

However, AcrDB differs from AcrCatalog in the following aspects, which can be considered as advantages of AcrDB: (i) AcrDB offers a more user-friendly web interface with various browsing, viewing in graphical representations, searching, and downloading options, while AcrCatalog does not provide any of these functions except for tabular browsing (http://acrcatalog.pythonanywhere.com/ catalog/); (ii) AcrDB contains a much larger data (37 289 Acr-Aca operons [total 99 648 proteins and 56 851 unique IDs] with Aca homologs, and 2477 Acr-Aca operons [total 4359 proteins and 1567 unique IDs] with Acr homologs) than AcrCatalog (16 919 Acr proteins of 2500 Acr families (21)); (iii) AcrDB features the genomic context of Acr and Aca homologs, while AcrCatalog focuses on clustering Acr proteins into sequence similarity-based families; and (iv) AcrDB collects data with three independent tools each having a unique data mining algorithm (AcrFinder: guilt-byassociation, STS, and gene neighborhood-based pipeline; AcRanker: amino acid $k$ -mer composition-based XGBoost classifier; PaCRISPR: evolutionary conservation in a form of Acr sequence alignment-based SVM classifier), while AcrCatalog uses a random forest (RF) classifier capturing eight Acr sequence features. The idea of using multiple tools for cross validation and performance improvement has been commonly used in genomic data science, and future development of AcrDB will consider further incorporate AcrCatalog standalone package and other new tools in our data collection pipeline.  

To conclude, AcrDB focuses on providing user-friendly access to computationally predicted Acr-Aca operons rather than experimentally characterized Acrs and homologs. All the three tools used for AcrDB data collection have been extensively evaluated in terms of their prediction performances in our recent papers (22–25). Various types of computational evidence are provided in a tabular view, e.g. Acr homology, Aca homology, AcRanker rank and score, PaCRISPR score, neighboring prophage genes and presence/absence of STSs in the genome. Graphical representation is also developed to view identified Acr-Aca operons, CRISPR–Cas loci, STS and their targets in the genome presented as a circle or as individual zoomed-in gene clusters. All pre-computed data are available through a batch download page, including AcrFinder GBA, Acr homology, AcRanker, PaCRISPR, and CRISPR–Cas results.  

# FUTURE WORK  

As acknowledged in our recent paper (23), AcrFinder has two limitations: (i) it requires Acrs be in the gene neighborhood of HTH-containing Acas, which will miss Acr proteins that do not need Aca regulators; and (ii) it requires Acrs be in prokaryotic genomes with complete CRISPR– Cas systems, which will fail to identify anti-CRISPRs in genomes with decayed/incomplete CRISPR–Cas systems or without CRISPR–Cas systems at all (possible according to (25)). Although we have purposely imposed these requirements in AcrFinder algorithm in order to reduce false positives, clearly these limitations will lead to false negatives and have been inherited by the current version of AcrDB. Both AcRanker and PaCRISPR have no such limitations; however, PaCRISPR is not designed for genome-scale Acr discovery due to its time-consuming PSSM building step, and AcRanker’s scores/ranks are not a good indicator of prediction confidence. For future development, we will continue to improve these programs by considering more Acr sequence features (e.g. protein 3D structure, protein charge and isoelectric point), and explore new machine learningbased algorithms that will address limitations of current programs.  

We plan to update AcrDB annually with newly characterized Acr and Aca proteins as well as our improved computational tools (AcrFinder, AcRanker, PaCRISPR and others). We will also include more genomes (not only complete but also draft genomes) and metagenomes in the discovery of Acr-Aca operons. AcrDB will complement existing antiCRISPR databases (Table 1), provide the largest collection of genome-wide Acr-Aca operons, and facilitate the experimental characterization of new Acr proteins and the development of safer CRISPR–Cas genome editing technologies.

# ABSTRACT  

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) together with bisulphite conversion allows the generation of whole genome methylation maps at single-cytosine resolution. This allows studying the absence of methylation in a particular genome region over a range of tissues, the differential tissue methylation or the changes occurring along pathological conditions. However, no database exists fully addressing such requirements. We propose here NGSmethDB (http://bioinfo2.ugr.es/NGSmethDB/gbrowse/) for the storage and retrieval of methylation data derived from NGS. Two cytosine methylation contexts (CpG and CAG/CTG) are considered. Through a browser interface coupled to a MySQL backend and several data mining tools, the user can search for methylation states in a set of tissues, retrieve methylation values for a set of tissues in a given chromosomal region, or display the methylation of promoters among different tissues. NGSmethDB is currently populated with human, mouse and Arabidopsis data, but other methylomes will be incorporated through an automatic pipeline as soon as new data become available. Dump downloads for three coverage levels (1, 5 or 10 reads) are available. NGSmethDB will be useful for experimental researchers, as well as for bioinformaticians, who might use the data as input for further research.  

# INTRODUCTION  

DNA methylation is a common epigenetic mark that can be found in eukaryotes exclusively at cytosine residues $(5^{\mathrm{me}}\mathrm{C})$ . This modification has important roles in embryonic development, as shown by early lethality in mice that lack DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), the inactivation of the X chromosome in female cells or the establishment and maintenance of allele-specific expression of imprinted genes (1–3). Numerous studies over the past decades suggest that cytosine DNA methylation functions to maintain the repressed chromatin state and therefore stably silence promoter activity (4). In animal genomes, the predominantly methylated sequence context is the dinucleotide $\mathrm{CpG}$ , while non-CpG methylation exists in plants that is targeted to transposable elements by a mechanism that depends upon small interfering RNAs (5). Recently, methylation at sequence contexts CHH and CHG has been detected in human undifferentiated cells (6).  

Many different techniques have been developed for DNA methylation profiling (7,8). The detection methods can be divided into a methylation-dependent pretreatment and an analytical step. The first step is necessary as $5^{\mathrm{me}}\mathrm{C}$ is not readily distinguished from unmethylated cytosine by hybridization-based methods and PCR amplification erases the DNA methylation information. Basically, three different pretreatments can be distinguished: enzyme digestion, affinity enrichment (immunoprecipiation) and sodium bisulphite conversion. The information on the DNA methylation is finally read out by a gel-based, array-based or sequencing-based analysis. Virtually, all combinations of these two steps exist. Depending on the specific combination used, we can distinguish between ‘single cytosine’ and ‘region wide’ profiling of methylation states. The region wide methods detect normally the methylation states of known CpG islands or unmethylated fragments using either enzyme digestion or immunoprecipitation. There are several drawbacks with these methods. Apart from the errors introduced by the methylation-dependent pretreatment, only ‘mean values’ of the regions can be detected. Although for many experiments it might be sufficient to get information whether a given region is methylated or unmethylated, for others it will be not. For example, recently it has been shown that many CpG islands show internal fluctuations that can be resolved by means of single-cytosine resolution analysis (9,10). Furthermore, single-cytosine resolution data can be critical to resolve the methylation states, and the possible functionality, of very small islands (islets) or even orphan CpG dinucleotides (10,11).  

However, to completely exploit the full potential of single-base resolution whole genome methylation maps, a specifically designed database is needed. Given the lack of single base data in the past, current databases are only focused either on specific regions and/or on pathologic situations (12,13).  

In the next years, however, whole genome methylation data will become available for many new tissues, pathological conditions and species and it will be of critical importance to store and unify this information in an adequate way. We therefore propose here NGSmethDB, a database for single-cytosine resolution methylation data. The database uses a web interface based on GBrowse (14) and coupled to a MySQL backend, which allows to visualize the methylation data in a genomic context together with many other annotations, as well as full data downloads. In addition, a set of powerful data mining tools are also implemented, so the user can filter, analyze and retrieve data in many different ways. For example, the user can search for unmethylated or differentially methylated cytosines in a selected set of tissues, or display and analyze the promoter methylation of RefSeq genes. Finally, the database extends the commonly used focus on CpG dinucleotides to the recently discovered non-CpG targets for DNA methylation in undifferentiated tissues (6).  

# FEATURES AND SCOPE  

The NGSmethDB database can be divided into two parts. First, the content can be visualized, together with many other common annotations, by means of a web interface based on GBrowse (14) coupled to a MySQL backend; and second, several user-friendly data mining tools are provided so the average user can generate its own data sets easily. Currently, the database holds information on three species (human, mouse and Arabidopsis) and 52 different tissues (21 unique tissues). Furthermore, two different methylation contexts are considered, CpG and CWG, but other non-CpG contexts, as CAH or CHH, will be soon available. Currently, the database holds methylation data of 696 599 217 cytosines for human (hg18), 69 459 481 cytosines for mouse (mm8) and 16 321 229 cytosines for Arabidopsis (TAIR8). A detailed and updated database statistical table is maintained on-line: http://bioinfo2.ugr .es/gbrowse2/StatGraphs/datasourcesrpt.php. A summary of the publications where the data were generated from is also maintained and updated on-line: http://bioinfo2.ugr .es/gbrowse2/DataSource/datasourcesrpt.php?start $=1$ .  

We encourage data submissions of new methylation data in order to populate and maintain updated NGSmethDB.  

For most data, the methylation information for the cytosines is directly available for the three mentioned genome assemblies. In these cases, we populate the database with these processed data. For other cases, we used the LiftOver tool (15) to convert the coordinates from other assemblies, or developed scripts to process the raw data (like fastaq files) in order to obtain the methylation information for all covered cytosines. All methylation values for both CpG and CWG contexts are calculated taking into account both strands. The assigned methylation value is therefore a weighted mean between the context in the direct and reverse strands. Which means that it is the sum of reads that indicate methylation (cytosine not converted to uracil/thymine) mapped to the specific position in the $\cdot_{+},$ strand and those mapped to the ‘ ’ strand, divided by the total number of reads mapped to the position regardless of the strand.  

# Genomic browser interface  

The GBrowse genome viewer (14) connected to a MySQL backend is used to set up a web browser interface for NGSmethDB. Features of the browser include the ability to scroll and zoom through arbitrary regions of a genome, to enter a region of the genome by searching for a landmark or performing a full text search of features, as well as the ability to enable and disable feature tracks and change their relative order and appearance. The user can also upload private annotations to view them in the context of the existing ones at the NGSmethDB web site. Apart from the methylation data, the following related annotations are currently available on the NGSmethDB browser: (i) CpGcluster CpG islands (16); (ii) Takai-Jones CpG islands (17); (iii) RefSeq genes (18); (iv) HMR conserved TFBSs (19); (v) CisRED regulatory elements (20); and (vi) the chromosome sequence (hg18, mm8 and TAIR8 genome assemblies) and $\mathrm{\bfG}+\mathrm{\bfC}$ content.  

The methylation information of a given context is represented by the coordinate of the cytosine on the direct strand. To display the methylation values of the cytosines we use a color gradient from white (methylation value $\mathbf{\varepsilon}=0$ , unmethylated in all reads) to red (methylation value $\mathbf{\Psi}=1$ , methylated in all reads). To demonstrate the usefulness of the web interface, we analyzed the promoter region of the gene TIAM1 (Figure 1). It can be seen that this promoter is differentially methylated among the different tissues.  

# Data mining tools  

Currently, five different ways are implemented to retrieve raw data from the database. For all five possibilities, two different sequence contexts and three coverage levels exist. We detected not just the methylation values of CpG dinucleotides but also for the cytosines in a CWG (CAG or CTG) context. The methylation value at a given position (cytosine) is calculated as explained before taking both strands into consideration. We stored three different coverage levels in the database: cytosines covered by at least 1, 5 and 10 reads.

Figure 1. Visualization of methylation states of $\mathrm{CpG}$ dinucleotides in different tissues in the NGSmethDB genome browser. The promoter region of the gene TIAM1 (NM_003253) is shown. The different methylation values are displayed by means of a color gradient from white (unmethylated in all reads) toward red (methylated in all reads).  

# Dump download  

This option shows first an overview of current database content, including a short description of the tissue, the genome coverage in $\%$ , a link to PubMed, and raw data files for $\#\mathrm{read}\geq1$ , $\#\mathrm{read}\geq5$ and $\#\mathrm{read}\geq10$ coverage. The files show the chromosome, chromosome-start and chromosome-end coordinates, the sequence methylation context (either $\mathrm{CpG}$ or CWG), the number of reads and the cytosine methylation ratio.  

# Retrieve unmethylated contexts  

This tool can be used to retrieve all unmethylated cytosines in a given set of tissues. The user has to select the sequence context (CG or CWG), the read coverage, the threshold for unmethylation (often a threshold of 0.2 is used, i.e. all cytosines with values $\leq0.2$ are considered to be unmethylated) and the tissues. The tool will detect all cytosine contexts showing lower methylation ratios than the chosen threshold in all selected tissues. The provided output file holds the chromosome, chromosome start- and end-coordinates and the methylation values in all selected tissues. Note that this tool can be also used to retrieve all CpGs which are present in every single analyzed tissue by setting the threshold to one. In doing so, cytosines with methylation data in all tissues will be reported regardless of its methylation state, i.e. cytosines that are not covered by at least the number of chosen coverage threshold (1, 5 or 10) in any of the analyzed tissues will not be reported in the output.  

# Retrieve differentially methylated contexts  

By means of this tool all differentially methylated cytosine contexts can be determined in a given set of tissues. All parameters of the ‘Retrieve unmethylated contexts’ (see above) are available here, plus one additional parameter: the threshold for the methylation value which defines whether a cytosine is considered to be methylated (often a threshold of 0.8 is used, i.e. all cytosines with higher values than $\ge0.8$ are considered to be methylated). We define a cytosine as differentially methylated if it is unmethylated in at least one tissue and methylated in at least one other tissue. The tool reports those differentially methylated cytosine contexts that are either methylated or unmethylated in all analyzed tissues, i.e. those contexts that show intermediate methylation in only one tissue will not be reported.  

# Get methylation states of promoter regions  

This tool allows depicting the methylation states of all cytosine contexts within the promoter region of RefSeq genes. We define the promoter region as beginning $1.5\mathrm{kb}$ upstream of the Transcription Start Site (TSS) and ending 500 bp downstream of the TSS. The user needs to provide a valid RefSeq name $(\mathrm{NM}_{-}^{\mathrm{~*}})$ or a unique TAIR gene id (ATxGxxxxx) and the desired coverage. The output is displayed by default as an overview table that summarizes the fluctuation along the promoter as well as over the different tissues. A detailed table can also be generated (Figure 2).  

# Retrieve methylation data for chromosome region  

All methylation values for a selected set of tissues can be retrieved for a given chromosomal region, once the user provides the start and end chromosome coordinates.  

# CONCLUSIONS  

Over the next years, methylation data for a growing number of tissues, cell types, pathological conditions and diverse species will all be available. In most of the original publications, the authors focus on concrete questions and scarcely the whole potential of the data can be exploited. To get more out of these data, a joint analysis with data from other tissues and/or species is needed. To carry out such analysis, data must be first stored in an appropriate way in a database. We propose here NGSmethDB, a new database with a very broad scope to facilitate the analysis of methylation data from different sources. Heterogeneous methylation data can be either simultaneously visualized through a powerful web interface or selectively downloaded by means of the provided data mining tools that allow the user to design new experiments and retrieve exactly the adequate data for them. Thus, we are confident that the database will be of great usefulness both for experimental and bioinformatics researchers.

# ABSTRACT  

With the growing number of experimentally resolved structures of macromolecular complexes, it becomes clear that the interactions that involve protein structures are mediated not only by the protein domains, but also by various non-structured regions, such as interdomain linkers, or terminal sequences. Here, we present DOMMINO (http:// dommino.org), a comprehensive database of macromolecular interactions that includes the interactions between protein domains, interdomain linkers, N- and C-terminal regions and protein peptides. The database complements SCOP domain annotations with domain predictions by SUPERFAMILY and is automatically updated every week. The database interface is designed to provide the user with a three-stage pipeline to study macromolecular interactions: (i) a flexible search that can include a PDB ID, type of interaction, SCOP family of interacting proteins, organism name, interaction keyword and a minimal threshold on the number of contact pairs; (ii) visualization of subunit interaction network, where the user can investigate the types of interactions within a macromolecular assembly; and (iii) visualization of an interface structure between any pair of the interacting subunits, where the user can highlight several different types of residues within the interfaces as well as study the structure of the corresponding binary complex of subunits.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Interactions mediated by proteins play a crucial role in many cellular processes (1). An important step toward a mechanistic description of these processes is the structural analysis and modeling of these interactions and their interaction interfaces. Today, experimental and computational methods can routinely provide an increasing number of high-resolution structures of the binary and higher order complexes (2). These complexes are collected into databases, the interactions that formed the complexes are grouped based on their structures and functions and their important features are analyzed.  

Currently, there are a number of open access structural databases containing structure of the protein–protein interactions and/or interaction interfaces extracted from RCSB Protein Data Bank [PDB, (3)] and Protein Quaternary Server [PQS, (4)]. Among the most popular and recent databases are 3DComplex (5), 3DID (6), DOMINE (7), iPfam (8), PIBASE (9), PSIBASE (10), SCOPPI (11), SNAPPI-DB (12). Most of the databases focus on the interactions between the protein domains. To define domains they employ either sequence-based or structure-based domain classification definitions, such as SCOP (13), CATH (14) and PFAM (15). Often, the interactions are further classified based on structural or physico-chemical features of their interfaces or based on the function of the corresponding interaction partners. For instance, SCOPPI classifies the interactions within each SCOP family according to the geometric features of the interface structures (11). Another database, 3DID uses gene ontology functional annotation to characterize the extracted domain–domain (6). Finally, some databases, such as PIBASE and 3DID, have the ability to visualize the network of interacting proteins or their domains. The reliance on the structural classification of proteins when characterizing an interaction is important, however, the protein interaction databases that employ structural classifications are often dependent on how frequent a classification definition is updated. As a result, many interaction databases are updated on the annual basis or less frequently, while the current rate of protein-mediated complexes growth in PDB is hundreds of structures each month.  

Another common feature of many structural databases on protein interactions is that they focus on the interactions between either protein domains or single-domain proteins. While this covers a significant part of protein-mediated macromolecular interactions, other types of interactions exist. There are a few databases that focus on the interactions that occur between a protein and a peptide (16,17). For instance, a database with a name similar to ours, DOMINO, curates ${>}3900$ such interactions from literatures and is able to display the interaction networks (16). Another database, PepX, stores 1431 representations of PDB entries containing protein–peptide interactions and clusters them into 505 clusters (17).  

In addition to the interactions mediated by protein domains and peptides, the interactions mediated by the unstructured protein regions such as $C^{-}$ and $\mathbf{N}$ -termini, as well as interdomain linkers are often considered as independent functional (and structural) regions of a protein, since they have been known to carry out important protein functions (18–20). For instance, the functions of N-termini include ubiquitination-induced degradation and protein sorting, while C-termini are associated with signaling and translation termination (19). Most importantly, the protein termini have been often found to interact with other proteins, with the examples ranging from the interactions between C-termini and multidomain scaffold proteins (21) to the interactions between N-termini and integral membrane proteins (22). The other functionally important regions of the multidomain proteins, interdomain linkers, are often less conserved than the neighboring domains and have been found to underlie a wide range of functions (20,23). The less-studied linker–protein interactions have been associated with the regulation of kinase activity (24) and allosteric communication (25). The datasets of individual unstructured regions have been collected and analyzed (26–29), however, a systematic collection and analysis of the structures of their interactions is yet to be done.  

Here, we introduce DOMMINO, a Database Of Macro-Molecular INteractiOns that currently houses ${>}500000$ binary interactions mediated by proteins. By analysis of the existing databases, several important features have been integrated into DOMMINO. First, it is fully automated is designed to update itself on a weekly basis, followed by the weekly PDB update. Second, it has an expanded coverage of types of interactions: in addition to storing domain–domain and domain–peptide interactions traditionally considered by the macromolecular interaction databases, DOMMINO includes the interactions mediated by the unstructured regions, such as interdomain linkers, N-terminal and C-terminal regions. Third, the database has an expanded coverage of structural domains by integrating the manual annotation of protein domains participating in the interactions using the latest version of SCOP (13) with the automated annotation using SUPERFAMILY (30). Finally, the web-interface is designed to provide the researcher with a pipeline to study the interactions: from a flexible search to the subunit interaction networks to the individual interaction interfaces.  

# METHODS  

There are six types of subunits that form interactions in DOMMINO: a protein domain, interdomain linker (or simply linker), C-terminal region, N-terminal region, peptide and an undefined chain. The subunit types are defined, and the binary interactions are annotated via the following three stages of data processing (Figure 1). First, we determine all protein domains and extract their coordinates by combining domain definitions manually curated by SCOP and domain predictions by a Hidden Markov Model based approach. Second, using the above domain annotations we determine all interdomain linkers and terminal regions of the proteins and extract their coordinates. Finally, we extract the coordinates of protein peptides and undefined protein chains.  

# Data sources and preprocessing  

DOMMINO integrates the information from multiple sources. The structural data on macromolecular interactions are extracted from PDB (3); the atomic coordinates are processed (ATOM and HETATM records) for each PDB structure with at least one protein chain. If a PDB entry has more than one structure model, the first model is used in the database’s current implementation. For domain assignment, the most recent release (June 2009) of manually curated SCOP database is used that includes the manual annotation for 38 221 PDB entries. The SCOP domain definitions are extracted from file dir.cla.scop.txt. During the domain assignment, each PDB structure is assigned to one of two groups as follows. If a PDB structure has at least one assigned SCOP protein domain, according to the SCOP definition file, the structure is assigned to the first group, otherwise it is assigned to the second group of macromolecular complexes for which the constituting domains are later predicted using SUPERFAMILY software (30) (‘Domain annotation’ section).  

# Domain annotation  

Out of 110 800 SCOP protein domain definitions extracted from file dir.cla.scop.txt, a slightly reduced set of 109 942 definitions is employed for the first group of PDB structures, because some SCOP domains cannot be located in the coordinate records of the PDB files from the current PDB release. The definitions are stored as a new parsable file filtered.cla.scop.txt, in which the same data format as in dir.cla.scop.txt is used.  

To assign protein domains for the PDB structures from the second group, for which no SCOP annotation is available, SUPERFAMILY software is used (30). The software is designed to accurately predict the SCOP domains based on a sequence of each protein chain. It employs a collection of hidden Markov models (HMMs) each corresponding to a structural protein domain at the SCOP family level. The prediction is done by scanning a protein sequence against the HMMs and is accepted when  

![](images/3e4493f4fd59fb87590ae2ca17fd4785f566a5be17935bb9ba4e3e767b782cb5.jpg)  
Figure 1. Data processing in DOMMINO. Data processing consists of three stages: (1) determining protein domains, (2) determining inter-domain linkers and terminal protein regions and (3) determining protein peptides and unlabeled protein chains. During each stage, the coordinates of subunits of each type are collected and the corresponding interactions are annotated.  

$E$ -value $\underline{{<}}0.01$ . In the current version of DOMMINO, we do not predict domains spanning multiple chains in a PDB structure. When two predicted domains overlap, we evenly distribute the overlapping region between the two predicted domains. As a result, 101 389 domains were predicted for the PDB files from the second group, and their coordinates were extracted. The information on predicted domains, including the corresponding regions and the SCOP classification, is summarized in a parsable file pre.cla.scop.txt.  

# Locating linkers, C-terminal and N-terminal regions  

A predicted SCOP domain can be either a whole protein chain or its fragment. A domain annotated by SCOP can also consist of more than one fragment of a protein chain. Each protein fragment that does not belong to any protein domain is then annotated as a linker, Cor N-terminus, depending on whether it is surrounded by two domain fragments or there is just one domain fragment located to the right or to the left of it, correspondingly. For each defined region, its coordinates are also extracted.  

# Determining peptides and undefined chains  

There are chains in PDB files that cannot be annotated by assigning domain using either SCOP definitions or prediction by SUPERFAMILY. Based on how long such protein chains, they are classified as either peptides or undefined chains. Specifically, we use a 20-residue threshold to determine a peptide (if the number of residues is ${<}20{\it\Delta\phi}$ ) and undefined chain (otherwise). The same threshold has been used before in ASTRAL, a similar domain definition protocol (31).  

# Determining protein interfaces  

For each PDB structure, each pair of determined subunits of the above six types is analyzed to determine whether they interact with each other using the following definition. If any atom of a residue in one protein subunit is within $6\mathring\mathrm{A}$ of any atom of a residue in another protein subunit, the two residues are determined as the contact pair residues. Each of the residues belongs to the corresponding protein binding site for the respective subunit. When determining an intrachain interaction between two protein subunits that are sequentially adjacent to each other, the distance of the C-terminal residue of the first subunit can be potentially closer than $6\mathring\mathrm{A}$ to the N-terminal residue of the second subunit, while these residues do not contribute to the interaction. To exclude such cases, a pair of residues from the same chain but belonging to different adjacent subunits is not recorded as a contact pair if these residues are $<10$ residues apart. Finally, DOMMINO allows the user to apply different threshold levels on the number of contact pairs to exclude potential artifactual interactions (the default threshold is 10 contact pairs).  

# DATABASE CONTENT AND MAINTENANCE  

The content of DOMMINO includes both intrachain and interchain interactions between a pair of subunits of any of the six types. After the current update (August, 2011) the database has ${\sim}514000$ entries (that is, all binary interactions sharing at least one contact pair), ${\sim}146000$ of which are determined using the SCOP domain definitions and ${\sim}368000$ using domain predictions by SUPERFAMILY. The database has larger number of interchain $(\sim57.3\%)$ than intrachain interactions. Approximately $47.7\%$ of all interactions are domain– domain interactions, with the interactions between a domain and a C-terminus being the second most populated type of interaction $(\sim18.5\%)$ and the interactions between a domain and a peptide being the third most populated type $(\sim17.2\%)$ . Interestingly, all 21 possible types of interactions in DOMMINO are populated with the interaction structures. Combined, the interactions mediated by the unstructured protein regions (i.e. linkers and termini) comprise ${\sim}47.6\%$ of all interactions. There are 8751 $(\sim1.7\%)$ interactions between two different species. The interaction data in DOMMINO is organized as a relational database that supports the web-based search functions.  

In order to be fully synchronized with the current release of PDB, DOMMINO and the corresponding file system are automatically updated every week following the PDB’s weekly updating schedule. During the weekly update of PDB, some older entries could be deleted from the current release as erroneous or outdated while, new entries could be added. The PDB log file that records the deleted entries and new added entries is used to first flag the deleted entries in DOMMINO. Then, the new added PDB entries are processed. If a PDB ID of new added PDB entry does not exist in DOMMINO, the entire three-stage processing (‘Methods’ section) is applied for this PDB entry to obtain the interaction data. When the PDB entry is present in the database, we remove the old PDB entry first and all related data from DOMMINO, before adding the entry with the same PDB ID.  

# USER INTERFACE  

A web-based interface that relies on the DOMMINO is developed for investigating protein-mediated interactions (Figure 2A). The web-based interface includes four basic features: (i) search query, (ii) retrieval of results, (iii) visualization of the subunit interaction network for a PDB structure and (iv) visualization of the structure either of the interaction complex or of the interaction interface for a selected binary interaction. All these stages are integrated together into a single workflow to facilitate the structure-based analysis of protein-mediated interactions.  

# Search query and PDB list of result  

The user can retrieve data in three different ways: (i) basic search, (ii) advanced search and (iii) data browsing and downloading. When the user aims to investigate a protein interaction for a specific PDB entry, they can choose the simple search option and enter entering a PDB ID. In simple search, the threshold on the minimal number of contact pairs is set to 10. The advanced search option makes the search more flexible using four criteria options including interaction type (e.g. domain to domain, domain to linker, undefined chain to C-terminal), SCOP family, organism name and keyword. The keyword includes a description of a target protein molecule, e.g. ‘PEPTIDE ARYLATION ENZYME’. The user can combine these criteria creating a more complex and therefore more focused search query. In advanced search, the user can setup a different contact pair threshold. For data browsing, we list all possible interaction types. If the user selects a type of interaction mediated by at least one domain (e.g. D–D or D–C), they will be prompted to choose a SCOP family for the interacting domain(s). Otherwise, the web server retrieves the entire PDB ID list for the selected type of interactions. When the user submits a search query, the web server will retrieve a list of PDB entries containing the queried protein interactions (see Figure 2B, for an example).  

# Interaction network  

The web-based search tool of DOMMINO provides the means to visualize the interaction network between the subunits of a PDB entry from the retrieved results (see Figure 2C, for an example of the interaction network for PDB ID 2HTK). In the network includes all subunits from a PDB entry, irrespective whether or not they participate in the interactions. Edges are used to connect two interacting subunits. Six geometric shapes are implemented to represent the six types of protein subunits. Subunit nodes from the same chain are represented with the same color. The label in a subunit node indicates the chain this subunit belongs to, and the sequential order of the subunit in the chain. The complete description of the shapes and colors used in the network can be retrieved by clicking the help button just below the network image.  

# Structure visualization  

By selecting two interacting subunits from the subunit interaction network, the user can visualize the structure of the complex and its binding sites or select to show the interaction interface only, using a Jmol-based tool (32). The Jmol-based web tool provides four molecular representation options including default (ball-and-stick), ribbon, backbone and surface representations to view the structure of the interaction complex, its interfaces, or its binding sites (Figure 2D). In addition, the user can highlight by different colors the important physicochemical properties of the residues, such as hydrophobicity, charge, etc.  

# DISCUSSION  

In this work, we presented a new database that combines the interactions between the structural subunits of six different types. The database interface provides the user with a three-stage pipeline to study macromolecular interactions including a flexible search, visualization of subunit interaction network, as well as visualization of an interface structure between any pair of the interacting subunits. In addition to its weekly updates, DOMMINO will automatically update the SCOP domain definitions when the new definitions become available. Our next future step is to include to DOMMINO the interactions mediated by other macromolecules, such as DNAs and RNAs.

# ABSTRACT  

Since the migrations that led humans to colonize Earth, our species has faced frequent adaptive challenges that have left signatures in the landscape of genetic variation and that we can identify in our today’s genomes. Here, we (i) perform an outlier approach on eight different population genetic statistics for 22 non-admixed human populations of the Phase III of the 1000 Genomes Project to detect selective sweeps at different historical ages, as well as events of recurrent positive selection in the human lineage; and (ii) create PopHumanScan, an online catalog that compiles and annotates all candidate regions under selection to facilitate their validation and thoroughly analysis. Well-known examples of human genetic adaptation published elsewhere are included in the catalog, as well as hundreds of other attractive candidates that will require further investigation. Designed as a collaborative database, PopHumanScan aims to become a central repository to share information, guide future studies and help advance our understanding of how selection has modeled our genomes as a response to changes in the environment or lifestyle of human populations. PopHumanScan is open and freely available at https://pophumanscan.uab.cat.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Since the split with chimpanzees, and especially since the migrations that led humans to colonize almost every single place on Earth, our species has faced frequent environmental and social changes that have shaped the variation patterns of our genomes through the action of natural selection (1). These environmental challenges include, for example, extreme cold temperatures in much of the Americas and Eurasia during the last ice age, limiting exposure to sunlight as we moved to higher latitudes or contact with new pathogens. Part of the incorporated genetic innovations may have been introgressed from archaic hominins that left Africa before us, including Neanderthals and Denisovans, with whom we encountered and interbred before they got extinct. Around $1-6\%$ of any modern non-African human genome can be traced back to the genomes of these archaic populations (2). Another dramatic change occurred within the past $10~000$ years coinciding with the transition from a hunting-gathering lifestyle to farming. Selection pressures for adapting to large settlements and new diets favored genetic variants associated with innate immune response, fatty acid metabolic efficiency, and lactose tolerance, among others (3).  

These selection pressures left signatures in the landscape of genetic variation that can be identified in our today’s genomes (4). Starting from single-locus studies to the first large-scale catalogs of genetic variation (5–8), dozens of targets of positive selection have been identified, providing important insights into recent human evolutionary history (3,9,10). Even though genome-wide HapMap genotyping data is able to disentangle the effects of demography and selection better than single-locus approaches, it still has the problem of ascertainment bias, which may alter the site frequency spectrum (SFS) of analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (11). The availability of the most comprehensive worldwide nucleotide variation dataset so far from the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) (12,13), based on whole-genome re-sequencing, provides the human lineage with an abundant, ascertained variation dataset on which to test molecular population genetics hypotheses and eventually pinpoint targets of positive selection in one or more human populations that escape from the background evolutionary dynamics of genetic variation (14).  

To gain deeper understanding of how environmental and social challenges have shaped our genomes through the action of natural selection, here we (i) perform a genomewide scan of selection on the latest version of the 1000GP data by surveying distinctive signatures of genomic variation left by different selective events, and (ii) create an online catalog of all candidate genomic regions under selection to facilitate their validation and thorough analysis. As far as we are concerned, dbPSHP (15) is the only previous online database that compiles putative positively selected loci in human evolution. In their case, regions were extracted from curated publications based on genotyping data––instead of whole-genome re-sequencing data––of the HapMap III (8) and the 1000GP Pilot 1 (12), and the last update is reported as far as May 2014. On the other hand, after the publication of the 1000 Genomes Selection Browser 1.0 (16), Pybus et al. developed a machine-learning framework––Hierarchical Boosting––that combines the results of multiple tests for detecting positive selection to classify genomic regions into different selection regimes (17). They analyzed within-species polymorphism data for three populations of the 1000GP Phase I (12), and the resulting scores were made available as UCSC Hub Tracks. Here, we perform an outlier approach on the greatest number of population genetic statistics and sampled populations available so far. This genome-wide scan of selection is able to detect sweeps at different historical ages, as well as evidence of recurrent selection in the human lineage since the split between our species and chimpanzees. Results have been made available in a collaborative, online database, $P o$ - pHumanScan, which is aimed at compiling and annotating adaptation events along the human evolutionary history. Well-known examples of human genetic adaptation published elsewhere are included in the catalog, as well as hundreds of other attractive candidates that will require a more thoroughly analysis. PopHumanScan graphically represents each signature of selection within the empirical distributions of the corresponding DNA diversity statistic across populations. It also provides structural and functional annotations of the region, links to external databases and cross-references to 268 publications.  

# POPHUMANSCAN ANALYSIS PIPELINE  

We have designed and implemented a custom pipeline (Figure 1) to perform a genome-wide scan of selection. Specifically, the pipeline processes eight different neutrality tests calculated either in sliding windows along the genome or for each protein-coding gene, for 22 non-admixed human populations. The genomic regions identified should show signatures that are compatible with natural selection having driven the evolution of the region at one or different timescales, from recent selective sweeps to recurrent selection since the split between our species and chimpanzees. These candidate regions under selection are further characterized with structural and functional annotations of that particular region. Furthermore, 268 articles reporting evidences of natural selection in genomic regions and genes using different statistical methods have been manually curated and cross-referenced to the candidate regions detected with our pipeline.  

# Pre-processing of the PopHuman data  

Population genomic data were retrieved from PopHuman (18) for 22 non-admixed populations of the Phase III of the 1000GP (13) (Supplementary Table S1), mapped to GRCh37/hg19. Specifically, values for seven different neutrality tests have been obtained for each population in 186 549 10-kb non-overlapping sliding windows along the autosomes and the X chromosome (Figure 1). In addition, the McDonald and Kreitman test (MKT) (19), as well as the proportion of substitutions that are adaptive $(\alpha)$ (20,21), were calculated on the protein-coding genes overlapping the candidate regions under selection identified with the other seven statistics and that showed some variability in both polymorphism and divergence, according to gene annotations from GENCODE release 27 (22) and PopHuman polymorphism and divergence data (Figure 1). MKTderived calculations were performed using the R package iMKT (https://github.com/BGD-UAB/iMKT; last accessed: February 2018). In total, eight different neutrality tests were performed. They identify different types of signatures that remain visible in the genomic sequences for a timescale ranging from few thousands of years after a single sweep selection event to several million years for the case of recurrent selection (4,23).  

Linkage Disequilibrium $(L D)$ . Selection signatures in the LD, e.g. long haplotypes, were detected using two complementary measures: iHS (24) and XP-EHH (9). iHS has good power to detect selective sweeps with haplotypes at moderate frequency $(50\text{\textperthousand}$ , while $X P–E H H$ is more powerful for detecting selective sweeps when the selected haplotype has a frequency ${>}80\%$ . In the case of XP-EHH, which analyzes pairs of populations, only pairs CEU-YRI, CEU-CHB and YRI-CHB were considered, and the population showing the evidence of selection was identified with the locus-specific branch length method (LSBL) (25). These long-range haplotypes persist for relatively short periods of type, typically up to ${\sim}30\mathrm{kya}$ , and thus this signature allows us to identify recent selection events only (4).  

Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS). Five statistics have been considered: four are based on both the allele frequency spectrum and the levels of variability––Fay and Wu’s $H(26)$ , Fu and Li’s $D$ and $F(27)$ , and Tajima’s $D$ (28)––, and the other one is based on population differentiation–– ${\bf\nabla}\cdot{\bf\nabla}F_{S T}$ (29,30)– Fay and Wu’s $H$ detects an excess of high-frequency derived SNPs, compatible with an incomplete sweep or recombination breaking swept linked SNPs. Fu and Li’s $D$ and $F$ and Tajima’s $D$ assess the lack or excess of rare alleles (or singletons). Lack of rare alleles is compatible with balancing selection, while an excess is normally explained by either positive or weakly deleterious selection. $F_{S T}$ detects populationspecific selective events that changed the genetic composition of the affected population. It analyzes pairs of populations. The pairs CEU-YRI, CEU-CHB and YRI-CHB were considered, and the population showing the evidence of selection was identified with the LSBL (25). SFS signatures can persist in the genomes for a longer period than LD, and thus selective events identified by shifts in the SFS might have occurred up to ${\sim}80$ kya (4).  

Protein changes. Recurrent selection since the split between our species and chimpanzees $\mathrm{(<6~mya)}$ is detected using a test based on comparisons of polymorphism and divergence––MKT (19)––, and the result of the test is summarized with the estimator $\alpha$ (20,21). For this calculation, we used an MKT-based methodology that corrects for the presence of non-synonymous slightly deleterious segregating sites in order to avoid underestimating $\alpha$ (31).

Figure 1. PopHumanScan pipeline. Starting from population genomic data retrieved from PopHuman, 8 different neutrality tests are analyzed in 22 non-admixed human populations (or 3 population pairs). Tests are color-coded depending on the type of signature they are able to detect: Linkage Disequilibrium $(L D)$ , Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS) and Protein Changes. The significance of each test is assessed either with a Fisher’s exact test or a rank score, for each of the 22 populations (or 3 population pairs) independently, and independently for autosomes and the X chromosome. Finally, candidate regions under selection are structurally and functionally annotated, and cross-referenced with 268 publications.  

# Genome-wide scan of selection  

For the parameter $\alpha$ of MKT, evidence of positive selection for protein-coding genes was inferred when $\alpha>0$ and the Fisher’s Exact Test for the $2\times2$ MKT contingency table was significant ( $P$ -value $<0.05$ ) (Figure 1). Because the other seven selection statistics have not been associated with a simple parametric distribution, candidate windows under selection were identified as the most extreme values (within the $0.05\%$ tail) in the corresponding empirical distribution. These empirical distributions were performed independently for each of the 22 populations (or three population pairs in the case of $X P$ -EHH and $F_{S T,}$ ), and independently for the autosomes and the X chromosome (to account for different demographic histories and the different effective population size of the autosomes compared to the X chromosome; chromosome Y was not analyzed). In total, 116 empirical distributions were obtained for autosomal regions, and 91 for the X chromosome (data of iHS and $X P–E H H$ was not available for the X chromosome in PopHuman) (Figure 1).  

From the initial 186 549 10-kb non-overlapping windows from PopHuman for each population and statistic, those containing ${<}5$ segregating sites were discarded $(<0.2\%)$ (Supplementary Figure S1). Then, an empirical $P$ -value was assigned to each of the remaining windows for each of the 116 combinations of population (or population pair) and statistic, separately for the autosomes as a whole and the X chromosome. Specifically, for each window $i$ in a population (or population pair), $p$ is the quantile of that window for statistic $j$ , that is, its empirical $P$ -value. In the case of Tajima’s $D$ , Fu and Li’s $D$ and $F.$ , and Fay and Wu’s $H_{\sun}$ two-tailed $P$ -values were calculated. Once the significance for each individual 10-kb window in the genome was assessed, a candidate region under selection was defined as being a contiguous genomic region containing at least one 10-kb significant window ( $P$ -value $<0.0005$ ) and spanning adjacent windows with $P$ -values $<0.005$ (Supplementary Figure S2). In addition, this region may span stretches ${<}20$ - kb of contiguous nucleotides not analyzed in PopHuman (i.e. because they contain non-accessible bases according to the Pilot-style Accessibility Mask of the 1000GP (13,18)). This outlier approach was designed to face the unique features and limitations of our PopHuman source data and to be highly conservative defining candidate regions under selection. We expect that it likely results in an enriched set of genomic regions that have been targets of natural selection along the human evolutionary history (11), and refer to the outlier regions as candidate regions showing signatures of selection.  

Once candidate selected regions (or genes) were assigned for the 22 populations (or three population pairs) and eight statistics, they were collapsed according to their coordinates into a joint set of 2879 candidate regions under selection genome-wide. Of these, 20 regions were removed because they were completely located in DAC Blacklisted regions (i.e. regions of the reference genome which are troublesome for high throughput sequencing aligners) or partially overlapped genomic gaps, as obtained from the UCSC (32). Therefore, a total of 2859 regions were finally considered.  

# Structural and functional annotations  

The final 2859 candidate regions under selection were structurally and functionally characterized according to 15 different annotations categorized into five groups, extracted from the UCSC (32) and two publicly available databases (33,34) (Figure 1).  

Sequencing. (i) Mappability was assessed as the percentage of bases in the region that do not present any troublesome to high-throughput sequencing aligners according to the DAC Blacklisted regions of the UCSC (35). (ii) Distance to closest $G A P$ was computed as the distance (in Mb) to the closest gap (32).  

Regulation. (iii) CpG Islands (36), (iv) Vista Enhancers (37), (v) Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs) (32) and (vi) ORegAnno Regulatory Elements (38) were computed as the total number of elements contained in the region, as well as the number of SNPs contained in the overlapping elements.  

Comparative genomics. Evolutionary conservation of the regions was assessed by considering the results of three different algorithms––phastCons, PhyloP and GERP––on the multiple alignments of the genomes of 100 vertebrate species (39). (vii) PhyloP Evolutionary Conservation and (viii) GERP Constrained Elements were assessed as the percentage of bases in the region that have a score ${>}2$ for the given statistic (i.e. constrained sites) (32). (ix) phastCons Evolutionary Conservation was calculated as the percentage of bases that overlap phastCons conserved elements (32).  

Structural variation. (x) InvFEST Inversions (34), (xi) DGV Structural Variants (40), (xii) RepeatMasker (41), (xiii) Segmental Duplications (42) and (xiv) TRF Simple Tandem Repeats (43) were assessed as the percentage of bases in the region that overlap these genomic elements.  

Archaic introgression. (xv) Archaic introgression was assessed as the percentage of bases in the region that overlap either Neanderthal or Denisova introgressed haplotypes (33).  

# Published references  

A total of 268 publications from 1954 to 2018 reporting either specific loci or multiple regions from a genomewide scan of selection in the human genome were crossreferenced with our final 2859 candidate regions under selection (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table S2). Of these, 132 publications were directly extracted from the dbPSHP database (15), while the other 136 were manually curated here. Exhaustive information from the main text and/or supplementary figures and tables was extracted for each reported loci, including the genomic coordinates, affected population(s), statistic(s), type of selection and PubMed ID. Genomic coordinates were lifted over to GRCh37/hg19 using the LiftOver tool of the UCSC (32), or deduced from protein-coding gene location, if necessary.

# OVERVIEW OF THE POPHUMANSCAN ONLINE CATALOG  

In addition to the exhaustive genome-wide selection scan that has been performed, we have also created PopHumanScan, a collaborative, online database that is aimed at compiling and annotating adaptation events along the human evolutionary history (Figure 2). PopHumanScan reports each evidence of selection with the empirical distributions of the corresponding DNA diversity statistic across the human genome and among populations, structural and functional annotations of the region, links to external databases, as well as cross-references to 268 publications.  

# Implementation  

PopHumanScan is currently running under Apache on a CentOS 7.2 Linux x64 server with 16 Intel Xeon $2.4\:\mathrm{GHz}$ processors and 32 GB RAM. It is mainly built on PHP as backend framework. It also includes AJAX for specific file requests and MySQL for data storage. The client-side is build on JavaScript and uses several JavaScript libraries, including jQuery, the jQuery plugin DataTables and Plotly.js, as well as a custom Bootstrap 4 framework.  

# The PopHumanScan catalog  

Main table. All 2859 candidate regions under selection are displayed as rows in an interactive table (Figure 2, left). The information displayed in each row includes: (i) the genomic coordinates of the candidate locus, (ii) genes contained in or partially overlapping the region (if any), (iii) the most extreme value for each of the eight statistics considered (i.e. most extreme value in any 10-kb window included in the region, for any population or population pair; green (positive) and red (negative) values are outliers ( $P<$ 0.0005) in the corresponding empirical distribution), (iv) color-coded dots depicting different types of selection signatures (i.e. LD, $0$ SFS and/or $0$ Protein Changes), (v) color-coded dots depicting the meta-population(s) that show signatures of selection (i.e. $\textcircled{\scriptsize{1}}$ Europe (EUR), $\cdot$ Africa (AFR), $\textcircled{\scriptsize{1}}$ South-Asia (SAS) and/or $\bullet$ East-Asia $(E A S)\}$ and (vi) the source that contributed the candidate region under selection. At the time of writing, all 2859 regions came uniquely from our genome-wide selection scan (i.e. source labeled as PopHumanScan), but additional data sources by contributors from the scientific community are expected once PopHumanScan is published (see next section). By clicking the $\oplus$ icon at the beginning of each row, detailed information of the particular candidate region under selection is displayed, including the values for all significant statistics in all target populations (or population pairs) and an overview of the main structural and functional annotations and cross-referenced publications (i.e. non-gray buttons represent overlapping annotations or cross-referenced publications), as well as access to the complete report for the corresponding candidate region under selection. At last, several filters are available at the bottom of the page to narrow the search.  

Complete report. A complete report for each candidate region can be accessed from the main table (Figure 2, right). The first section of the report displays all the structural and functional annotations of the region, together with links to external databases: (i) PopHuman (18), which complements the population genomics information; (ii) HaploReg (44), which allows the exploration of evolutionary conservation, expression eQTSs, epigenomic data and regulatory annotations; and (iii) Ensembl (45), which allows the exploration of the LD of the region, among others. The second section lists all the genes contained in or partially overlapping the region (if any). For each encoded gene, a short description of the gene and associated Gene Ontology terms for the Biological Process classification (46) are provided, along with links to external databases: Ensembl (45), NCBI (47), Uniprot (48), UCSC (32), Expression Atlas (49), OMIM (50), Open Targets (51) and HumanMine (52). The third section contains cross-referenced publications that support the selection evidence found in the region. The fourth section contains an interactive graph showing recombination rate values in cM/Mb along the chromosome in which the region is located, calculated from the recombination map by Bh´erer et al. (53) and extracted from PopHuman (18). The specific location of the candidate region under selection is indicated with dashed vertical lines, and the solid horizontal line represents the average recombination rate value in the candidate region. At last, in the fifth section boxplots show the distribution of each significant statistic in all the populations (or population pairs). Highlighted values correspond to those in the candidate region, and those in red are outliers of the empirical distribution $P<0.0005$ .

# Utilities and support resources  

Contributing to PopHumanScan. PopHumanScan has been devised as a collaborative database. In order to incorporate information contributed by the scientific community, two password-protected tools have been implemented. The first one allows users to add additional candidate regions under selection in the catalog. All contributed regions will be subjected to manual curation and clearly labeled with a data source tag. The second tool allows manually cross-referencing candidate regions already present in the database.  

Help and tutorial. This section documents the data used and the procedures implemented in PopHumanScan, as well as instructions on how to contribute to it. Interestingly, it also contains a complete tutorial introducing to the usage of the database through a step-by-step worked example.  

# CONTENTS OF POPHUMANSCAN  

At the time of writing, the PopHumanScan database contains 2859 candidate regions under selection derived from the genome-wide selection scan pipeline presented here. Regions are distributed homogeneously along the autosomes and the X chromosome (Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S3). Of these, 1453 regions $(50.8\%)$ overlap GENCODE protein-coding genes, and 1986 regions $(69.5\%)$ are crossreferenced with at least one publication (Table 1 and Figure 3).  

# Selection signatures in meta-populations

overlap protein-coding genes; and 884 $(30.9\%)$ in EAS, of which 424 $(48.0\%)$ overlap protein-coding genes (Table 1). Most of the regions $(82.5\%)$ show signatures that are unique to one single meta-population (Figure 3A): 492 $(17.2\%)$ show signatures that are unique in EUR, 835 $(29.2\%)$ are unique in AFR, 433 $(15.1\%)$ are unique in SAS and 603 $(21.1\%)$ are unique in EAS. Of the 1090 regions showing signatures in AFR, $76.6\%$ are unique to AFR; while a lesser percentage––59.2, 54.7 and $68.2\%$ ––of the regions showing signatures in EUR, SAS and EAS, respectively, are unique to their meta-population. About one third $(29.0\%)$ of the candidate regions under selection are shared across populations within the same meta-population. This percentage is higher for candidate regions showing both LD and SFS signatures $(52.7\%)$ , it is $33.6\%$ for candidate regions showing LD signatures only and $27.1\%$ for candidate regions showing SFS signatures only.  

# Types of selection signature  

The total number of candidate regions showing distinct types of signatures of selection is: 487 $(17.0\%)$ for $L D$ ; 2451 $(85.7\%)$ for $S F S$ ; and 21 $(0.7\%)$ for Protein Changes (i.e. recurrent selection since the split between humans and chimpanzees) (Table 1). Most of the regions $(96.6\%)$ show one single signature of selection (Figure 3B): 403 $(14.1\%)$ show LD signatures only; and 2358 $(82.5\%)$ show SFS signatures only. All genes showing evidence of recurrent selection also show signatures in either LD and/or SFS, as only genes overlapping candidate regions under selection detected by LD and/or SFS were tested for $\alpha$ (MKT). These results would indicate that the statistics we used in our genomewide scan of selection look at different characteristics of the genetic variability of the region, and that they are largely complementary.  

# Structural description of the regions  

Region length. Most of the candidate regions under selection $(63.6\%)$ span one single $10\mathrm{-kb}$ window, and the variable lengths of candidate regions follows a reversed J-shaped distribution (Supplementary Figure S4A).  

Distance between consecutive regions. The average distance between consecutive candidate regions is ${\sim}1\mathrm{{Mb}}$ , and the distribution of distances is also reversed J-shaped (Supplementary Figure S4B).  

Recombination. The average recombination rate of the candidate regions is $0.71~\mathrm{cM/Mb}$ , and the distribution of recombination rates is again reversed J-shaped (Supplementary Figure S4C). There is a strong, negative, non-linear association between recombination rate and both region length (Supplementary Figure S5A) and distance between consecutive candidate regions (Supplementary Figure S5B).  

# Functional description of the regions  

Regulation. Most of the candidate regions $(90.5\%)$ contain at least one regulatory element annotated in the ORegAnno database, and $80.6\%$ contain TFBSs (Figure 3C). On the contrary, VISTA enhancers are much less abundant in the genome and they are only found in 23 of the 2859 candidate regions $(0.8\%)$ . $\mathrm{CpG}$ Islands are also in shortage and they are present in $9.3\%$ of the regions.  

Comparative genomics. Nearly all $(96.8\%)$ candidate regions overlap phastCons conserved elements. In the case of GERP and PhyloP, 88.2 and $74.7\%$ of the regions, respectively, overlap constrained bases with score ${>}2$ .  

Structural variation. The Database of Genomic Variants (DGV) (40) is a very exhaustive database of structural variants annotated in the human genome. One or more elements annotated in this database are present in $92.1\%$ of the candidate regions under selection. On the contrary, only 104 regions $(3.6\%)$ overlap validated polymorphic inversions from the manually curated InvFEST database (34).  

Archaic introgression. A total of 1526 of the candidate regions $(53.4\%)$ overlap haplotypes introgressed from either neanderthals or denisovans. This percentage is expected, as introgressed haplotypes persisting in different present-day human individuals cover $46.7\%$ of the reference genome (33).  

Cross-references with publications. A percentage of $69.5\%$ of the candidate regions are cross-referenced with at least one publication, and $36.0\%$ are cross-referenced more than once (Figure 3D).  

# Gene ontology analysis  

Our candidate regions overlap a total of 1447 unique GENCODE protein-coding genes. These were functionally classified into Gene Ontology (GO) terms (46) according to the PANTHER GO-Slim annotation dataset using the PANTHER Classification System (54) (Supplementary Figure S6). In addition, statistically over- and under-represented functions were analyzed using the complete GO annotation dataset (46) using the same tool (Supplementary Tables S3–5). Interestingly, among all Biological Process categories, regulation of neuron projection development is overrepresented (fold enrichment 1.88, False Discovery Rate (FDR) 1.23E-02), in addition to cellular component organization (fold enrichment 1.24, FDR 1.59E-03) (Supplementary Table S4). Finally, several Cellular Component categories are statistically over-represented, including presynaptic membrane (fold enrichment 2.72, FDR 4.32E-02) (Supplementary Table S5). In spite of finding some statistically over-represented GO categories in our genes list, selection signatures seem to be heterogeneous and a detailed analysis of each candidate region is required to understand the real story under each selective event.  

# POPHUMANSCAN WITH AN EXAMPLE: SELECTION AT THE LACTASE LOCUS  

The introduction of agriculture and cattle domestication in the Middle East and North Africa ${\sim}10000$ years ago lead to strong selection pressure for the ability to digest milk as adults. This is accomplished if the enzyme lactase that metabolizes lactose, encoded by the $L C T$ gene, maintains high levels into adulthood, a characteristic that is called lactase persistence. Several variants near the $L C T$ locus show some of the strongest signals of selection in the human genome for those populations that have traditionally practiced dairying, including a genetic variant in an intron of the gene MCM6, upstream of $L C T(3)$ .  

The $L C T$ locus is found inside the longest candidate region under selection reported in PopHumanScan $({\sim}1\mathrm{Mb})$ . The region is located in the long arm of chromosome 2 and contains 8 GENCODE protein-coding genes, including $L C T$ and MCM6 (Figure 4). Our genome-wide scan of selection has detected signatures at four different statistics that span the three types of signatures: LD (iHS and $X P.$ - EHH), SFS (Fu and Li’s $D$ ) and Protein Changes $(\alpha)$ . LD signatures involve basically EUR and AFR populations, while the signature of recurrent selection is more general to the four meta-populations. The region contains thousands of TFBSs and hundreds of ORegAnno regulatory elements, it overlaps evolutionary constrained elements, and $595\%$ of the region overlaps haplotypes introgressed from Neanderthals. It has been reported in 24 published articles (of the set of 268 that we considered).  

# CONCLUSION  

In summary, our exhaustive approach combining eight different statistics to detect candidate regions under selection in 22 non-admixed human populations has been able to locate distinct signatures in 2859 regions that stand out from the background genomic variability, including abnormally long haplotypes, shifts in the SFS or excess of nonsynonymous substitutions between our species and chimpanzees. Many of these regions probably manifest the footprints of selective sweeps that occurred at different historical ages, or recurrent selection that has been taking place during the last millions of years. The PopHumanScan online database is going to facilitate the thorough analysis of candidate regions under selection in the human genome by putting together all these evidences of selection with structural and functional annotations of the regions and crossreferences to previously published articles. Furthermore, the database can incorporate new data from the scientific community through specific build-in utilities. All in all, PopHumanScan aims to become a central repository to share information, guide future studies and contribute to the research on human genome adaptation.

# ABSTRACT  

The human genome harbors an abundance of repetitive DNA; however, its function continues to be debated. Microsatellites––a class of short tandem repeat––are established as an important source of genetic variation. Array length variants are common among microsatellites and affect gene expression; but, efforts to understand the role and diversity of microsatellite variation has been hampered by several challenges. Without adequate depth, both long-read and short-read sequencing may not detect the variants present in a sample; additionally, large sample sizes are needed to reveal the degree of population-level polymorphism. To address these challenges we present the Comparative Analysis of Germline Microsatellites (CAGm): a database of germline microsatellites from 2529 individuals in the 1000 genomes project. A key novelty of CAGm is the ability to aggregate microsatellite variation by population, ethnicity (super population) and gender. The database provides advanced searching for microsatellites embedded in genes and functional elements. All data can be downloaded as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Two use-case scenarios are presented to demonstrate its utility: a mononucleotide (A) microsatellite at the BAT-26 locus and a dinucleotide (CA) microsatellite in the coding region of FGFRL1. CAGm is freely available at http://www. cagmdb.org/.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Microsatellites are regions of DNA characterized by short, 1–6 bp, motifs repeated in tandem to form an array. Over $600~000$ unique microsatellites exist in the human genome embedded in gene introns, gene exons and regulatory regions (1,2). A number of databases provide searchable interfaces to microsatellites within the human reference genome (3–9), but none provide data on actual polymorphism rates among and within human populations. This is important because microsatellite polymorphisms occur frequently due to strand slip replication and heterozygote instability, in fact, mutation rates for microsatellites can be $10~000$ times higher than single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which have estimated mutation rate of $1\ \times\ 10^{-8}$ (10). Observed array length variations are largely consistent with a stepwise model: a model based on the idea that each mutation adds or subtracts a single repeat unit to the microsatellite array (11). However, microsatellites remain understudied compared to SNPs (12). In addition, the study of microsatellites can face technical limitations. Microsatellites are challenging for most next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms and alignment algorithms (13,14); without adequate sequencing depth both long-reads (454-sequencing) and short-reads (Illumina) are prone to errors. Gapped alignment algorithms can detect most microsatellite insertions and deletions (indels) (15); but, alignment of large insertion variants remains challenging. Moreover, large sample sizes are needed to understand the degree of populationlevel polymorphism that exists in these regions.  

Even with adequate data, several additional sequencing and bioinformatics challenges remain: polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification can introduce ‘stutter’ errors; optimal alignments may not be unique; and the likelihood of various allele combinations can be difficult to quantify (16,17). Bioinformatics tools for microsatellite genotyping use several strategies to address these challenges (17). Many tools are now designed to anticipate PCR errors (17) and some use custom alignment techniques (17). Others have used informed error profiles that incorporate read properties such as unit, length and base quality (18). For example, Repeatseq uses a Bayesian approach guided by an informed error profile; it was developed using data from the 1000 genomes project (18). A variety of statistical approaches are used to assign genotype likelihoods (17).  

Microsatellites have the capacity to affect gene expression (1) by inducing Z-DNA and H-DNA folding (19); altering nucleosome positioning (20); and changing the spacing of DNA binding sites (1). These possibilities are made even more intriguing by the non-random distribution of microsatellites in the human genome (2). In particular, the number of microsatellites in gene exons and regulatory regions far exceeds what is expected due to chance alone (1). Typically, microsatellites found in exons have 3 or 6 bp repeat motifs (21). Consequently, mutations result in single amino acid gain or loss; but, do not result in frameshifts. For these reasons microsatellites have been called the ‘tuning knobs’ of gene expression (1,22,23).  

The 1000 Genomes Project was launched in 2008 with the aim of creating the world’s largest public catalog of human genetic variation (24). Now finished, the complete data collection includes exome and whole genome sequencing data from over 2500 individuals. These individuals in turn come from 26 worldwide populations belonging to 5 ethnicities (super populations). The data are of high quality; in particular, a combination of high-depth exome sequencing and low-depth whole genome sequencing was used to detect low frequency variants $(>1\%)$ (24). Indeed, over 88 million variants are now cataloged: 84.7 million SNPs, 3.6 million short indels and 60 000 structural variants. However, the ability to query microsatellite variation within this data is not part of the 1000 genomes project. A catalog of human microsatellite variation is needed for at least three reasons. First, microsatellites are known to affect gene expression. Trinucleotide repeats can have dramatic effects and are known to increase the risk of particular genetic diseases such as Huntington’s disease, spinocerebellar ataxia and myotonic dystrophy (25). Second, recent studies have demonstrated the diagnostic potential of microsatellites for a limited number of cancers: breast cancer (26,27), ovarian cancer (27) and lung cancer (28). Third, germline DNA is easily obtained and therefore a well-suited target for genomic based testing for somatic microsatellite polymorphisms. Additional motives for cataloging microsatellite variants stem from their role in evolutionary biology, forensics, population genetics and kinship analysis, just to name a few.  

We introduce the Comparative Analysis of Germline Microsatellites; its acronym––CAGm––coincides with the important class of polyglutamine microsatellites. The database is designed to assist with future studies of germline microsatellites and enhance our understanding of human genetic variation. Analysis is included for germline microsatellites in whole exome sequencing of 2529 individuals in the  

1000 genomes project. The database is implemented using MySQL: a popular open source relational database. Samples can be easily grouped by population, ethnicity and gender. Microsatellites can be searched by gene, functional element and location. Users can query genotypes, view multiple sequence alignments and easily download data for further analysis. The database has a wide range of additional capabilities. Database content is fully described with examples and future directions are discussed. The database is freely available at http://www.cagmdb.org/.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Microsatellite list generation  

A list of microsatellites in version 38 of the human reference genome was generated with a custom Perl script ‘searchTandemRepeats.pl’ using default parameters. This script has been used in previous microsatellite studies (29) and is freely available online: http://genotan.sourceforge. net/# Toc324410847. The initial list generated with this script included 1 671 121 microsatellites. Only microsatellites of $100\mathrm{bp}$ or less were included for subsequent analysis. This limitation stems from the need to have both $3^{\prime}$ and $5^{\prime}$ flanking regions present to determine a microsatellite genotype; and, the 100 bp read length of Illumina (Solexa) sequencing technology. Briefly, the ‘searchTandemRepeats.pl’ script first searches for pure repetitive stretches: no impurities allowed. Imperfect repeats and compound repeats are then handled using a ‘mergeGap’ parameter with a default value of 10 bp. Essentially, impurities that interrupt stretches of pure repeat sequence are tolerated unless they exceed 10 bp. Likewise, repeats closer than 10 bp are considered compound. The result is that repeats in the CAGm database are highly pure; and, components of compound repeats are highly pure. To mitigate the likelihood of improper read mapping between microsatellites, we removed all subsets of microsatellites possessing the same repeat motif between 5 bp $3^{\prime}$ and $5^{\prime}$ flanking regions. For example, the microsatellites $\mathrm{^{\circ}G C T G C(A)^{34}C T\bar{T}A G^{\circ}}$ and $\mathrm{^{\circ}G C T G C(A)^{15}C T T A G^{\circ}}$ were removed from our initial list of microsatellites. Our filtered list included $625178\mathrm{\mi}$ - crosatellites unique in the human genome.  

# Microsatellite genotyping  

We used the program Repeatseq to determine the genotype of microsatellites in next generation sequencing reads (18). Methods used by the program itself can be found elsewhere (18). Repeatseq has been used in previous studies of microsatellites and is freely available: https://github.com/ adaptivegenome/repeatseq. Repeatseq operates on three input files: a reference genome, a file containing reads aligned to the human reference genome (.bam file) and a list of known microsatellites (see ‘Materials and Methods’ section above). The unique advantage of Repeatseq over other microsatellite genotyping programs is that it realigns each read to the reference genome prior to array length detection. Result files in variant call format (.vcf) for all samples are available on request.  

Each microsatellite genotype includes a pair of alleles which are in turn indicated by their base pair length. For example, the genotype $^{\cdot}14|15^{\cdot}$ indicates a heterozygote genotype with 14 and $15~\mathrm{bp}$ alleles, respectively. The genotype $\cdot_{15|15},$ indicates a homozygote genotype with two copies of the 15 bp allele.

Five ethnicities (super populations) are shown: African (AFR), American (AMR), European (EUR), East Asian (EAS) and South Asian (SAS). Each ethnicity draws from four to seven populations (not shown).  

# Samples  

Samples were downloaded from phase 3 of the 1000 genome project: ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/. All samples listed in the phase 3 index 20130502.phase3.exome.alignment.index––were included for analysis. Metadata for each sample was retrieved from the sample info file provided by the 1000 genomes project: 20130606 sample info.txt. A summary of samples included in the CAGm database is shown in Table 1.  

# Implementation  

The CAGm database is implemented with MySQL: a popular open source relational database. A website designed to interact with the database is implemented with HTML, PHP, CSS and Javascript. Codes written with PHP are adapted from the book, PHP and mysql for dynamic web sites: visual quickpro guide (30).  

# RESULTS  

# Database content and usage  

The CAGm database contains information on 625 178 microsatellites across 2529 individuals in the 1000 genomes project. These individuals in turn come from 26 worldwide populations belonging to 5 ethnicities (super populations). The database contains 31 645 227 microsatellites genotypes: 12 513 genotypes on average for each sample. Genotypes are easily filtered against their statistical likelihood. Access to the 1 560 636 846 next generation sequencing reads––used for microsatellite genotyping––provides a source of validation and further analysis.  

Contents of the CAGm database can be searched and downloaded with a modern web browser. No user registration is required. The website is navigated with assistance of five main pages: about micros; search samples; search micros; tables; and search motifs. Each page displays information in column-wise tables that are easily downloaded in Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Once downloaded users can perform additional analysis directly in excel or import as a data frame using python, R or perl. In what follows we describe the use and functionality provided by each main page. See Figure 1 for a sitemap. Then usage is demonstrated with respect to a mononucleotide (A) microsatellite at the BAT-26 locus and a dinucleotide (CA) microsatellite in the coding region of FGFRL1.  

# About micros (index.php)  

This page serves as the entry point for the CAGm database. Users are provided a brief description of microsatellites along with instructions for interacting with the database. Users are informed of updates in the version and change log at the bottom of the page.  

# Search samples (view samples.php)  

This page is used to browse the individual samples in the database. Users can search and sort by ethnicity, population and gender. Ethnicity and population codes are taken directly from the 1000 genomes project. The CAGm database currently contains 2529 samples: 667 Africian (AFR); 352 American (AMR); 514 East Asian (EAS); 502 European (EUR); and 494 South Asian (SAS).  

The leftmost columns provide links to the individual sample details and genotypes, respectively. Sample details are taken from the metadata provided by the 1000 genomes project: 20130606 sample info.txt. The link to genotypes sends users to a separate page listing genetic information for a single sample; once redirected, genetic information is displayed in a column-wise table with each entry corresponding to a single genotype (one row per microsatellite). All genotypes are supported by six or more next generation sequencing reads; however, the number of genotypes available is not the same for every sample. Essentially, the sequenced read depth varies for each sample which in turn affects the number of available genotypes. A link to alignments provides even finer grained resolution allowing users to view the individual NGS reads that overlap a particular microsatellite. Alignments can be used to verify the genetic information (genotypes) provided by the database or as a starting point for new analysis.  

# Search micros (view micros.php)  

Microsatellites listed in the CAGm database are browsed using the ‘search micros’ page. The search functionality allows users to find microsatellites based on position in the reference genome (GRCh38), gene, annotation and repeat unit. Searching by gene will find all microsatellites within the introns, exons, coding sequence and untranslated regions (utr). On the other hand, searching against an annotation will find matching microsatellites across all genes. For example, to find all microsatellites in coding sequence (cds) a user searches against annotations: the number of matching microsatellites is displayed at the top of the page. Intergenic microsatellites have no gene or annotation values (NULL). Details for each microsatellite are linked to the leftmost column of the data table. These details include––but are not limited to––location in older reference genomes, flanking sequence and nucleotide percentages. Download links to excel spreadsheets are provided. These details are intended to provide users with sufficient information to construct standard bioinformatics files: bed files and fasta files in particular. These can then be used with standard tools such as CruzDB for retrieving additional information about genomic regions (31); GeneCards for investigating potential links to human disease (32); and RefSeq/LocusLink for investigating homologous genes (33).

# Tables (search tables.php)  

A primary aim of the CAGm database is to contribute to what is known about human genetic variation. The ‘tables’ page is the entry point for browsing genetic variation by gender, population, and ethnicity (super population). Search functionality is identical to the aforementioned ‘search micros’ page. The difference is that only microsatellites with available genetic tables are listed in the search results. To display a genetic table users select a microsatellite using the radio buttons in the pick column. A second set of radio buttons is used to aggregate samples by gender, population or ethnicity (super population). A final set of radio buttons chooses how to display the genetic information: by genotype, allele or zygosity. Once submitted, users are redirected to a table summarizing genetic variation for the selected microsatellite (see Table 2 for an example). Users can easily re-group using two sets of radio buttons at the bottom of the page.  

Each table of genetic information is accompanied by two links: one downloads the data as a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet; another (show table details) provides genotypes for all samples used to generate the table. The list of genotypes for each sample is easily searched, sorted and downloaded for additional analysis.  

In general, microsatellite genotypes are difficult to infer with certainty from next generation sequencing reads. Genotypes in the CAGm database were determined using Bayesian model selection guided by an empirically derived error model (18); and, each is assigned a likelihood that the call made is correct. For serious projects it is recommended that the CAGm genotypes be vetted by examining the multiple sequence alignments available for download on the ‘show table details’ page. However, some vetting is built in to the database with a ‘minimum likelihood’ filter. Genotypes with assigned likelihood below the user adjusted value are excluded from genotype tables. We recommend exploring the database with the minimum likelihood set to 50, before moving to higher values.  

# Search Motifs (view motifs.php)  

This page shows motifs shared among coding microsatellites within the CAGm database; here, motif broadly refers to an amino acid sequence, unit or gene. Microsatellites sharing a motif are aggregated and sorted by their count. Users can limit aggregation to specific regions of the genome or search for specific motifs using a form at the top of the page. The left-most column provides a link that redirects users to a sub-list of the aggregated microsatellites for the selected motif. Users can search the sub-list of microsatellites by genomic region or motif using a form at the top of the page. The sub-list also provides links to details for each microsatellites and radio buttons for displaying genetic tables (if available).  

Table 2. A key novelty of CAGm are tables that aggregate microsatellite variation by population, ethnicity (super population) and gender   


<html><body><table><tr><td>genotype</td><td>AFR</td><td>AMR</td><td>EUR</td><td>EAS</td><td>SAS</td></tr><tr><td>17121</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>19121</td><td>33</td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>11</td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td>21121</td><td>403</td><td>164</td><td>238</td><td>198</td><td>297</td></tr><tr><td>21123</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>21125</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr></table></body></html>

Variants can be aggregated by genotype (shown), allele and zygosity. The table above shows genotypes by ethnicity (super population) for a CA dinucleotide repeat embedded in exon 6 of the FGFRL1 gene (chr4:1025267-1025287). Five ethnicities are shown: African (AFR), American (AMR), European (EUR), East Asian (EAS) and South Asian (SAS).  

# CAGm recapitulates polymorphic variation at the BAT-26 locus  

The BAT-26 locus contains a 12-27-repeat polyadenine tract, located on chromosome 2 within the fifth intron of the MSH2 gene. CAGm shows a total of $15B A T–26$ alleles segregating in human populations, with the highest degree of polymorphism in Africa (14 alleles) and the lowest in East Asia (5 alleles). Allelic variation in the size of the poly-A tract at $B A T–26$ has previously been found in 13 out of 103 healthy African-Americans $(12.6\%)$ (34).  

Variation in $B A T\ –26$ is commonly associated with microsatellite instability (MSI) in colorectal adenomas and carcinomas (35–41). Racial/ethnic disparities in the incidence of colorectal cancer have been observed in USA, with African Americans having increased risk (42–45), but its direct association with $B A T–26$ polymorphism and MSI has not been studied. Additionally, BAT-26 variation has been implicated in MSI associated with bladder (46) and gastric carcinomas (47). Data provided by CAGm could be used for hypothesis generating and new analysis.  

# CAGm builds on what is known about FGFRL1  

The fibroblast growth factor receptor-like 1 (FGFRL1) gene encompasses the longest exonic dinucleotide microsatellite repeat in the human genome. The human reference genome indicates the dinucleotide unit (CA) is repeated 10 times in the coding region of FGFRL1 (48). Our findings, displayed in CAGm, indicate that microsatellite alleles vary from $8-$ 12 units (see Table 2). Although non-coding dinucleotide microsatellites are highly mutable (10), the length of exonic dinucleotide microsatellites are tightly conserved, because of the possible damaging effects of protein-altering mutations (49). A previous study demonstrated that the CAmicrosatellite in FGFRL1 (chr4:1025267-1025287) has a repeat length of 10 in 400 sampled human chromosomes (48). The CAGm database has built on this result by genotyping the same microsatellite in 1413 samples from the 1000 genome project: 1300 of these samples have a repeat length of $10~\mathrm{CA}$ units (21 bp). However, CAGm reveals that 97 samples may carry a 9 CA unit allele $(19\mathrm{bp})$ and 11 samples may carry an $11\mathrm{CA}$ unit allele $(23\mathrm{bp})$ . In fact, CAGm also shows 4 samples with an 8 unit allele and 1 with a 12 unit allele. Still, further investigation is needed. Under stringent filter conditions the more extreme calls of 17 and 25 bp are unsupported while the 19 and 23 bp alleles are supported. These data support the hypothesis that the CA-repeat in FGFRL1 is in mutation-selection balance; in other words, strong purifying selection does not fully purge populations of all deleterious alleles.  

Variations in FGFRL1 have been associated with clinical phenotypes such as Wolf–Hirschhorn syndrome, a rare genetic disease involving symptoms of delayed development, intellectual disability, ataxia and seizures (50). The Catalogue of Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) database indicates that FGFRL1 is altered and overexpressed in multiple cancers subtypes e.g. in ovarian tissue, FGFRL1 was overexpressed in $13.2\%$ of the 266 tested samples (51). Interestingly, the COSMIC database identifies insertion/deletion frameshift mutations in exonic dinucleotide microsatellite loci of FGFRL1 in 13 samples. FGFRL1 has not been thoroughly studied despite the fact that variations in this locus may be clinically relevant.  

# DISCUSSION  

It is now acknowledged that microsatellites play an important role in gene expression. Consequently, a growing number of studies are leveraging microsatellites as genetic markers of complex human disease. Although MSI has been studied for decades, less attention has been given to germline microsatellites. This discrepancy is slowly changing. So far, germline microsatellite markers have been proposed for breast cancer (26,27), ovarian cancer (27) and lung cancer (28). The Comparative Analysis of Germline Microsatellites (CAGm) database presented in this work may expedite the discovery of additional markers by serving as a catalog of germline genotypes in healthy individuals. Thus, studies aimed at microsatellite marker discovery should be able to use CAGm for construction of suitable control groups by drawing samples from particular ethnicities, populations or regions.  

The use of our database is not limited to biomarker discovery. Future studies could also use these data to shed light on human genetic variation at large. Exonic (coding) microsatellites directly affect translation and primary protein structure. The effects of microsatellites in other functional units may be less direct but nonetheless important. It is hypothesized that microsatellite variants in ${5}^{\prime}$ -UTRs affect transcription and translation; those in $3^{\prime}$ -UTRs may cause transcription slippage or disrupted splicing (52). The database presented in this work will contribute by revealing new microsatellite variants and the extent of genetic variation in 26 worldwide populations belonging to 5 ethnicities. We show that the contents of CAGm are consistent with previous studies of a mononucleotide (A) microsatellite at the BAT-26 locus and a dinucleotide (CA) microsatellite in the coding region of FGFRL1. In the case of BAT-26, CAGm reveals a high degree of polymorphism in Africa (14 alleles). In the case of FGFRL1, CAGm reveals several previously unknown array length variants that may affect its function. Many additional unknown variants undoubtedly remain in the database.  

So far we have only analyzed microsatellites with array length variants ${<}100$ bp: a limitation that stems from the read length of Illumina (Solexa) sequencing technology. Essentially, detection of a microsatellite variant requires reads spanning the entire tandem repeat array and its unique $3^{\prime}$ and $5^{\prime}$ flanking base pairs (18). Reads that truncate the tandem repeat array are unused in our analysis. Unfortunately, we suspect that some of these unused truncated reads are genetically and clinically relevant. Indeed, the disease range for most trinucleotide expansion disorders exceeds 100 bp. Superficially it seems that the CAGm database can easily be improved by using longer read sequencing technologies: Roche 454, IonTorrent, PacBio and NanoPore. However, these technologies are prone to indel errors at a rate much higher than illumina; in the case of microsatellites this is critical limitation. Nevertheless, rapid improvements in sequencing technology may soon pave the way for expansion of the CAGm database to include insertions in excess of 100 bp.

# ABSTRACT  

The Planteome project (http://www.planteome.org) provides a suite of reference and species-specific ontologies for plants and annotations to genes and phenotypes. Ontologies serve as common standards for semantic integration of a large and growing corpus of plant genomics, phenomics and genetics data. The reference ontologies include the Plant Ontology, Plant Trait Ontology and the Plant Experimental Conditions Ontology developed by the Planteome project, along with the Gene Ontology, Chemical Entities of Biological Interest, Phenotype and Attribute Ontology, and others. The project also provides access to species-specific Crop Ontologies developed by various plant breeding and research communities from around the world. We provide integrated data on plant traits, phenotypes, and gene function and expression from 95 plant taxa, annotated with reference ontology terms. The Planteome project is developing a plant gene annotation platform; Planteome Noctua, to facilitate community engagement. All the Planteome ontologies are publicly available and are maintained at the Planteome GitHub site (https://github.com/Planteome) for sharing, tracking revisions and new requests. The annotated data are freely accessible from the ontology browser (http:  

# //browser.planteome.org/amigo) and our data repository.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Recent estimates show that the global population is projected to reach 9.6 billion people in the next few decades (http://www.wri.org/blog/2013/12/global-food-challengeexplained-18-graphics), and this presents enormous challenges for worldwide food production. Both basic and applied plant biology research frameworks are generating enormous quantities of next-generation plant science data from the high-throughput characterization of genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes and phenotypes along with large-scale genetic screens such as genome-wide association studies. Although this large volume of data is available, plant biologists, geneticists and breeders face the challenge of how to leverage this information efficiently and effectively. Finding novel gene targets and markers may help improve current plant germplasm and create new varieties, thus, ultimately contributing to the yield and quality of crops and feedstock for the growing global population, while also protecting the earth’s environment.  

Traditionally, many crop breeding communities have maintained their own standards for data formats and descriptors, for example, in the form of species-specific trait dictionaries. These data have important uses when it comes to formulating and testing hypotheses and for comparative analysis. However, researchers often face challenges in sharing this data due to incompatibilities in data formats and descriptions of observations and experimental setups provided by different communities. Community-wide data sharing and re-use requires the use of common data standards and ontologies that provide a semantic framework for data collection, annotation and comparative analysis.

\*The Planteome NCBI Taxonomy is a ‘slice’ or portion of the NCBI taxonomy file, with only those terms needed to create annotation to plants in the Planteome database. It is converted to an OWL file for loading into the Planteome Database. Planteome reference ontologies cover a range of knowledge domains and are used to annotate plant genomics and phenomics data.  

The Planteome project provides a centralized web portal (www.planteome.org) which features a suite of interconnected reference ontologies (listed in Table 1) utilized by the plant biology community for the annotation of plant gene expression data, traits, phenotypes, genomes and germplasm, across 95 plant taxa. The portal also hosts eight species-specific Crop Ontologies (CO) describing traits and phenotype scoring standards being adopted by international breeding projects on maize (Zea mays), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), soybean (Glycine max), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), rice (Oryza sativa), cassava (Manihot esculenta), lentil (Lens culinaris) and wheat (Triticum aestivum). The CO adoption is an integral part of the Integrated Breeding Platform and tools developed by the Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research (http://www. cgiar.org/). All ontologies and annotated data are available from the project website and browser, and through our web services and Application Programming Interface (API) for integration with software tools designed for data collection and curation, genome annotation and analysis. In this publication, we introduce the Planteome resource and provide details on how it can be accessed and utilized. We also introduce the Planteome Noctua gene annotation tool for engaging the research community in the functional annotation of plant genes.  

# THE PLANTEOME DATABASE  

The Planteome database is accessible from our web site (http://planteome.org/) designed in Drupal version 6. It features an ontology browser and faceted search options to access ontologies and ontology-based annotations of various bioentities. The ontology browser (http://browser. planteome.org/amigo) is a customized adoption of the AmiGO browser (1), developed by the Gene Ontology Consortium. All data and ontologies are stored in a SOLR (http: //lucene.apache.org/solr) index system that allows for fulltext searches through the ontology browser. The schema and index files for the design of the data store are available at the GitHub repository https://github.com/Planteome/ amigo. In the current Planteome 2.0 Release, the Planteome database provides access to reference (Table 1) and speciesspecific ontologies and approximately 2 million (M) bioentities, or data objects, including proteins, genes, RNA transcripts, gene models, germplasm and QTLs (Quantitative Trait Loci; Table 2). Often more than one ontology term from the same or multiple reference ontology classes are used for bioentity annotation; the $2\textbf{M}$ entities have approximately $21\mathrm{~M~}$ annotations to date. A mirror site of the Planteome database (not the website) is also accessible from the CyVerse cyberinfrastructure (http://cyverse.planteome. org).  

# Reference ontologies and vocabularies for plant biology  

Ontologies provided by the Planteome can be used to annotate descriptions (for example, in experimental logs or trials), of the events, processes, conditions and observations for a broad range of entities. Such annotations range from the molecular function of a gene, its localization, and cell-, tissue- or organ-specific expression, to the broader role in response to growth environments and treatments at the whole plant or population level. In the current Planteome Release (2.0), the Planteome database includes a collection of 51 874 ontology terms (excluding obsoletes) from a suite of reference ontologies for plants (Table 1). They include the Plant Ontology (PO) (2–7), Plant Trait Ontology (TO) (8,9) and Plant Experimental Conditions Ontology (PECO) (8), which are developed in-house by the Planteome project. An additional set of reference ontologies include those developed by the collaborating groups, but relevant for use in annotation of plant biology data. These are the Gene Ontology (GO) (10), the Phenotypic Qualities Ontology (PATO) (11), Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) (12), the Evidence and Conclusion Ontology (ECO) (13) and the NCBI taxonomy (14), described in Table 1.

Each bioentity (gene, QTL, germplasm, etc.) may have more than one ontology annotation from the reference ontologies.  

All component reference ontologies are members of the OBO library (http://www.obofoundry.org/), and follow the guiding principles (15) suggested by the OBO Foundry, (http://www.obofoundry.org/principles/fp-000-summary. html) that foster a cooperative, interoperable community of vocabularies in ways which maximize opportunities for sharing and reuse. They include requirements that the ontologies be open, have a clear, defined scope, share a common format, use term-to-term relations which are unambiguously defined and are developed through a collaborative process for use by multiple resources.  

Each ontology class has a unique primary term name and an alphanumeric identifier (ID) that forms part of a universal resource identifier, for example, the TO class: leaf color (TO:0000326) (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ TO 0000326; note that throughout the manuscript, ontology term names are written in italics). Terms in the ontologies should also have human-readable text definitions, including a citation to the source of the definition and to the names of the curators responsible for the annotation (16). Terms may also have synonyms, such as alternate names used in different plant research communities, or other languages. The synonym types include exact, related, narrow and broad (16). For example, the classes in the plant anatomical entity branch of the PO provide synonyms in Japanese and Spanish (6,7). Definitions often come with comments which provide additional information or examples of usage. Here, we provide brief summaries of the ontologies created and maintained by the Planteome Project.  

Plant Ontology. The PO was developed in response to the need for a standardized terminology to describe plant anatomy and developmental stages for use in the annotation of plant genomics data (2–7). The PO consists of two branches; (i) the plant anatomical entity branch that describes plant structures, including whole plant, plant anatomical spaces such as the axil, and plant substances such as cutin and (ii) the plant structure development stage (PSDS) branch, that describes the stages of plant growth and development, such as the flowering stage or the plant embryo development stage. Terms in the PSDS are mapped to other plant development scales which are species or clade specific, such as Boyes et al. (17) for Arabidopsis and the Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt und CHemische industrie scale, which covers many crops such as cereals and grapes (18). Future work on the PSDS may include integrating the Plant Phenology Ontology (19), which describes the timing of plant life-cycle events.  

Ontology terms from the PO can be used to describe the spatial and temporal attributes of the sample source in an experiment. For example, the anatomical part from which samples were extracted, or on the growth stage at which the gene, QTL or phenotype was observed in a plant or population. For example, the rice gene SD1 (Semidwarf1) is expressed in the primary shoot system during the stem elongation stage. The PO is designed to be species neutral, and thus, terms from the PO can be used to describe all green plants (the Viridiplantae). Terms in the PO are linked to annotated data from a wide variety of plants, ranging from traditional model species such as Arabidopsis thaliana to the crop plants such as maize, rice, and wheat that feed the world’s growing population. In the current Planteome Release 2.0, there are approximately $1.4\mathrm{~M~}$ annotations to anatomy terms in PO and $1.1\ \mathrm{M}$ to development stage terms.  

Plant Trait Ontology. A plant trait is a measurable characteristic of a plant or plant population, while a plant phenotype is an observed qualitative or quantitative value of a corresponding trait. For example, the TO term, leaf color (TO:0000326), is a commonly evaluated trait in plants. This term is combined with a quality term, such as yellow (PATO:0000324), to describe the phenotype leaf color yellow. Similarly, the trait plant height can be scored qualitatively as dwarf, tall, and semi-dwarf, as well as quantitatively by recording the absolute values, for example; 110, $96~\mathrm{cm}\$ , etc. to determine the phenotype. The TO facilitates interoperability between systems sharing trait data by providing pre-composed descriptions of a wide range of plant traits. The TO was originally created to describe rice QTL traits (20) and was expanded concurrently with the PO to encompass all green plants (Viridiplantae). Many of the TO classes follow the Entity–Quality (E–Q) pattern (11) where entity classes are drawn from the PO, GO and ChEBI and quality classes from PATO. The TO encompasses nine broad, upper-level categories of plant traits: biochemical trait, biological process trait, plant growth and development trait, plant morphology trait, quality trait, stature or vigor trait, sterility or fertility trait, stress trait and yield trait. Traits can be observed at any scale, ranging from molecular entities in plant cells, to cell types, tissues, organs, whole organisms and populations.  

Plant experimental conditions ontology. PECO describes the biotic and abiotic treatments, growing conditions, and study types used in various types of plant biology experiments (8). For example, the conditions used to assess the response against a given type of treatment such as water deficit, red light, watering, photoperiod, soil type, fertilizer, nutrients, applications of growth hormones, and exposure to pest and pathogens.  

# Non-reference community vocabularies for plant biology  

Crop ontology. In addition to the reference ontologies, the Planteome, includes a collection of species- or clade-specific application ontologies developed by the Crop Ontology (CO; http://www.cropontology.org/) project (21). The CO provides ontology-based descriptors for crop traits and standard variables for more than 20 crops to support field book design and phenotypic data annotations. To foster consistency in the data capture and annotation, each variable consists of a combination of a method and a scale suggested to be used for a given trait. Planteome curators work with CO developers and plant breeders to integrate terms used by their community by creating mappings to the reference ontologies, thus helping to connect phenotypes and germplasm annotations to genomics resources. Planteome Release 2.0 includes eight species-specific trait ontologies developed by the CO, for the crop plants, cassava (Manihot esculenta), maize (Zea mays), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), rice (Oryza sativa), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), soybean (Glycine max), wheat (Triticum aestivum) and lentil (Lens culinaris).  

# Planteome annotations  

A key feature of the Planteome database is its use of the GO-derived strategy of annotations, described in detail by Hill et al. (22). An annotation is a link between an ontology term and a bioentity (also known as a data object). Annotations are created either manually by expert curators, or computationally and stored in Gene Association Format (GAF 2.0) files (http://www.geneontology.org/page/ go-annotation-file-formats). The latter are essentially tabdelimited plain text files with the information organized into 17 columns. Each line in a GAF file corresponds to the assertion that some association exists between a bioentity and an ontology term. Each annotation includes a reference (usually to a PubMed ID) to support the assertion, and a conventional evidence code (http://planteome. org/evidence codes). Statistics on the evidence types used to support the ontology annotations can be found in Table 3. This integration allows users to filter the annotation search results by the evidence type to an extent, by selecting the appropriate type from the facets available from the annotations results pages (e.g. http://browser.planteome. org/amigo/search/annotation). We are working on mapping these evidence codes to the reference Evidence and Conclusion Ontology (ECO), which will allow the users to find all or a subset of annotations supported by a given experimental evidence described by the ECO (Supplementary File SF1).  

The files are stored in the Planteome Subversion Repository (http://planteome.org/svn/) and are loaded into the  

Planteome ontology browser, along with the network of ontologies. The curated data have been developed or sourced by Planteome curators and researchers at 20 other collaborating source databases (Table 4). The hyperlinked cross references in the browser connect the user to the original source for further information.  

Terms from both branches of the PO and the other reference ontologies (Table 1) have been used to annotate mutant phenotypes in six plant species to facilitate cross-species querying for phenologs (orthologous phenotypes) and semantic similarity analyses (23). Classically, phenologs are defined as phenotypes related by the orthology of the associated genes in two species (24). In the Planteome, annotations may include any characteristic from molecular, functional, to gross level anatomical and growth stage observations. Therefore, Planteome annotations and the ontologies may help in answering questions such as ‘Do the gene family members preserve similar phenotypes?’ or ‘Are the phenologs also true gene homologs?’  

The annotation database is accessible online directly from the Annotation search page (see below) on the Planteome portal (http://browser.planteome.org/amigo/ search/annotation), and the GAF files are also available for bulk download from the Planteome Subversion Repository (http://planteome.org/svn/).  

# Planteome ontology and data annotation browser  

Researchers interested in exploring the Planteome database can access the ontologies and annotated data in various ways. The Planteome home page (http://planteome.org/) features a search box where you can search directly for ontology terms or bioentities. The menu has links to documentation, issue trackers, information on the project and its ontologies, publications and a contact form. To access the ontology browser (http://browser.planteome.org/amigo), users can click on the ‘Ontology Browser’ link on the Planteome home page and then click on the “Browse’ button on the menu bar at the top. On the browser page (http://browser. planteome.org/amigo/dd browse), users can explore the ontology hierarchy and associated annotation data using the ‘drill down’ browser (Figure 1A). From the top levels, one can open direct descendant terms individually by clicking on the $^+$ sign on the left hand side to create a custom view. Gray circles next to the ontology terms show the number of bioentities annotated to that ontology term. The filters on taxon and ontology/bioentity type on the left hand side (Figure 1B) allows further filtering of query results. By clicking on the gray circle, a popup window opens (Figure 1C) with term information including the identifier number, term name, definition, ontology source, synonyms, alternate IDs (if any) and synonyms. A hyperlink from the term name in the popup box will take the user to the ontology term detail page (Figure 1D). By selecting the ‘Bioentities’ link in the popup box, a new window opens with a list of all the bioentities associated with that term (Figure 1E).  

Two search features are also available from the browser page. The ‘Quick Search’ box (Figure 1F) allows free text entries to be input and returns a list of related ontology terms and/or bioentities, and faceted searches can be performed using the ‘Search’ button (see below; Figure 1G).

Figure 1. An overview of the Planteome ontology and data annotation browser. (A) The drill-down browser allows users to explore the ontology hierarchy and the associated annotation data. Gray circles next to the ontology term names show the number of bioentities annotated to that ontology term either directly or accumulated indirectly from its children terms guided by the ontology tree and the term–term relationship types (B) Bioentities can be filtered by type and source taxon by selecting the red (exclude from search) or green (restrict search to) boxes on the left hand side. (C) Term information window appears if one clicks on an ontology term and displays the alphanumeric identifier, term name, definition, ontology source, synonyms and alternate IDs (if any). (D) The term detail page can be accessed by clicking on the term name in the popup window, with additional information and links to direct and indirect annotations. (E) A full list of all the bioentities associated with the selected term can be opened by selecting the ‘Retrieve Bioentities’ link in the popup box. (F) Free text search box. (G) Faceted search menu.

The rows highlighted in light gray color are manual annotations and those in dark gray are results of automated/computational analysis. The project has integrated the use of ECO terms in its database by adopting the ECO-GO evidence code mappings (http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/ Evidence Code Ontology (ECO)) computationally, transforming the data to build associations to the ECO terms.

Faceted searches. The ‘Search’ button (Figure 1G) on the menu bar opens the faceted search interface to query ontology terms, specific bioentities or annotated data. Searching for an ontology term results in a page listing the possible related terms (Figure 2A). Results can be filtered using the ‘Ontology source’ filter. If selected, it restricts the search results to the selected ontology. Other search options include filtering by subsets (terms that apply to a given taxa), ontology ancestors (moving up the tree) and whether or not the terms have been obsoleted. Users can go to an ontology term detail page by clicking on the hyperlinked term name in the results list.  

The second faceted search option is a search for bioentities (data objects) in the Planteome database (Figure 2B). Options include filtering by source database, object type, taxon and direct and indirect (parent terms) annotated ontology terms. The third search option on the drop-down menu allows one to search for annotations between the bioentities and ontology terms (Figure 2C). On this page, the bioentities are listed, along with the associated ontology terms. Direct annotations are those made on the ontology term itself, while indirect annotations are those gathered on terms higher in the hierarchy of the ontology. The annotation search interface allows additional facets to filter the queries including evidence types, taxon, ontology (aspect), etc. (Figure 2C and Supplementary File SF1). On any of these three search pages, use the ‘Free-text filter’ box for further filtering. For example, performing a search for ontology terms, as in Figure 2A, enter the term ‘leaf’ and the results get filtered for only the terms that have the word ‘leaf’ in the name. Clicking the ‘Bookmark’ button on the window will generate a URL for safe keeping.

# Data downloads  

A custom download of up to 100 000 lines is allowed from any of the three faceted search pages shown in Figure 2. The interface allows selection of data fields for downloading in a tab-delimited, plain text file format. For advanced users, bulk annotations data files are freely available for download from the project SVN (http://planteome.org/svn) in the GAF format. The ontology files are accessible in OBO or OWL format from http://github.com/Planteome. The web services or API methods of data downloads and access are described later for advanced users.  

# Planteome community  

Since the inception of the GO in 1998 (25), the global genomics community has come to recognize the importance of unified vocabularies to data interoperability. The plant genomics community has adopted the Planteome reference ontologies for use in a range of databases and genomics platforms (Table 5), from model organism sites such as TAIR and MaizeGDB to sites dealing with specific datasets such as protein domains (Superfamily), enzymes (BRENDA) or nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of metabolic profiles (MeRy-B). Several of the adopting projects (for example; Arapheno, BIP, Phenopsis DB, RARGEII and SGN) are using the Planteome ontologies to annotate and organize plant phenotyping data and a number of them, such as TAIR, MaizeGDB and SGN are contributing their annotated data to the Planteome Database.  

# Tools for collaboration and annotation  

Web services. The Planteome project provides an API (http://planteome.org/web services) that allows collaborators to access and use our data for intergation their web sites and applications. The API calls can be configured to query any of the ontology terms, their definitions, and other attributes, and annotation data, returning them in JSON format. The ‘Search’ method is fast enough to be used in an autocomplete search box, returning the basic information, while the ‘Detailed Term Search’ returns the complete data about a specific term. The Planteome project also delivers a standardized web service built on the BioLink API (http://biolink.planteome.org/api/). BioLink represents biomedical and biological entities and the relationships between them. This includes genes, diseases, phenotypes, and metadata such as ontology terms, and is also used by projects such as the Monarch Initiative (https://monarchinitiative.org/) to drive portions of their website. The implemented BioLink API server (https://github.com/biolink/biolink-api) provides a swagger I/O end-point (https://swagger.io/) that can be used to automatically generate code to extract data in a uniform manner from a script or as part of an alternate web site. Using the exposed API we were able to provide a tool for the Galaxy Workflow Tool to expose Planteome data (https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/view/ nathandunn/biolinkplanteome/66ece4fd024f), for example: http://biolink.planteome.org/api/bioentity/MaizeGD $\mathbf{B\bar{\%}}$ 3A9024907/associations/?rows $=20$ .  

Ontology development and requests. All Planteome ontologies are maintained on the GitHub site (https://github. com/Planteome). The files for each Planteome reference and community ontology such as the COs are maintained in separate repositories. The ontology releases are managed through the GitHub release process. It allows collaborative development of ontologies by multiple registered and trained curators in various parts of the world. We use the issue tracker for each respective ontology repository for requesting new terms, edits or offering comments. For example, one can submit requests for PO terms at https://github. com/Planteome/plant-ontology/issues.  

Gene annotation tool. Planteome Noctua (http://noctua. planteome.org/; Figure 3) is a web-based tool for collaborative curation and annotation of plant genes supported by empirical data and published literature sources. It is a customized version of the one used by the GO consortium (http://noctua.berkeleybop.org/). Registered users login with their GitHub credentials and can either create new annotations or edit existing ones. Planteome Noctua utilizes the reference ontologies described here including the GO; thus providing the ability to create a knowledge graph or model to annotate genes, or gene products and associate them with anatomical parts of a plant, developmental stages and/or traits, phenotypes, experimental conditions and treatments.  

The core element of a statement in the model is called an ‘individual’ which can be an ontology term or a bioentity in the database. Individuals are linked together into units called ‘annatons’ by selecting the appropriate relationship and evidence type. For example, a curator may start by finding a bioentity (e.g. a gene) by filling in the gene name in the autocomplete box under ‘Add Individual.’ This can be repeated to create a list of ontology terms or bioentities. The appropriate relationships between the individuals are then created by connecting the blue dots and selecting the appropriate relationship type from the list. To add evidence to an individual, click on the empty circle in the box that illustrates a relation and an entity. In the resulting popup window, go to the ‘Evidence’ section and add an Evidence Type from the ECO, a supporting reference (either PMID, DOI or PO REF), and where appropriate, an entry in the With/From field. These fields can be filled in the appropriate autocomplete boxes. Existing annotations can be imported from the Planteome ontology browser using the ‘Function Companion’ or ‘GP Buddy’ options by clicking on the green circle to edit annotations. Annotations created in Planteome Noctua can be downloaded in two different annotation file formats: GPAD and OWL, and can be converted to the GAF format for loading into the Planteome database. Our goal is to build Planteome as a common portal for collection, editing and distribution of the publicly annotated data on genes. Since Planteome Noctua allows use of multiple reference ontologies including GO, after integrating these annotations in the Planteome database, the gene annotations will be shared with our collaborators and the GO project by using both the APIs and the bulk downloads.

# Data integration, curation and database development  

The CO vocabularies are developed as species-specific, tab-delimited lists developed on the CO Trait Dictionary Version 5 format: (http://www.cropontology.org/ CropOntology Curation Guidelines 20160510.pdf) and include traits, as well as the associated methods and scales of measurement. The CO trait terms (21) were mapped to equivalent or exact matching terms in the reference TO (26). Based on the mapping, the CO terms were added the TO graph as species-specific subclasses of their best matches (Figure 4). It allows the CO to use the same species-neutral ontology tree from the TO as a starting point for building a robust ontology optimized for data sharing and integration between crop research communities. Thus avoiding the resources and time needed to create and duplicate the development of new species-specific ontologies. Additional species-specific ontologies can be easily created using only a flat list of species-specific traits, and their mappings to the reference TO. This allows for rapid development of application ontologies due to an existing foundation from which to build.

Figure 3. A view of a model under development in Planteome Noctua. Planteome Noctua (http://noctua.planteome.org/) is a web-based tool for collaborative curation and gene annotation supported by published literature or empirical data. Individuals from the reference ontologies are linked to one another through relationships and these assertions are supported by an evidence code from the Evidence and Conclusion Ontology. Once the model is complete, the information is saved and can be exported as a formatted file which can be processed to add the information to the database.  

Standardized GO annotations for plant genomes and transcriptomes. Functional GO annotations were carried out in-house for 62 plant taxa. These annotations were done by integrating computational inferences from InterproScan (27) and projecting the manually curated annotations in Arabidopsis based on the orthology inferences driven by the InParanoid (28) clustering method described earlier (29,30). The orthology-based annotations were projected to the 62 species in a taxon-restrictive manner to avoid over projection and wrong annotations, e.g. flower development annotations from Arabidopsis were not projected to green algae. Duplicate annotations from the InterproScan and orthology-based annotations received higher confidence and were merged as unique. The Planteome is a unique annotation resource for finding annotations for many of the 62 species (http://planteome.org/node/128).  

Germplasm annotations. A semi-automated pipeline was developed to create ontology-based annotations of plant germplasm (31). Many plant breeding and germplasm repository databases such as the USDA Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN: https://www.ars-grin.gov/) and The International Rice Informatics Consortium (IRIC: http://iric.irri.org/home) evaluate germplasm for a limited set of traits on their sites and record them in their databases using trait descriptors in plain text, a species-specific CO vocabulary or a proprietary controlled list. To improve interoperability of these data, a link between the individual trait descriptors and the reference ontology must be established. The native data format varies by source. To ensure proper data transformation and quality control before integration in the Planteome database, one of the first steps in annotating germplasm is mapping the source trait descriptors to the ontology terms from the reference TO. For example, ‘pod color’ trait evaluated in soybean/legume was mapped to the reference TO term fruit color (TO:0002617). This is followed by the data transformation step where a conversion script is run (script and examples available: https://github.com/Planteome/common-files-for-refontologies/tree/master/scripts/germplasm annotation) on the source data file and the trait mapping data to format the data files in the standard GAF 2.0 ontology annotation file format. The GAF formatted files are uploaded to the Planteome database at the time of the database build, and the resulting annotations provide hyperlinked cross references to the source. The original data must include three things: (i) a unique identifier for each germplasm entry, (ii) name of the evaluated trait and (iii) a phenotype score (observed qualitative/quantitative variables for the evaluated trait). It is important for the germplasm identifier to be unique in order to create a link back to the source database and avoid redundancies.

Figure 4. A view of the ontology hierarchy around Trait Ontology term plant height (TO:0000207). Crop Ontology (CO) terms for plant height from th entil, wheat, rice and cassava ontologies are mapped to the Trait Ontology term for data integration.  

When available, we encourage providing additional useful pieces of information, such as, germplasm name synonyms, geographic location anme and GIS coordinates identifying the place where the original seed or plant was collected, and where the phenotype was observed. In the current state, GAF formatted phenotype data is a must for integrating them in the Planteome database. The same GAF formatted files are also available to users for integration in their analyses and tools.  

# CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS  

The Planteome is a unique resource for both basic plant biology researchers such as evolutionary or molecular biologists and geneticists, and also for plant breeders who are interested in selecting for various traits of interest. The novel aspect of the Planteome lies in the semantic strength of the integrated ontology network, which can be traversed computationally. Planteome allows plant scientists in various fields to identify traits of interest, and locate data, including germplasm, QTL and genes associated with a given trait, and can help in building hypotheses, confirming observations, data sharing and inter- and intra-specific comparisons. For example, plant biologists can use the annotation database to discover candidate genes from other species and compare the annotations to anatomy, growth stage and phenotypes supplemented with experimental evidence based on gene expression and analysis of mutants. Plant breeders on the other hand, are limited by the number of crosses they can make in a season and need to plan quickly. Therefore, tools built around the OMICs data and ontology-based annotations can help accelerate the process of identifying potential breeding targets, genetic markers, or previously evaluated germplasm with potential genetic underpinnings of agronomic traits, can help accelerate genetic gain by reducing downtime between genetic crosses. The ability to perform semantic queries on traits of interest is vital to this task. Also facilitated by the Planteome, one can identify germplasm and associated characters that would otherwise be housed in an obscure or poorly crossreferenced database and only tagged with free text descriptions, or unlinked vocabularies that represent a barrier to interoperability. The use of reference and species-specific ontologies for plants and the standardized annotations provided by the Planteome allows users the ability to leverage data from other studies and collaborate more efficiently.  

Future directions for the Planteome project include the development of a reference Plant Stress Ontology and the addition of more species-specific vocabularies. We will be launching a plant gene nomenclature and annotation portal where researchers would be able to add new genes and annotations and edit existing ones. The data collected from these efforts will be shared semantically with sequencing projects, sequence archives and publishers of scientific literature for useful integration and consistency. Database user interface enhancements will include refinement of evidence and evidence code/ECO-driven faceted searches. The standardized functional annotation of the gene products will be further developed to assign plant Panther (32) gene family-based annotations and confidence scores in the projected annotations. We are also working on expanding the Planteome activities in the development of novel tools for, (i) automated recognition and ontology-based annotation of plant parts and phenotypes captured in plant images for taxonomic data collection (33,34), high throughput phenotyping projects, literature mining (35) and (ii) visualization of complex ontology trees and annotated data knowledge graphs in a user friendly manner.

# ABSTRACT  

Soluble functional proteins may transform into insoluble amyloid fibrils that deposit in a variety of tissues. Amyloid formation is a hallmark of age-related degenerative disorders. Perhaps surprisingly, amyloid fibrils can also be beneficial and are frequently exploited for diverse functional roles in organisms. Here we introduce AmyPro, an open-access database providing a comprehensive, carefully curated collection of validated amyloid fibril-forming proteins from all kingdoms of life classified into broad functional categories (http://amypro.net). In particular, AmyPro provides the boundaries of experimentally validated amyloidogenic sequence regions, short descriptions of the functional relevance of the proteins and their amyloid state, a list of the experimental techniques applied to study the amyloid state, important structural/functional/variation/mutation data transferred from UniProt, a list of relevant PDB structures categorized according to protein states, database cross-references and literature references. AmyPro greatly improves on similar currently available resources by incorporating both prions and functional amyloids in addition to pathogenic amyloids, and allows users to screen their sequences against the entire collection of validated amyloidogenic sequence fragments. By enabling further elucidation of the sequential determinants of amyloid fibril formation, we hope AmyPro will enhance the development of new methods for the precise prediction of amyloidogenic regions within proteins.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Proteins are crucial macromolecules mediating most cellular functions and the majority of them have well-defined folded structures to serve these roles. If they fail to adopt or to remain in their native structural states and misfold, they are prone to aggregate and can form amyloid fibrils that are associated with a number of degenerative human disorders such as type II diabetes, Huntington’s and Alzheimer’s diseases and systemic amyloidosis (1–4). Amyloids are noncovalent fibrillar structures of extended, inter-molecularly hydrogen bonded $\upbeta$ -sheets that laterally self-assemble to yield insoluble, twisted fibrils typically of $10\ \mathrm{nm}$ in diameter, in which they are oriented perpendicular to the fibril axis. Due to this arrangement, the amyloid fold is often referred to as a cross $\upbeta$ -sheet structure (5,6). Multiple recent lines of evidence suggest that the amyloid state can also be beneficial for different functional purposes (7,8), such as bacterial and fungal biofilm formation (9–12), antimicrobial activity (13,14), the storage of peptide hormones (15) and the formation of the zona pellucida for the protection of mammalian and fish oocytes (16,17), among others. Besides these functional benefits, another reason why aggregation and amyloid fibril formation are maintained during evolution is that the regions involved are often part of the hydrophobic core of these proteins, and are thus required for them to fold correctly (18,19). Although amyloids play a key role in numerous important human diseases, the molecular mechanisms, the effects of mutations and changes in cellular milieu, the kinetics and the potential functionalevolutionary driving forces of amyloid fibril formation are only sparsely understood.  

The propensity for amyloid formation is encoded in the protein sequence, but a comprehensive, curated and regularly updated database that stores known amyloid precursor proteins and their amyloidogenic regions is still lacking. The AMYPdb database (20) which aimed to fulfil this role, contains only 33 amyloid precursor proteins forming mainly pathogenic amyloids in human, and was not updated since 2008. Other databases store information on the amyloid fibril-forming capacities of short peptides, for instance WaltzDB (21), while AmyLoad contains only a few amyloidogenic protein fragments (22). The recently published Curated Protein Aggregation Database (CPAD, (23)) is an integrated resource of aggregation data, but only stores the 33 amyloid precursor proteins that are also contained by the out-of-date AMYPdb, without any protein structure or amyloid classification information.  

In order to offer a more comprehensive and progressive online resource, we have collected proteins that have been demonstrated to form either pathogenic or functional amyloid fibrils or prions, with special focus on their amyloidogenic sequence regions through manually curated indepth literature mining. This functionally classified set of amyloid-forming proteins is made available in AmyPro and offers a significantly more detailed view than its peers, as it already contains 143 entries as of September 2017, out of which for 127 the amyloidogenic regions or prion domains are also defined. Our data collection pipeline enables continuous updates of the database through dedicated searches of the recent literature, in addition to inviting the scientific community to contribute to the project by submitting their published data via our user-friendly submission interface. AmyPro provides comprehensive information on the entry sequences, including the precursor proteins, experimentally validated amyloidogenic sequence regions, a short description of the functional relevance of their soluble and amyloid states, a list of the experimental techniques used to discover and investigate the amyloid state, structural/functional/variation/mutation annotations obtained from UniProt (24) and relevant, classified structures linking to the PDBe/RCSB/PDBj entry pages of the entries, with representative structures also displayed as static pictures for the fibrillar and/or soluble states with amyloidogenic regions highlighted in color. Additionally, AmyPro offers a sequence screening service allowing the users to screen their sequences of interest for matching fragments with the validated amyloidogenic regions stored in the database.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Data collection and classification  

The initial dataset incorporated the curated data of 33 amyloid precursor proteins from the Supplementary Data of Tsolis et al. (25). For many of these, e.g. calcitonin, apolipoprotein A-I, transthyretin and cystatin C, the annotated amyloidogenic regions were also updated based on recently published analyses (26–30). We then collected other proteins from the literature for which amyloid fibril formation was experimentally demonstrated, with the only exception of different variants of antibody light chains that are numerous and are already available in ALBase maintained by Boston University (http://albase.bumc.bu.edu/ aldb/). The amyloidogenic sequence regions were confirmed for most of the proteins, although in some cases this information was missing or the proposed region was only defined based on predictions. Such predictions were deemed to be of lower reliability, and thus for these cases the amyloidogenic regions were not defined on a residue level in AmyPro. Sixteen entries are for proteins that are known to be amyloidogenic, but their amyloid forming regions are not yet defined. It is also important to note that for amyloid-forming proteins and peptides that are ${<}45$ residues in length, for instance peptide hormones (15) and antimicrobial peptides (13,14), we did not necessarily require definition of an amyloidogenic region, but accepted the entire sequence as amyloidogenic. In the case of prions, we accepted full prion domains as amyloidogenic regions and also indicated shorter segments of the domain if those were explicitly defined as amyloidogenic core regions. AmyPro provides a flag to easily identify entries with prion domains in order to help users and method developers to distinguish them from better resolved amyloidogenic regions, since those display distinctly different length distributions and amino acid compositions (see the Stats page of AmyPro).  

The database stores the protein sequences investigated in the experiments addressing amyloid formation, which often lack initiator methionines, signal peptides and propeptides, and may comprise only a single domain compared to the corresponding UniProt entries (24). UniProt residue boundaries and information on the corresponding precursor protein are indicated. In a few cases where the wild-type protein does not form amyloid, but a mutant form does ( $31-$ 34), we included the mutated sequence into the database and clearly indicated the change compared to the corresponding UniProt entry sequence. The boundaries of amyloidogenic regions are provided with regard to both the displayed protein sequences and the corresponding UniProt entries. The collected amyloidogenic proteins were screened against the Protein Data Bank (35) to obtain available structural information on them. Similarly, they were mapped onto UniProt (24), from where the relevant sections of feature tables were retrieved, including e.g. variation data, providing detailed information on relevant disease mutations.  

The collected proteins were classified into five broad categories based on the proposed functions of their amyloid states in the literature: (i) pathogenic amyloids that are associated with known human diseases, (ii) functional amyloids that confer well-described functional benefits to the organism, (iii) functional prions that are self-propagating amyloid forms of proteins that confer functional benefits to the organism, (iv) amyloids whose functional relevance is not known and (v) biologically not relevant amyloids that were observed under conditions whose biological relevance is questionable. Besides the classification, a short description is provided for each entry that explains the function of the protein and the proposed role of its amyloid state.  

# Implementation  

AmyPro is implemented as an AngularJS web application fueled by the underlying data stored in multi-level JSON. The advantages of this technology are that it scales well with increasing data traffic and it enables responsive and dynamic behavior on multiple media, such as personal computers and hand-held devices.  

Each data record contains an entry ID, cross-references to other resources (PDBe (35), UniProt (24), PubMed), source organism, protein name and sequence, alternative names for both the investigated and the parent protein (if relevant) and the recommended amyloid name (if relevant), mutations (if relevant), functional classification, a list of the experimental techniques applied to study the amyloid state and the actual amyloidogenic sequence region(s). Where available, determined structures grouped according to relevant protein states are also provided as direct links to the corresponding wwPDB pages.  

Data can be accessed via either the online user interface, direct URLs serving up FASTA or raw TXT formats and a RESTful API serving JSON, for example http://amypro. net/data/entries/AP00017.txt directly provides the data of entry AP00017 in TXT format, and http://amypro.net/data/ entries/AP00007.json displays entry AP00007 in JSON.  

# RESULTS  

The AmyPro database (http://amypro.net) greatly improves accessibility to amyloid data both in a qualitative and quantitative sense, by providing 143 carefully curated, experimentally validated amyloid fibril-forming proteins (as of September 2017), including 127 with defined amyloidogenic regions totaling 5819 residues (2587 in prion domains and 3232 in annotated shorter amyloidogenic fragments). It is important to emphasize that AmyPro only contains aggregating proteins that form amyloids/prions, but it is not intended to host proteins implicated in phase separation or in forming amorphous aggregates. Data collection will continue in order to maintain a regularly updated online resource, with the goal of periodic releases twice every year. To this end, we also kindly invite the scientific community to contribute by sending data using our online submission interface (http://www.amypro.net/#/submit). AmyPro currently includes 57 pathogenic and 54 functional amyloids, 17 functional prions and 15 cases where the role of the amyloid state is not known or has only been observed under non-native conditions and thus was considered as biologically not relevant. Apolipoprotein A-I is an illustrative example (http://www.amypro.net/#/entries/AP00003) of the increased quality of our database: the amyloidogenic region was previously loosely defined to residues 1-93 (25), but is now redefined to a 14-residue stretch following a recent publication (30).  

# User interface and website features  

The online user interface of AmyPro offers convenient ways to access the amyloidogenic data. The database can be browsed and searched by clicking on the respective button on the top navigation bar. While browsing, the displayed entry list can be filtered by category (pathogenic, functional prion, functional amyloid, unknown, biologically not relevant) and by typing in filtering terms, such as a speciesor protein name. Similarly, searching can be performed by typing in a search term, and then the results may be further refined by adding species name or category. Examples of search terms are AmyPro or UniProt IDs, protein/gene names or species.  

Both browsing and searching results are displayed as lists of relevant entries arranged as a table. Clicking on any row will direct the user to the dedicated entry page. Clicking on the plus signs on the left hand side allows the user to select multiple entries, and then perform a batch download in JSON format by pressing the ‘Download selected’ button.  

Searching can also be performed using an input sequence on the search screen. Pasting a sequence and pressing ‘Match’ will run a screening process and return all those entries where at least six consecutive residues match any segment within the user input. Again, clicking on any row in the results table will lead to the entry page.  

In addition to accessing specific entries, the complete dataset is also available for download in three different data formats. Pressing the ‘Download’ button on the top navigation menu displays a drop-down menu from which the data format can be selected. AmyPro is currently available for download in JSON, FASTA and raw TXT formats.  

We invite the scientific community to submit their own published data by filling in our user-friendly online submission form. Clicking on the ‘Submit’ button on the top navigation bar directs the user to this form.  

Finally, we provide database statistics (sequence length distributions and amino acid compositions) on the ‘Stats’ page, and an online documentation of all the functionalities of AmyPro on the ‘Help’ page, both accesses using the top navigation menu.  

# Accession pages  

Each database entry can be investigated in detail by accessing its dynamically generated entry page via browsing, searching or direct URL links (Figure 1).  

On the top of each entry page, the entry ID is displayed along with the name of the protein, the International Society of Amyloidosis (ISA) recommended name of the derived amyloid (36) with smaller letters (if relevant), and the classification of the regions (pathogenic, functional prion, functional amyloid, unknown, biologically not relevant). This section also provides the alternative names, the source organism and the precursor/parent protein with its respective alternative names (where relevant), the related publications and direct links to download the data in TXT, FASTA or JSON formats. Below this section a brief, amyloid state-centric description of the entry is provided followed by the corresponding UniProt functional description that describes the parent protein if not explicitly stated otherwise. The next two sections provide information on the functional classification of the amyloid form and a list of the experimental techniques by which it was discovered/ studied in the listed publications.  

The investigated protein sequence (as provided by the authors) is displayed below, with the corresponding UniProt accession and residue boundaries provided in brackets and amyloidogenic regions colored according to their category’s color code.  

Below the data visualization, the actual amyloidogenic region and prion domain sequences are displayed in addition to their residue indices (corresponding to the entry sequence and the UniProt sequence) and links to the corresponding literature references. If in different publications overlapping segments were claimed amyloidogenic, those were merged to obtain our AmyPro amyloidogenic

Figure 1. AmyPro entry screen. AmyPro provides all the relevant information on specific entry pages. In addition to displaying data, these pages also offer direct download links (TXT, FASTA and JSON formats) as well as data visualization by mapping the amyloidogenic regions or prion domain of the given entry protein onto available structural data and functional annotations (imported from PDBe and UniProt, respectively).  

segments and all the supporting publications are provided. The bottom section of the entry pages show important UniProt features after pressing the ‘Click to load Feature Viewer’ button, using the recently released visualization tool of UniProt, ProtVista (37), extending it with AmyPro data. Using this tool, the AmyPro sequence and amyloidogenic regions can easily be compared to various features, such as protein processing data, structural features, PTMs and variations (each corresponding to an extendable line in the table). When applicable, relevant PDB IDs grouped into fibrillar (including structures of short cross- $\cdot\upbeta$ spines with varied steric zippers), precursor and soluble states, also distinguishing wild-type, segment, mutant and complex forms within the soluble state are listed below. These PDB IDs link to the corresponding PDBe/RCSB/PDBj entry pages. Representative PDB structures of the soluble wild-type and/or fibrillar forms are also displayed (in the absence of the full-length soluble wild-type sequence, a relevant segment of the protein may be displayed), with the amyloidogenic regions highlighted. Finally, at the bottom of the entry page, a web component is displayed that maps every available PDB structure to the UniProt ID, while also displaying Pfam entities. This web component was developed and is maintained by PDBe in their component library (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdb-component-library/).  

# DISCUSSION  

AmyPro is a novel, carefully curated database of amyloid precursor proteins and their amyloidogenic sequence regions that aims to provide an up-to-date view of the entire amylome. It contains significantly more amyloid-forming proteins than any of its peers, mainly due to incorporating validated functional amyloids and prion proteins from all kingdoms of life for the first time. AmyPro will be regularly updated, relying not only on data submissions from the research community but also on regular internal updates based on scanning newly published amyloid literature. By storing the most comprehensive list of amyloid fibrilforming proteins published so far in combination with a useful set of features facilitating their efficient analysis, we anticipate AmyPro to become central to amyloid research, and to have major impact on its progress. To achieve this goal we are dedicated to ensure the long-term availability of the database.  

In particular, AmyPro has huge potential in helping to elucidate the sequential determinants of amyloid fibril formation. Furthermore, the provided functional classifications might enable refining these sequential determinants according to the biological functions of amyloid fibrils and understanding the functional relevance of their differences. Better definition of the sequence determinants of amyloid fibril formation will also help in understanding and predicting the effects of mutations within amyloidogenic sequence fragments and relate them to the underlying molecular mechanisms, which in turn may enable the development of novel methods for more accurate computational identification of amyloidogenic regions within proteins.  

# AVAILABILITY  

AmyPro is available at http://amypro.net and is open to submissions from the scientific community.

# ABSTRACT  

BARD, the BioAssay Research Database (https:// bard.nih.gov/) is a public database and suite of tools developed to provide access to bioassay data produced by the NIH Molecular Libraries Program (MLP). Data from 631 MLP projects were migrated to a new structured vocabulary designed to capture bioassay data in a formalized manner, with particular emphasis placed on the description of assay protocols. New data can be submitted to BARD with a user-friendly set of tools that assist in the creation of appropriately formatted datasets and assay definitions. Data published through the BARD application program interface (API) can be accessed by researchers using web-based query tools or a desktop client. Thirdparty developers wishing to create new tools can use the API to produce stand-alone tools or new plug-ins that can be integrated into BARD. The entire BARD suite of tools therefore supports three classes of researcher: those who wish to publish data, those who wish to mine data for testable hypotheses, and those in the developer community who wish to build tools  

# that leverage this carefully curated chemical biology resource.  

# INTRODUCTION  

High-throughput screening enables rapid measurement of the effects of large numbers of small molecules on biochemical or cell-based biological systems. Such experiments result in large datasets, containing thousands to millions of measurements, which enable identification of candidate small molecules for further development as tool compounds or drug leads. Several bioassay data-storage and data-analysis systems exist that serve the chemical biology, computational chemistry, and bioinformatics communities. The National Cancer Institute and Harvard Institute of Chemistry and Cell Biology partnered to develop ChemBank, a firstgeneration chemical biology data resource (1,2). ChemBank was built to house screening data and to provide a cheminformatics platform for analysis of those data. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) partnered to develop PubChem to provide a national deposition repository for related data emanating from the Molecular Libraries Program (MLP) (3,4), and to create tools enabling its use as a data-analysis portal. Recently, substantive updates have been made to the PubChem datasets and infrastructure, especially with the introduction of panel assays and a new categorized comment system that allows optional annotation of assays to comply with domain-specific data standards (5). The ChEMBL database (6,7) demonstrated the utility of annotating data consistently across experiments and crossreferencing compound targets against external databases, such as Gene Ontology (GO, (8)) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG, (9)).  

Despite these early successes in chemical biology data sharing, the management and reuse of these data has remained difficult due to a lack of standardization, particularly of assay descriptions, which prevents effective, structured query across datasets. While researchers reading the descriptive text of an analysis may not be hindered by such inconsistent annotations in different assays, crossassay computational analysis of datasets with inconsistent (or non-existent) meta-data is impossible. The lack of standardized metadata annotation therefore restricts analyses of the data to singleton datasets and prevents the systematic, unbiased survey of the entire contents of a database. Datasets such as those produced by the MLP are of high quality and scientifically valuable, but were not annotated or formatted consistently across screening centers despite a stated goal of MLP to analyze the resulting data collectively.  

In this report, we present BioAssay Research Database (BARD), a freely available system for registering and querying publicly accessible bioassay data. BARD was commissioned by the MLP to be the principal analysis environment housing screening data generated by its probe-development projects. It currently holds complete screening data for over 600 projects from program screening centers. These projects consist of primary high-throughput screens, confirmatory assays, and counter-screens testing on average over 150,000 compounds. Each project has been curated to conform to a flexible, consistent vocabulary that includes a standard representation and common language for organizing bioassays and their results. This curation has enabled systematic, cross-assay analysis of datasets regardless of the identity of the contributing center or individual data submitter. While other bioassay databases annotate their data with some shared terms, BARD uses a controlled vocabulary specifically developed to describe assay protocols. The data housed within PubChem lacks the consistent annotation required for effective search across datasets, especially analyses designed to reveal methodological connections between unrelated projects. Similarly, ChEMBL lacks extensive structured annotation of assays and assay protocols, making assembly of data from similar experiments difficult. These unstructured data are not well-suited to computational search and analysis across assays and projects. BARD is a tool that researchers can use to share chemical biology data and develop hypotheses on the influence of chemical probes on biological systems, suggesting future experiments to pursue.  

# RESULTS  

BARD supports three distinct research audiences: assaydata depositors, data miners, and software developers (Figure 1). Depositors can publish their bioassay data using a guided data-entry tool that assists them, ensuring that new  

BARD supports several different groups of users records are well-structured and complete. Researchers can then mine these newly deposited data as part of the full BARD database, using a powerful search interface and set of visualization and statistical tools. Developers can build new research tools either as standalone programs, or as plug-ins integrated into BARD using a well-documented application-programming interface (API).

Data miners can explore BARD data using several tools, developed both by BARD developers and the larger developer community (blue and green). Software developers can create new tools that access BARD data using the API and deploy them either as stand-alone tools or as plug-ins that can be integrated into the BARD website (green and orange).  

# Data migration and structure  

We curated and migrated $630{\mathrm{~MLP}}$ datasets from PubChem into BARD. This data-migration process involved converting project metadata to the BARD structured vocabulary and ensuring a consistent data structure across all assays. Though we built tools to partially automate this process, manual intervention was required to successfully import most assay protocols. Curators interpreted free-text PubChem entries and refactored those metadata using the BARD vocabulary. Following initial migration using automated scripts, annotations and changes were reviewed by MLP scientists involved in the original experiments (Table 1). In addition, long-form free-text was migrated along with the curated meta-data. This migration and curation process served as the template for the data-entry tools that are now built into BARD.  

The BARD vocabulary was built to address the problem of inconsistent, incomparable annotations between datasets. Complex queries of bioassay data require a common vocabulary and consistent data structures across all assays. Because such structures were previously unavailable or under-developed, we created an extensive formal vocabulary and term hierarchy for BARD (10). For example, because PubChem allows capture of context items in free-text fields, the concept of “percent inhibition at $10\upmu\mathrm{M}^{\upprime\upprime}$ is represented semantically 1,800 different ways in the various MLP depositions in that database. Formulating a search function that can accommodate all of these variants in a single query is difficult. After curation to unify these annotations under the BARD vocabulary, however, a search could include the criterion of “percent inhibition at $10~\upmu\mathrm{M}^{\upprime\upprime}$ and reasonably expect to retrieve all assays that included any one of the 1,800 semantic variations of the same concept. This standardization of metadata terms was done across all of the metadata in the $630{\mathrm{~MLP}}$ datasets.

The BARD vocabulary ensures preservation of the meaning of assay definitions, while also providing flexibility, extensibility, and maintainability. The vocabulary is modifiable and enforces consistent naming of annotations, such as for cell lines, avoiding some limitations inherent to freetext data. The vocabulary alleviates the problem of different research groups using multiple different names for the same concept or entity (https://bard.nih.gov/BARD/ element/showTopLevelHierarchyHelp). The BARD vocabulary leverages and references established external ontologies wherever possible, including BioAssay Ontology (BAO) (11,12), GO, and KEGG. It includes dedicated data structures for information like incubation times, compound concentrations, and assay types. Further, storage of these data in dedicated fields means that queries can require that a search term belong to a particular data type, rather than the merely requiring the existence of a term in any free-text descriptive field.  

# Technology  

BARD comprises several independent modules integrated by APIs. The data-entry component of BARD is integrated into the BARD website, and built with the Grails web-development framework (https://grails.org/). Layout support was implemented using Twitter Bootstrap (http: //getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/). Data entered into BARD are first checked for data consistency using business rules and then stored in an Oracle database. An extract-transformload (ETL) process transfers the curated data from this database to a data warehouse, which stores the data in a form optimized for fast query. The warehouse is a MySQL (http://www.mysql.com/) database supported by Solr (http: //lucene.apache.org/solr/) for fast search. Fast chemical structure search in BARD is supported by a custom, inmemory solution that can scale to very large databases (https://tripod.nih.gov/? $\scriptstyle\gamma=361$ ). Local copies of the GO and KEGG databases are also stored, for fast access by auto-complete functions.  

A representational state transfer (REST) API (https:// github.com/ncats/bard/wiki) mediates all transactions with the warehouse database and returns JSON-formatted data. This API is the primary access point for the data warehouse and supports queries from the Web Query tool and the Desktop Client. The API also supports a plug-in system, allowing external developers to create new functionality that can be added to the BARD core API. It is implemented using Java servlets and provides a REST interface to the BARD data warehouse. The REST interface employs the Jersey (https://jersey.java.net/) library to provide the requisite scaffolding and routing mechanisms. Jackson (http://jackson.codehaus.org/) is employed to support processing of JSON documents, which is the primary response format for the bulk of the API.  

The browser-based query client hosts a wide variety of query and data-mining functions for browsing and searching the data stored in the data warehouse. The query client was built using Grails and Javascript, with D3-based graphics (http://d3js.org/), and communicates with the data warehouse via the API. This tool supports predictive text searching, and returns a full set of results for those queries from all compounds, assays, and projects stored within the data warehouse (see Supplementary Information).  

The code developed for BARD is free and open-source, and is available on GitHub (see Supplementary Information). Some functions of BARD rely on non-opensource components. Rendering of compound structures within the web interface is provided by the free but closed-source JChem API from ChemAxon (http://www. chemaxon.com/products/jchem-base/). The structure editor is from Scilligence (http://www.scilligence.com/web/ jsdrawapis.aspx), and requires a license to be used on a newly-deployed version of BARD. Without this license, only the structure-editing components of BARD are unavailable. The BARD data-entry tool is supported by an Oracle database (http://www.oracle.com/), and so an Oracle license, held by many institutions, is required for installation and operation of a new instance of BARD.

Figure 2. Loading data into BARD. New screening experiments can be entered into BARD using the web-based data-entry tool, available on the BARD website. The BARD UI guides the user through the process of creating an assay protocol to describe the experimental design. It then creates an upload template file that contains all of the required fields necessary to deposit a completed set of experimental results.  

# Depositors  

New assay data are entered into BARD directly within a web browser. The BARD website includes a data-entry system that guides data submitters in adding new data to BARD such that it is properly structured and can be included in cross-assay queries (Figure 2). The data-entry interface supports the BARD structured vocabulary by checking input data against the vocabulary and business rules of the assay data standard. User-friendly tools such as auto-suggest and an annotation checklist guide scientists through this process to reduce the effort associated with structuring assay descriptions and ensuring consistent results. A video tutorial demonstrating the structure of the data in BARD and the process of entering data is available online (https://github.com/broadinstitute/BARD/wiki/ Video-Demonstrations).  

Each experiment entered into BARD is assigned an assay definition, a description of the experiment that includes information such as the assay format (cell-based, biochemical, etc.) and the biological target. When a new assay definition is created, the UI creates basic context items common to all assay definitions. These context items can be entered with further guidance from the UI in the selection of appropriate values for those items: BARD will attempt to auto-complete text entered into the fields with appropriate BARD vocabulary terms. When existing vocabulary terms are not sufficient, new terms can be added. If an identifier from an external database is required (e.g., Uniprot or Entrez Gene ID) the user interface will also ensure valid identifiers are entered. Once completed, an assay definition can be stored and re-used for other experiments.

Figure 3. The Project Flow Diagram. The Project Flow Diagram illustrates the relationships between experiments in a project. Experiments like primary screens can be connected to downstream experiments, like confirmatory assays and counter-screens.  

Once an assay definition is created or chosen from a list of existing assay definitions, BARD will generate a custom tab-delimited text file template that can be used to upload assay result data. Completed experiments can then be linked to other experiments in the project to create a project flow diagram, summarizing the experimental workflow employed by the project team (Figure 3). Properly formed data are transferred to the data warehouse on a daily basis.  

# Data miners  

The data stored in BARD are accessible to the public via three avenues: the browser-based Web Query Client (including plug-ins), the Desktop Client, and third-party standalone applications built by the developer community. Each of the tools allows researchers to retrieve high-quality structured data from BARD.  

The Web Query Client features an initial interface built around a single search bar. This search tool offers autosuggest options for targets, gene names, KEGG pathways, GO terms, and other terms from the controlled vocabulary or referenced external ontologies. Queries are performed against the entire database, and results are returned for assay definitions, compounds, projects, and experiments in separate search tabs. These results can be examined and filtered by a variety of criteria such as protein target, GO biological process term, or assay format. Individual items can be stored for later comparison in the Query Cart, a user session-specific storage tool. Results can then be visualized using the web client’s built-in Molecular Spreadsheet (Figure 4a) or by downloading to the BARD Desktop Client (Figure 5). The Query Cart can also be used as a workspace, where compounds, assay definitions, and projects can be added and removed as the user progressively refines their search criteria.  

Compound search results summarize the number of hits each component has had in BARD-curated assays. Compounds, projects, or assay definitions can be selected and added to the Query Cart for further analysis. In the Molecular Spreadsheet, the detailed results for compounds in various assay definitions can be viewed in a format similar to traditional structure–activity relationship (SAR) tables: a matrix format of compounds versus biology (assay definitions and experiments).  

The utility of data curated with well-structured controlled vocabularies is evident in the Linked Hierarchy visualization component of the Web Query Client tool (Figure 4b). The Linked Hierarchy is a set of sunburst or pie charts displaying annotations that describe the current selected compound. The first chart shows the distribution of biological process terms associated with the assays in which the compound was tested. The second chart shows the format of those assays, the third the protein class of the presumed target of those assays, and the fourth the assay type. These four charts are linked; clicking on a pie slice in one chart selects the assays associated with that annotation, and the remaining three charts change layout to display the annotation composition of those selected assays as well. Clicking on the drill-down icon below one of the charts opens up the sunburst display that visualizes the data as a hierarchy (Figure 4b). These trees are strict hierarchies, with each child item having only one parent. Each item in the sunburst representation of these trees is selectable, allowing the user to select a set of terms based on their belonging to a child category of some given parent. By selecting various criteria in each of the pie and sunburst charts, one can make associations between the provided annotations. A video demonstration of the use of the Linked Hierarchy and the Molecular Spreadsheet to generate hypotheses is available online (https://github.com/broadinstitute/BARD/wiki/ Video-Demonstrations).  

Pre-publication or proprietary data can be compared to public BARD data using the BARD Desktop Client. The tool matches the user’s compound structures to those present in the BARD data warehouse by making a hash key of the structure; that hash is compared to the hash keys of BARD compounds so no private structure data need be passed over the network. The Desktop Client is then able to download and present BARD data alongside private data (Figure 5). Since the Desktop Client is run locally, it is not limited by the browser and can load more data than a browser-based tool. It can save queries for later use and will automatically update all downloaded information, ensuring that the data are always up to date. Furthermore, the user can export data held in the Desktop Client to thirdparty applications using the industry-standard structuredefinition file (SDF) format.

Figure 4. The Web Query Client results. Rich search results are available in the Web Query Client. (a) The Molecular Spreadsheet displays a summary table of characteristics of selected compounds, including structure, active versus inactive counts, a complete record of the assays and experiments in which the compounds were active, the concentrations at which they were active, and dose–response curves when they are available. (b) The Linked Hierarchy enables investigation of compound annotations. The individual pie or sunburst charts summarize the number of compound hits from assays broken down by several different criteria: biological process, assay format, protein target class, and assay type. These charts are interactive: clicking on an item in the sunburst causes the sunburst to be redrawn to show only those items belonging to the selected item and its children. The remaining three pie charts are also redrawn to display the distribution of items that belong to the selected assay results.  

# Developers  

The BARD Web Query Client and Desktop Client, while offering functionality to the majority of potential users, are unlikely to support all of the possible needs of all researchers. The BARD API provides two paths for developers to add functionality to BARD: by creating stand-alone tools, and by creating plug-ins that can be deployed as part of the BARD website. The API provides eleven top-level resources that correspond to all the main entities that represent BARD datasets (projects, assays, experiments, etc.). It has complete access to the underlying BARD database, allowing queries of assay data for selected compounds and targets, as well as SAR analyses. Finally, the API is extensible, in that user-contributed code, termed plug-ins, can be deployed within the BARD architecture and presented as a seamless part of the API hierarchy. Since the plug-ins are deployed within the BARD infrastructure, they have direct access to the BARD data warehouse. Links to the full documentation for plug-in development are documented as Supplementary Information.  

BARD’s plug-in architecture supports a community of researchers that develop new functionality that can be integrated into the BARD website. At least six plug-ins have already been written, including BADAPPLE (Figure 6) (13), a compound promiscuity calculator, and SmartCyp, a tool for predicting compound metabolism by cytochrome P450 (14). This plug-in system creates, in effect, a computational community platform, allowing expansion of the BARD ecosystem of tools and encouraging community involvement in the mining and sharing of bioassay data (see Supplementary Information).  

# DISCUSSION  

BARD addresses a need for a curated, well-structured database to house the wealth of bioassay data produced by the enormous MLP effort in a form that allows effective cross-assay query and analysis. BARD curators have collectively annotated and uploaded over 600 projects, resulting in a data resource unique in its size, quality, and utility. We have improved on existing resources for managing and querying these data by properly annotating and restricting the data inputs to a controlled, yet extensible, vocabulary. The migration process drove the creation of the data-entry component of the BARD web application, resulting in a tool that simplifies the deposit of new data and results in high-quality, well-structured datasets. To support the use of these data, we built a series of data-mining and data-visualization tools as well as an API for programmatic access. These new resources serve three distinct segments of the chemical biology research community: assay data depositors, data miners, and software developers.  

The user interface supporting data deposition simplifies the important task of publishing and integrating experimental results and metadata. Data depositors can contribute their experimental data to the BARD database and benefit both themselves and the research community. Upon deposition into BARD, new data immediately become more useful, not just to the research community that gains access to those data, but to the depositor. Because of the consistent structure and restricted vocabulary used in BARD, new datasets are immediately made more powerful by their association with the existing MLP reference dataset. Such data are now useful to the public and more useful to the researcher who deposited them.

Figure 5. The Desktop Client. The Desktop Client downloads data stored in the user’s Query Cart, and displays it alongside local, private data for further analysis. (a) The compound-level information is displayed in a tabular format similar to Web Query Client results and includes compound structure and promiscuity information as well as compound class and full name. (b) The Assays tab summarizes results for the selected compound in each assay, displaying dose–response curves and other summary statistics.  

The existing data within BARD is also improved by new data depositions: only searches need be re-run and will automatically include results from newly added data. Furthermore, the data within BARD are improved when updates to established data resources are made available. For instance, when the GO database is updated, it is automatically integrated into BARD and associations of both old and new bioassay data are made with the updated ontology.  

The extensive data-access and data-analysis tools within the Web Query Client, Desktop Client, and the various plug-ins support researchers in mining the data and generating hypotheses. With these tools, researchers can learn about themes in compound activity (e.g., investigating enrichment of kinase-inhibitory compounds for various target biological processes). The Linked Hierarchy promotes concise, rapid search, sort, and visualization of these data in a way that allows filtering of multiple fields, allowing hypotheses to be generated and refined rapidly. The Desktop Client allows the investigation of private or very large datasets alongside publicly available ones.

Figure 6. The BADAPPLE plug-in is embedded within the BARD website. The BADAPPLE plug-in accesses the BARD data warehouse using the REST API and implements the plug-in interface, allowing it to be deployed as part of the BARD website. The results are then displayed as part of the compound details. BADAPPLE predicts compound scaffold promiscuity using assay information about compounds containing that scaffold.  

Finally, the data contained within BARD’s structured warehouse can be harnessed by new tools developed by the community––the larger population of researchers and developers––through the use of the API. New tools, either stand-alone or deployed as part of the BARD website, can leverage the structure of the BARD data and expand the analyses available to the greater research community. The extensible plug-in architecture allows a new community of tool builders to form around the data.  

We built BARD with an understanding of the importance of data sharing in the screening and chemical biology research community, and so we designed it to ease the process of data-deposition with a high-quality data-entry toolkit. Further, we recognize that depositing data into a public repository is often not a high priority for researchers, so we built a system that has value to the data depositor themselves, increasing the power of a researcher’s own data because of the context provided by the larger BARD dataset. We hope that these tools will encourage the submission of many future datasets to BARD. In summary, we created a powerful query engine for hypothesis generation and probe development, including data and access tools that can make probe discovery faster, cheaper and easier, leading to improvements in human health.

# ABSTRACT  

Genome-wide association studies have provided a vast array of publicly available SNP $\times$ phenotype association results. However, they are often in disparate repositories and formats, making downstream analyses difficult and time consuming. PheLiGe (https://phelige.com) is a database that provides easy access to such results via a web interface. The underlying database currently stores ${\tt>}75$ billion genotype–phenotype associations from 7347 genome-wide and 1.2 million region-wide (e.g. cis-eQTL) association scans. The web interface allows for investigation of regional genotypephenotype associations across many phenotypes, giving insights into the biological function affected by the variant in question. Furthermore, PheLiGe can compare regional patterns of association between different traits. This analysis can ascertain whether a co-association is due to pleiotropy or linkage. Moreover, comparison of association patterns for a complex trait of interest and gene expression and protein levels can implicate causal genes.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have discovered thousands of associations between genetic variants and a multitude of human complex traits, yielding novel insights into human biology. Efficient cross-referencing of a genetic variant with a wide range of phenotypes––phenome scans––allows for identification of the phenotypic action spectrum of a specific genetic locus. Knowledge of such spectra could provide insights into biological function affected by variation in a genetic region, guide functional studies (1), allow formulation of aetiologic hypothesis, facilitate identification of therapeutic intervention targets and inform about potential efficacy and safety of targeting specific molecules and pathways (2). Currently, there are several publicly available tools that allow characterisation of effects of genetic variants across phenotypes studied in the context of human genetic association studies (3–6).  

When generating a functional hypothesis about the mechanism of action of a specific variant associated with a trait, we are interested in learning the spectrum of the variant’s pleiotropic effects. An observation of a (significant) association between a SNP and more than one phenotype could mean that all these phenotypes are affected by the same underlying causal variant (pleiotropy). In contrast, such an association could also occur due to several causative variants in linkage disequilibrium, that each affect their own subset of traits (7).  

Here, we present a large database with a web interface that allows not only for scanning the phenome for effects of a genetic variant, but also to assess whether co-association of a variant with multiple traits may occur due to pleiotropy or as a consequence of linkage. We name our interactive database PheLiGe to reflect our hope that it will facilitate Phenome Linking to the Genome.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Data aggregation and processing  

Prior to making data available via the PheLiGe web interface, we performed several pre-processing steps (see Figure 1). Publicly available GWAS summary statistics files were obtained from the internet. For each file, we created an annotation that contains information about study design and its key characteristics (sample size, details of association analysis mode, study population, license and use terms, etc.). For complex traits and diseases we matched trait names with terms from the Experimental  

![](images/c622c3b4b7b4eb46e07884773725c1fd5f25f55fc05d8daaefd028601c98a07a.jpg)  
Figure 1. Schema illustrating data processing. Integration module assists with conversion of summary statistics into universal format and with quality control (QC). Reference is used for SNP checking and filtration. If summary statistics pass QC test, they, together with metadata, are uploaded to the databases (the DB module). Finally, data become available to an external user via a web interface.  

Factor Ontology (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/efo) as well as with the International Classification of Disease (ICD, revision 10) notation and code. For matching with EFO ontology terms we used mapping service ZOOMA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/zooma/) and manual curation. For eQTL studies the transcript names were mapped to HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee gene names, that were added as a part of the trait name. For studies of levels of N-glycans we used the standard Oxford notation as a part of a trait’s name.  

Since the data were generated by different groups using different protocols, the resulting summary statistics files have different formats. To solve this problem, we developed an integration module that transforms data into a universal format (see Supplementary information). To ensure consistency of data within the database, our import procedure compares information about the SNP identification number, its position in the genome, and alleles to the reference. If any of the characteristics do not match, the SNP is not imported. The present implementation uses the reference that consists of 503 genomes of Europeans from the ‘1000 genomes’ project (1000G phase 3 version 5 (8)). Next, we harmonized the data, so that the same effect and reference alleles are used in all GWASs. If a summary statistics file did not directly contain all columns that are required for conversion to the universal format, in certain cases, a GWAS could still be imported into the database. For example, missing allele frequency could be replaced with that from the reference; missing standard error could be computed based on the effect size and a $P$ -value.  

Next, we perform quality control (QC) for each study. In particular, QC includes a comparison of the frequencies of alleles from the study with those from the reference sample, a comparison of the reported $P$ -values and $P$ -values computed from the reported effect size and its standard error, and an analysis of the distribution of estimates of the allele effects. We also estimate and report the trait’s variance and genomic control factor. SNPs are marked as outliers if the reported allele frequency deviates from the reference panel allele frequency by $>0.2$ , or in case the reported and computed association $\log_{10}$ ( $P$ -value) differ by more than $2\%$ for $P-$ -values $<10^{-10}$ and by more than the absolute value of 0.5 for $P$ -values $>10^{-10}$ . Only summary statistics for SNPs passing the QC are uploaded to the databases.  

The PheLiGe database consists of two parts: ClickHouse (https://clickhouse.tech) is used to manage summary-level genetic association data, and PostgreSQL (http://www. postgresql.org) is used to manage study meta-data.  

# Colocalization analysis  

For analysis of colocalization of signals of association from different traits, we implemented a slightly modified version of the  metric defined by Momozawa et al. (9) (see Supplementary information for full description). In short, this method compares ‘profiles’ of association of two traits in some region. Often, two traits are associated with the same locus, however, the patterns of association are different, suggesting that functional elements affecting the two traits are distinct, although are located nearby. When the patterns of association are similar, one can not rule out a hypothesis that the same functional element may affect both traits (pleiotropy).  

Thus, based on colocalization analysis user can determine whether two different traits may be under the control of the same functional variant(s) in the locus (in the manuscript by Momozawa et al., the threshold $|\Theta|>0.7$ was suggested) or rather by different functional variants in linkage disequilibrium $|\Theta|\le0.7)$ .  

# RESULTS  

# Database content  

At the time of writing, the database of associations contains results from 7347 genome-wide and 1.3 million regionwide association scans. In total, the database contains about 75 billions of genotype-phenotype associations. More specifically, $37.6\%$ of the associations relate genetic variation to a wide range of complex traits and diseases, $48.3\%$ are related to proteomics, $10.5\%$ to transcriptomics, $1.9\%$ to metabolomics and $1.6\%$ to glycomics (see Supplementary Table S1). The current version of this summary information, together with information on the studies that are included in the database is available from the PheLiGe website.  

The comparison of the size and content of our database is presented in Supplementary Table S2. Our database is one of the biggest with 75 billions of associations in total. It is second next only to the PheWas (10) database; however, the 126 billions of associations in PheWas also include private data, that can not be accessed by the wide community. In contracts, all 75 billions of associations in our database are available for exploration by general public. Several collections distinguish our database from the rest. We are not aware of any other collection including CEDAR eQTL data on $\mathrm{CD14+}$ monocytes, $\mathrm{CD4+}$ T-lymphocytes, $\mathrm{CD8+}$ T-lymphocytes, $\mathrm{CD19+}$ B-lymphocytes, $\scriptstyle\mathrm{CD15+}$ granulocytes, platelets, rectum biopsies, transverse colon biopsies and ileum biopsies cell lines (9). Next, our database contains a large number of well-annotated N-glycomics GWAS.

# Web-interface  

For the convenience of a new user, we designed an interactive tour that demonstrates basic usage of PheLiGe. The tour is available via the ‘Start tour’ button in the upper right corner (see Figure 2). Below we shortly summarize the content and capabilities of the web interface.  

A user can access the database via a web interface with four tabs: ‘Associations’, ‘GWAS/cis-QTL Descriptors’, ‘Analysis’, ‘About’. In the ‘Associations’ tab a user can search for phenotypic associations observed for a SNP of interest, directly or via a proxy variant in LD. The search results will be presented as a table with several pages and sorted by association $P$ -value. A user can click on the ‘Open’ button in the ‘SNP plot’ column from this table to access the regional plot. In the pop-up window a user will see a regional association plot, a recombination map, and a gene track. In the regional association plot each dot represents a SNP. A user can filter SNPs by minor allele frequency (MAF) using the slider on the right. If a user navigates the cursor on the dot, she could see a tooltip with SNP information (chromosome, position, alleles, $P$ -value and others). Clicking on the rsID in the tooltip, a user will be redirected to NCBI SNP database, while clicking on the magnifier glass near rsID, the user will be redirected to the ‘Association’ tab and the database will be queried for this rsID. Next, using the button to the left to a trait name, a user can select a ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ traits, after which a colocalization analysis will be passed to the ‘Analysis’ tab. In this tab, regional patterns of association are compared using the colocalization analysis. The web interface provides interactive graphics for visual comparison of a region. For example, if $|\Theta|>0.7$ one should see a clear linear relation between the z-statistics of the primary and secondary trait (see Figure 2). In the ‘GWAS/cis-QTL Descriptors’ tab, the user can access association study meta-data and search for specific association studies. The search results are presented as a table. The gear icon located at the top right corner allows a user to select the fields she would like to see. From the ‘GWAS/cis-QTL Descriptors’ tab, a user can investigate a Manhattan plot for a trait of interest by clicking on the ‘Open’ button in the ‘Plot’ column. Then a pop-up window with the plot will appear. A user could select a chromosome and then she could navigate through the genome using the instruments presented on the left. The SNPs can be filtered by MAF using a slider on the right. At the highest level of resolution, each SNP will be represented by a dot. This view is identical to the regional plot view described above. The ‘About’ tab contains current summary information about the content of the database and documentation, where more detailed information about output tables and web interface usage can be found.  

# Case study of the use of the database  

To illustrate the use of PheLiGe, we have explored the variant rs7814941, which is strongly associated with back pain (11). We found that rs7814941 is associated with 26 other traits (at $P$ -value $<5\ \times\ 10^{-07}.$ ), including height, weight, disc problem, forced vital capacity and four eQTLs regulating expression of the GSDMC gene in different tissues (see Supplementary Table S3). However, study of colocalization shows that only for two traits––heel bone mineral density and disk problems––the regional association patterns were sufficiently similar ( $\mathrm{|\theta|}>0.7)$ to the back pain association pattern (see Supplementary information: Supplementary Figure S1). The similarity of regional genetic associations patterns of back pain and anthropometric traits was in general moderate (|| $\leq0.7\$ . These observations confirm the conclusion that the risk variants at the 8q41.21 locus lead to back pain through intervertebral disc degeneration, but not via the expression of the nearby GSDMC gene in the investigated tissues (12). This example clearly demonstrates that multiple associations do not necessarily imply pleiotropy and highlight the utility of our approach.  

# DISCUSSION  

We developed PheLiGe –– a database with a web interface, that allows lookups of phenotypic effects of a genetic variant across genome-wide and regional association scans, and exploration of the regional associations. The database already includes GWASs from many domains, such as complex quantitative traits and diseases, transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and glycomics. The database is regularly updated. The regional association patterns of different traits can be quantitatively compared, which may help distinguishing pleiotropy from linkage. PheLiGe can provide a user with insights into the biological function of genetic variants, help formulate hypotheses regarding aetiology and inform functional studies.  

In the future we plan to continue expanding the database. Up until now, the database has grown rapidly; for example, in June 2019 the number of genotype-phenotype associations was 36 billion, now, the database contains about 75 billions of associations. We expect that by the beginning of 2021 the size will grow to over 100 billions of associations, hopefully making it one of the largest publicly available databases of genotype-phenotype associations. Next, we plan to extend flexibility and usability of search queries. In particular, we will implement an opportunity of obtaining a list of top associations for specific traits and groups of traits; we also plan to add an ontology tree to make search queries more intuitive and flexible. Finally, we plan to implement personal accounts for users so that they could upload their own study results for private or public use.

# ABSTRACT  

Recent advances in sequencing technology have created unprecedented opportunities for biological research. However, the increasing throughput of these technologies has created many challenges for data management and analysis. As the demand for sophisticated analyses increases, the development time of software and algorithms is outpacing the speed of traditional publication. As technologies continue to be developed, methods change rapidly, making publications less relevant for users. The SEQanswers wiki (SEQwiki) is a wiki database that is actively edited and updated by the members of the SEQanswers community (http://SEQanswers. com/). The wiki provides an extensive catalogue of tools, technologies and tutorials for highthroughput sequencing (HTS), including information about HTS service providers. It has been implemented in MediaWiki with the Semantic MediaWiki and Semantic Forms extensions to collect structured data, providing powerful navigation and reporting features. Within 2 years, the community has created pages for over 500 tools, with approximately 400 literature references and 600 web links. This collaborative effort has made SEQwiki the most comprehensive database of HTS tools anywhere on the web. The wiki includes task-focused mini-reviews of commonly used tools, and a growing collection of more than 100

# INTRODUCTION  

Recent developments in sequencing technology have required wet-lab biologists and bioinformaticians to collaborate like never before. These new technologies are driving the rapid development of new software and algorithms for data analysis. Both biologists and bioinformaticians with a pressing need for computational tools now have a multitude of published software to choose from. However, more choice does not necessarily confer increased productivity. In contrast, choice can be confusing and can impair decision making (1). In addition, users without access to closed-source journals are deprived of opportunities to understand the tools published there.  

The rapid emergence of tools for HTS analysis is exceeding the capacity of an individual user, or even an individual institution, to monitor all the developments in the field. Funding often limits the ability of institutions to engage in such non-core activities. Traditionally, practices such as journal clubs have been used to educate researchers on current topics. However, in such a setting, the attendees are often confined to a geographical space, usually within an institution or local region. The limited number of topics per-session impedes knowledge transfer in a rapidly developing field. All these issues call for a robust system for rapid sharing of knowledge.  

As international collaboration in the sciences increases (2), community-curated databases and websites are gaining in popularity (3). Previously, ‘wikification’ of primary sequence databases such as GenBank has faced stiff resistance (4). GenBank, as an important archive of sequences and annotations, should be assured of content accuracy. However, in our opinion a small group of curators cannot fully encompass the collective expertise of the larger scientific community (5). Indeed, in order to allow for prompt error correction while maintaining content accuracy, Steven Salzberg suggested a layer of wiki be added to existing expert-curated databases (6). For example, a ‘wiki-track’ has been implemented in the UCSC Genome Browser for community annotation of UCSC genes and genomic locations.  

# The SEQanswers forum: a credible HTS community  

SEQanswers.com was founded as a central hub for technical communication about high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies. Consisting primarily of a forum, the SEQanswers community enables rapid dissemination of both wet-lab techniques and information regarding computational tools and analyses. The forum allows new tools, techniques and pipelines to be rapidly announced, tested, benchmarked and discussed within an active community. Over 20 000 registered users composed of a diverse mix of bioinformaticians, geneticists and molecular biologists, meet and share their experiences and tools. The forum is a broad, user-driven resource, focused on all aspects of high-throughput genomics. Participation is open to everyone, regardless of scientific background, institution or level of knowledge. Since its establishment in late 2007, the community has already been cited more than 10 times in high profile journals, including Nature, PLoS and Nucleic Acids Research.  

As a supplement to traditional forms of scientific communication, SEQanswers offers instantaneous sharing of ideas, findings and reviews between peers at the cutting edge of high-throughput genomics. The site has become an important resource for worldwide collaboration and education in the modern genomics era. SEQanswers allows interaction among bioinformatics analysts and between users and developers.  

Traditional software release, in the form of email announcements or on a tool’s website, require the users prior interest in the tool. SEQanswers allows any registered member to announce their own tools, even preliminary ones. Software developers thus reach a larger pool of potential users. Developer feedback via traditional channels is usually private. In contrast, SEQanswers users are encouraged to provide feedback in a public forum. Ideas are rapidly developed, practical and theoretical issues are debated. This process leads to improved software development.  

# The SEQanswers wiki: a structured wiki database for the SEQanswers community  

The SEQanswers wiki (SEQwiki) originated from a long running discussion thread in the SEQanswers forum, where an ever growing list of software was being maintained. Although the forum worked well for discussion, it lacked collaborative editing and categorization of resources. There was a high burden on the forum administrators to structure the information being added to the discussion. The wiki was initially started to distribute and organize this activity.  

The description of the wiki is the focus of the remainder of this publication.  

# SEQWIKI  

Broadly, the content of SEQwiki falls into three categories: (i) software, (ii) service providers and (iii) tutorials. Each of these three sections is described below.  

# A structured catalogue of bioinformatics tools  

SEQwiki is a structured catalogue of bioinformatics tools for HTS analysis that is actively maintained by the community. Pages for each tool include the tool’s data types, formats, capabilities and provenance. Each page is supplemented by links to publications and online resources. At the time of writing, the wiki provides information on more than 500 unique software tools, including approximately 400 references and 600 web links.  

Data is contributed in both structured and free text formats using either forms or regular ‘wiki text’, respectively. The form for adding or editing a tool was created in the wiki using the powerful Semantic Forms extension. In combination with Semantic MediaWiki and other extensions, SEQwiki functions as a database, allowing reports and queries to be issued over the data, and for advanced searching and navigation to be designed (for an example, see Figure 1).  

A simple form guides the user through the process of adding standardized data for a new bioinformatics application. The form has three main sections as follows:  

The summary section collects a short, free-text description of the tool, the main biological application domain(s), the bioinformatics analysis method(s) employed and the type(s) of compatible HTS technologies.   
The authorship section collects details about the tool’s authors, their associated institutions and its current status, maintained or not. Status defaults to ‘maybe’ to encourage user review of the available tools.   
The technical section collects details about the tool’s licence, file formats, programming language and the required operating system. These are important attributes for tool selection.   
. Finally, after saving the form, the user can review the page, and add relevant publications and URLs using sub-forms designed for this purpose.  

Forms created in the wiki use jQuery based autocompletion to help users to discover existing tools and find common values for the form fields. This helps to enforce data consistency, but doesn’t constrain users to a fixed set of options.  

Each tool is ‘tagged’ by the values entered in the various fields. A tool can have multiple values in each field, for example, a program for analysis of RNA sequencing could function as both a read aligner and as a tool to identify

Figure 1. The ‘Semantic Drilldown’ view of the bioinformatics applications in the wiki. In this screen-shot, values for four of the fields in the database are shown. The size of each value indicates the number of software packages tagged with that value (with the absolute count given in parenthesis). At a glance we can see that: software written in $\scriptstyle{\mathrm{C}}++$ dominates, followed by C, Java and then Perl. Most tools run in Linux, and most software tools are compatible with Illumina and 454 technologies. With just a few clicks, users can extract a list of tools meeting their exact criteria.  

splice-junctions. The full list of tools can be narrowed down using multiple parameters. A tool can be discovered in this way as long as any one of its attributes is matched (Figure 1).  

The tool pages present the entered data in a table on the right, with the ‘free text’ about the tool appearing on the left. The added links and literature references follow the free text. At the foot of each page, we include a standard table of links that allow the user to search for the tool in a variety of resources, including the SEQanswers forum. By linking back to the forum in this way, users are guided back to community discussion about the tool.  

Through tagging, bioinformaticians focusing on real data can quickly retrieve a collection of up-to-date tools for analysis, while tool authors will be able to find the most appropriate tools to benchmark their programs. The database helps to organize the underlying data, and lets users and developers concentrate on data analysis and development rather than finding the right tools for the right job.  

The quality and amount of information for each tool depends on the level of community participation. To help promote the improvement of pages for tools with little information, we have implemented a simple ‘article score’. The score increases for every field that is filled in for the description of the tool. Tools with low article scores are prominently displayed on the software hub page, along with the overall size of the article in bytes.  

# A directory of service providers  

SEQwiki hosts detailed information for more than one hundred HTS service providers from around the globe. Service providers are added in the same way as tools, using a specific form. On a summary page, the table of providers is dynamically generated, and is presented using the Exhibit results format. The resulting table of providers can be narrowed using Facets that cover the types of service provided and the geographic region of the provider.  

Finding a service provider geographically close to the user is of great importance to HTS users to ensure quick sample transfer and to maintain sample integrity. This section is invaluable for researchers without HTS core facilities in their own institution. Additionally, this section is for those curious about the current deployment of HTS facilities in different geographical locations.  

# An educational resource  

SEQwiki hosts several short, task-oriented articles or tutorials that compare the major tools in the areas of de novo genome assembly, de novo transcriptome assembly, sequence alignment and SNP calling methodologies. These task-oriented pages explain commonly used software along with their advantages, potential problems and technical requirements. The aim of these pages is to provide the community with continuous updates of bioinformatics software tools.  

# USAGE STATISTICS  

SEQwiki has grown steadily throughout its 2-year life (Figure 2). From Figure 2, it is clear that much content has been created during sporadic bursts of activity, but that there has been a trend of continuous growth at a lower level. Most of the largest bursts of activity occurred within the first year, after which growth is slower but still accounts for a significant number of new pages and revisions.  

The pattern of growth in Figure 2 is consistent with the activity of a few ‘super-users’ who make many edits or add many pages against a background of a much larger number of contributors who typically make very few edits (7). This observation is clearly shown again in Figure 3.  

![](images/9dfedbd60027c6620df63ff8fa74d5210d54badee1b8e5ddd3a462bb39e9fcad.jpg)  
Figure 2. The growth of SEQwiki since its inception in July 2009 until August 2011. The number of revisions per day (black) varies wildly during the 2-year period, from zero on many days to more than 100 on some days. The cumulative number of revisions is shown as the upper (red) trend. The lower green trend shows the cumulative number of pages in the wiki. Note that one ‘revision’ could be either an edit to an existing page or the creation of a new page.  

# FUTURE DIRECTIONS  

SEQwiki is an on-going project. The number of records in the wiki will continue to increase as new software tools are announced and published. The wiki has served as a successful platform providing searching capabilities on software tools for users. We plan to further enhance the features of the wiki. In particular, we would like to improve the following areas:  

(i) Community review system: before SEQanswers, user feedback was almost exclusively directed to software authors. Only a few disparate, well established or well-funded groups provided publicly archived mailing lists for community discussion. Software reviews by bloggers were similarly posted independently and relatively rarely. SEQanswers has fostered lively review of both pre-publication and post-publication tools. Usually, long before peer review publication, tools have been announced in SEQanswers and tested extensively within the community. Postpublication improvement and benchmarking among developers is encouraged by discussions in the SEQanswers forum. SEQwiki currently provides a quality metric by presenting the total view count of a tool’s page and the citation count of its associated publications. In future, functionality to provide detailed ratings and reviews could be added to the wiki.  

(ii) Community-wide benchmarking: Systematic benchmarking is a very important task that is rarely achieved. A few community-wide HTS benchmarking projects are currently underway, including the Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (CAGI), the Assemblathon (8), Genome Assembly Gold-Standard Evaluations (CAGE) and dbGASP. By using the wiki, we aim to distribute and ‘crowd source’ this type of data directly from the community. Data sets for benchmarking software tools could be hosted, and performance results could be collected by the community. Software developers would be motivated to provide information on their tools, and users would be motivated to feed back the results of their important individual and hitherto largely unpublishable experimentation.

Figure 3. The heavy tail of SEQwiki contributors. Most contributors make just one or only a few revisions, i.e. 68 users have only ever made one revision. In contrast, a few ‘super-users’ have made hundreds of revisions.  

(iii) Integration with the semantic web: there are several efforts to organize databases and software in the life sciences using ontologies, for example, the Software Ontology and the EDAM Ontology. The keywords describing software tools in SEQwiki could be organized using these controlled vocabularies. These data would be distributed over the semantic web using standards such as Resource Description Framework (RDF), which is integrated into Semantic MediaWiki. This approach allows reuse of data either directly on external web pages or by external tools that wish to query SEQwiki. Similarly, data could be queried from the semantic web and presented within SEQwiki.

# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  

The authors would like to thank everyone in the SEQanswers community, and everyone who contributed to the creation and curation of the wiki. DMB would like to thank ECO and KR for initial support of SEQwiki and JWL for writing the first draft of the manuscript.  

# CONCLUSION  

It has long been thought that wikis can play an important role for community annotation in the life sciences (9). An exhaustive list of BioWikis is available at The Bioinformatics Organization.  

SEQwiki is a community maintained wiki database that serves as a rapid, day-to-day reference for practitioners in the HTS field. The database refers users to tools and their publications. Community knowledge of tools is extensively discussed in the SEQanswers forum.  

SEQwiki is open to edit by an active community around the world. Registered members can submit and curate profiles of bioinformatics software tools. Similar to Wikipedia each modification in the wiki is associated with a registered user, and can be reverted if faulty information is found. Thanks to the active participation of the community, the wiki has met our goals to collect and categorize the ever growing list of bioinformatics software for HTS analysis.

# Abstract  

Molecular signatures are usually sets of biomolecules that can serve as diagnostic, prognostic, predictive, or therapeutic markers for a specific disease. Omics data derived from various high-throughput molecular biology technologies offer global, unbiased and appropriately comparable data, which can be used to identify such molecular signatures. To address the need for comprehensive disease signatures, DiSignAtlas (http://www.inbirg.com/disignatlas/ was developed o provide ranscriptomics-based signatures or a wide ange of diseases. A otal of 181 434 transcriptome profiles were manually curated from studies involving 1836 nonredundant disease types in humans and mice. Then, 10 306 comparison datasets comprising both disease and control samples, including 328 single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, were established. Furthermore, a otal of 3 775 317 differentially expressed genes n humans and 1 723 674 n mice were dentified as disease signatures by analysing transcriptome profiles using commonly used pipelines. In addition to providing multiple methods for the retrieval of disease signatures, DiSignAtlas provides downstream functional enrichment analysis, cell type analysis and signature correlation analysis between diseases or species when available. Moreover, multiple analytical and comparison tools for disease signatures are available. DiSignAtlas is expected to become a valuable resource for both bioscientists and bioinformaticians engaged in translational research.

# Introduction  

The rapid diagnosis and precise treatment of diseases, as well as the elucidation of disease pathogenesis, are among the major challenges in modern medicine. The discovery of disease-associated molecules, e.g. genetic variants, mRNAs, proteins, metabolites or other factors, plays a crucial role in addressing these challenges (1 . These molecules can serve as valuable diagnostic, prognostic, predictive and therapeutic markers for specific diseases. Consequently, numerous studies have been conducted to identify and characterize diseaseassociated molecules. Molecular signatures, which usually encompass sets of biological molecules, are instrumental in disease research. Importantly, such signatures can be derived from diverse omics data types, allowing a more comprehensive, unbiased and comparable approach to identifying relevant molecular patterns (2 . High-throughput sequencing technologies, including microarray, RNA-Seq, single-cell RNA-Seq scRNA-Seq) and single-nucleus RNA-Seq snRNASeq), enable the quantitative evaluation of gene expression to identify signatures of differential gene expression in diseases.  

In recent decades, the burgeoning field of omics data analysis has given researchers the ability to explore and compare vast datasets, hereby uncovering crucial molecular signatures associated with diseases. A vast number of studies have reported high-throughput transcriptomic data collected from various diseases, including cancers, and the raw data generated are deposited in databases such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (3  and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (4 . Although some databases, such as Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) (5  and BioXpress (6 , include archives of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with cancers, o our knowledge, here is currently no database that contains comprehensive omics-based signatures for various diseases other than cancers. The absence of a centralized data portal or disease signatures poses obstacles o exploring, cross-evaluating and comparing biomarkers across different diseases. This limitation has also hindered data mining efforts and made it difficult for researchers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular signatures associated with diverse diseases.  

In this study, raw data representing 181434 unique transcriptome profiles of disease and control tissues from humans and mice were manually curated from GEO, TCGA and ArrayExpress (3 4 7 . A total of 10 306 datasets related to 1836 nonredundant disease types, encompassing both disease and control groups, were meticulously organized and annotated. Among these datasets, 328 were derived from scRNA-Seq/snRNA-Seq experiments, offering singlecell comparisons. For each dataset, the raw data were reviewed and analysed systematically using standard pipelines to identify DEGs in various diseases. After this processing, 5498991 DEGs were identified and deposited as signatures of human and mouse diseases in the user-friendly database DiSignAtlas. This database provides downstream functional enrichment analysis, cell type analysis and improved, interactive data visualization. Therefore, DiSignAtlas can aid n dentifying commonalities and disparities in gene expression patterns, pathways and cellular responses among different disease types. In brief, DiSignAtlas offers the most comprehensive atlas available of human and mouse disease signatures based on bulk and single-cell transcriptomics to link diseases with DEGs, pathways, cell types and tissues to interrogate the mechanisms, diagnosis and treatment of diseases as well as gene unctions and disease models. We hope hat his database will become an invaluable data resource for researchers in their pursuit of improved diagnostics, treatments and overall understanding of diseases.  

# Materials and methods  

# DiSignAtlas workflow  

The workflow of DiSignAtlas 1.0 s llustrated n Figure 1 The methodology for constructing the database and guidelines for utilizing the web server are detailed below.  

# Data collection and processing  

We conducted manual searches n he GEO, ArrayExpress and TCGA (3 4 7  databases to identify human and mouse transcriptomics datasets related to specific diseases using diseaserelevant keywords. Subsequently, we ensured hat each dataset included both disease and control samples. Samples from a given study were categorized into ‘disease’ and ‘control’ groups and organized into a disease dataset with a disease type of nterest. For each disease-control dataset, disease samples should carry he disease of nterest, while controls should be independent of this disease. Although in most cases, controls represent normal conditions, they need not be in good health. If cases carry other disease(s), so do controls. Moreover, controls can carry the same disease as the disease group but of another grade/severity. In this case, the disease of interest could be labelled as ‘progressive disease’. The disease type of interest is a key feature of the dataset, while the disease all he samples carry s annotated as characteristic’ of he dataset. This entire process was carefully validated by at least two researchers. Furthermore, we downloaded raw data and metadata for a significant proportion of the datasets, including expression profiles annotated with probe IDs, raw RNAsequencing data and raw count data. For microarray data, we utilized the R packages GEOquery (8  and ArrayExpress (9 to download expression profiles from the GEO and ArrayExpress (3 7  databases, respectively. For RNA-Seq data, we primarily downloaded compressed FASTQ files from the European Nucleotide Archive ENA) 10 and manually acquired processed count files from UCSC Xena.  

Customized workflows were adopted for studies using different library construction strategies and are described in our previous studies (11 12 . For microarray data, we utilized limma (v3.52.1) (13  to conduct differential expression analysis. In the case of bulk RNA-Seq data, we employed md5 checking and fastp quality control (v0.23.1) (14  and used HISAT2 (v2.2.1) (15 , featureCounts (v2.0.1) (16 , DESeq2 (v1.36.0) (17  or edgeR (v3.38.1) (18  for read alignment, estimation of gene expression levels and differential expression analysis of samples with or without duplicates, respectively. For scRNA-Seq data, we utilized SCTransform (v0.3.3) (19 , ScType (20  and Seurat (v4.1.1) (21  to construct normalization matrices, annotate cell ypes and perform differential expression analysis, respectively. Default parameters were chosen for all the aforementioned analyses. The source codes and the command line parameters of the software used are provided on the download page of DiSignAtlas (http://www.inbirg.com/disignatlas/download . n each DiSignAtlas dataset, we identified DEGs through differential expression analysis using a significance threshold of adjusted $P$ - value $<0.05$ ; adjusted $P$ values were obtained from the Benjamini − Hochberg (BH) multiple testing correction method implemented in tools including limma, DESeq2 and edgeR (22 . n instances where ${>}1000$ DEGs were identified, to better perform unctional enrichment analysis and signature comparison analysis, we only selected the top 1000 DEGs based on absolute $\log_{2}$ fold change.  

# Enrichment analyses  

Enrichment analysis was performed on the DEGs that met the adjusted $P$ value threshold (23  for each DiSignAtlas dataset using the R package ClusterProfiler 4.0 (24 . The analysis included regulatory transcription factor enrichment from TR

Figure 1. DiSignAtlas workflow. First, disease-related ranscriptomics data were meticulously gathered and curated rom publicly available epositories such as GEO, ArrayExpress and TCGA. These datasets were subsequently organized based on specific diseases and subjected o differential gene expression analysis and downstream unctional enrichment analysis. The esults are stored n a user-friendly database, offering users various options o explore he esults hrough well-structured ables and visually nformative graphs.  

RUST (version 2) (25 , Gene Ontology (GO) term (26  and KEGG pathway (27  enrichment, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). Additionally, we explored distinct cell type markers obtained from the CellMarker (28  and PanglaoDB (29  databases. The source codes can be downloaded on the DiSignAtlas website.  

# Signature comparisons  

Significance was assessed through hypergeometric tests when comparing signatures within the DiSignAtlas dataset and when comparing these signatures to user-submitted gene sets. In cases where lists for both up- and downregulated genes were available, the fold enrichment and $P$ values were averaged to derive the final value. Furthermore, the upregulated gene list in one signature was compared not only to the upregulated gene list in the other signature to test for a positive correlation but also to the downregulated gene list in the other signature to test for a negative correlation. The correlation with the smallest $P$ value was chosen as the ultimate result of the comparison. A significance threshold of $P$ value $<0.05$ was established to determine the significance of enrichment.  

# Web interface implementation  

The database is constructed on a Linux server utilizing Nginx (v1.14.1) as the web server software and uWSGI (v2.0.20) as the application server interface. Metadata and analysis results are stored in the MySQL (v8.0.26) database. Backend data exchange is implemented using Django (v2.1.8), while front-end interactive visualization is achieved through the utilization of Bootstrap (v4.3.1), jQuery (v3.2.1), DataTable (v1.10.21), ECharts (v5.0.2) and Plotly (v2.8.3). Statistical analysis was performed using Python packages such as numpy (v1.21.2), Pandas (v1.3.5), GSEApy (v0.10.8) and SciPy (v1.7.3) (30 .  

# Results  

# Database content and statistics  

The latest DiSignAtlas release comprises an extensive collection of 181 434 bulk and single-cell transcriptome profiles. Within this database, there are $10\ 306$ comparative datasets, including 328 scRNA-Seq/snRNA-Seq datasets, which have been meticulously organized and analysed. These datasets encompass a diverse range of diseases ound n both humans and mice. A grand total of and 1836 distinct disease types were involved. Among these disease types, a staggering 5498991 DEGs associated with various diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, COVID-19 and asthma, were successfully identified. Interactive graphs are provided on the statistics page. For example, 2 of the top 10 DEGs by frequency, i.e. CXCL10 and SPP1 are shown in both human and mouse diseases. The histogram of the number of samples in the disease datasets indicates that most datasets have 5–9 samples. The Venn diagram shows that 261 disease types overlap between humans and mice.  

# Web design and interface  

DiSignAtlas offers a multitude of data retrieval methodologies through its user-friendly web interface (Figure 2 . There are our main data retrieval methods: Quick Search, Advanced Search, Browse and Download (Figure 2A–C). Upon visiting the detailed information page, the user will find a comprehensive overview of the disease dataset along with the analysis results. Furthermore, DiSignAtlas provides users with hree practical analysis ools, namely, differential gene overlap analysis, dataset enrichment analysis and dataset overlap analysis (Figure 2D). The statistics page shows the details of the statistical outcomes derived from the dataset (Figure 2E). Additionally, the download page contains links to all datasets, the original data sources, DEGs, differential gene expression analysis results and gene expression profiles of each dataset, facilitating access to these resources (Figure 2C). Moreover, the source codes of differential gene expression analysis and functional enrichment analysis are provided on the download page as well. DiSignAtlas also warmly invites users to submit new disease data via he submission page Figure 2C). f assistance is needed, the help page provides detailed step-by-step tutorials and contact information. The following section elaborates on some of these functionalities in greater detail.  

# Data searching  

DiSignAtlas features two data searching methods: Quick Search and Advanced Search. These methods allow the efficient retrieval of disease datasets based on user preferences. On the home page, users can use Quick Search methods, including Disease Dataset Search and Differential Gene Search (Figure 2A). By selecting the ‘Search by Disease Dataset’ option, users can input a keyword related to the disease dataset they are interested in, such as the disease name (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease), tissue (e.g. kidney), or data type (e.g. scRNA-Seq). Alternatively, by selecting the ‘Search by Differential Gene’ option, users can enter a gene name or ID and search for disease datasets associated with the submitted gene. Moreover, an Advanced Search option s available on he search page. With this option, users can filter disease datasets according to various features, including ‘gene’, ‘pathogenic factor’, ‘organism’, ‘tissue’, ‘disease name’, ‘disease type’ and ‘data ype’. By applying specific criteria, disease datasets meeting the selected features are listed on the results page.  

# Data browsing  

On the browse page of DiSignAtlas, users have the opportunity to view the available datasets and disease types in an organized manner (Figure 2B). One section presents the whole disease dataset listed in an interactive table, which supports further filtering using options such as disease name, data ype, tissue type and organism. Another visually engaging feature is the disease tree. Two disease trees are provided: one contains all disease types in both humans and mice, and each disease type is annotated to the involved organism(s) in the database; the other contains common disease ypes between humans and mice. These trees provide a comprehensive view of all diseases categorized according to two taxonomies: Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) (31  and Disease Ontology (DO) (32 . Diseases that are not present in either of these two databases are grouped under the category ‘Other Diseases’. This classification system helps users quickly locate diseases of interest within different taxonomic hierarchies. Additionally, the home page features a disease cloud, which visually represents the distribution and prominence of different diseases in the DiSignAtlas database. The size of each disease name in the cloud is proportional to its representation in the datasets, offering a quick glimpse of the representation of different diseases in the platform.  

# Detailed information  

When a user clicks on a DiSignAtlas ID on the Results or browse page, they are redirected to the corresponding dataset’s details page (Figure 3 . This details page provides comprehensive information related to the disease dataset, including various key elements. Under the Disease Information section, users can find essential details about the disease, such as its name, definition, involved tissue types, relevant references and external inks o other databases such as DO Exper imental Factor Ontology (EFO), Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), Monarch Disease Ontology (MONDO), MeSH, Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO), Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and National Cancer Institute (NCI) (31–38  (Figure 3A). The Differential Genes section presents a list of DEGs identified as associated with a given disease. These DEGs are illustrated through boxplots in the table. Additionally, volcano plots and heatmaps are provided to visually represent the differential gene expression patterns. Users can also explore differential cell type markers associated with the disease. For further insight into disease-related functions and pathways, he details page ncludes nformation about the enrichment of upstream transcription factors and downstream unctions/pathways. This enhances he user’s understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease. In the case of diseases with correlated features, DiSignAtlas offers overlap analysis using the hypergeometric test, which provides information about diseases with positively or negatively correlated characteristics Figure 3A, B). Moreover, the details page provides tools for single-cell clustering analyses (Figure 4 . Users can explore cell cluster maps, cell ratios, cluster marker genes and DEGs in clusters at different resolutions and with different types of visualizations (t-SNE or UMAP) (Figure 4A, B). If available, cell types can also be inferred from the analysis. The cell ratio plot visually displays the proportion of cells in each cluster for the disease and control groups, providing valuable insights into cell population changes.  

# Analytical functions  

DiSignAtlas offers three practical analysis functions: differential gene overlap analysis, dataset enrichment analysis and dataset overlap analysis. These tools empower users to compare their genetic signatures with those in the DiSignAtlas datasets or perform comparisons between retrieved DiSignAtlas datasets (Figure 2 .  

Differential gene overlap analysis allows users to discover disease datasets in DiSignAtlas whose DEGs significantly overlap with a user-submitted gene set. Users can input a list of DEGs, specifying whether they are up- or downregulated. The analysis then maps these genes to relevant datasets from the same organism (human or mouse) and performs hypergeometric tests to identify datasets with significant enrichment. The eligible datasets are sorted by $P$ value, enabling users to identify the most significantly relevant disease datasets. Additionally, significant enrichment in datasets from another organism can be obtained by transforming the submitted gene list to orthologous genes and then mapping them to the relevant studies. Moreover, clicking on the dataset ID brings up a new page containing the Results table, a Venn diagram and a display of overlapping genes between two traits.

B Clicking on he Analysis’ button eads o a page hat comprehensively llustrates he overlapping DEGs and unctional enrichment esults.  

Dataset enrichment analysis helps to identify disease datasets in DiSignAtlas that are overrepresented in a usersubmitted gene set. Users furnish a set of genes, and the analysis proceeds to execute the GSEA algorithm across all DiSignAtlas datasets or he specified organism. Additionally, t considers homologous genes present in datasets from another organism. The enriched datasets are returned and sorted by enrichment score, allowing users to identify datasets with high relevance to the submitted gene set.  

Dataset overlap analysis enables users to perform comparisons between different datasets in DiSignAtlas. When multiple related datasets are found, the dataset overlap analysis is displayed on the results page or in the ‘Diseases with correlated signatures’ section of the details page. The analysis displays overlapping downstream DEGs of diseases in a network format, helping users identify shared genetic features. Additionally, the GO terms or KEGG pathways associated with DEGs according to functional enrichment analysis are listed, providing insights into the biological functions and processes implicated in the disease datasets.

# Case study  

To demonstrate the application of DiSignAtlas, we investigated influenza, commonly known as ‘the flu’, as an example. Influenza is an infectious disease caused by influenza viruses that infect the nose, throat and sometimes the lungs. Using the advanced search, we can search ‘influenza’ in the disease form and ‘Homo sapiens’ in the organism form to yield 118 influenza-related datasets (Supplementary Table S1). Clicking the ‘overlapping analysis’ button at the bottom of the results page shows the common DEGs of those datasets. Eighteen genes in at least eight datasets were dysregulated (Supplementary Table S2). Among those genes, IFI27 IFI35 IFI44L IFIT1 IFIT3 and IFITM3 belong to the interferon alpha gene family. All of hem have been dentified as promising biomarkers and/or therapeutic targets for influenza infection (39–42 . Then, we further examined one of the datasets, ‘DSA08144’. The detailed information page shows that ‘viral process’ was enriched in the functional analysis of DEGs in influenza. In the section ‘Diseases with correlated signatures’, 9 and 2 of the top 10 human and mouse disease datasets sorted by enrichment score are influenza-related datasets with positively correlated signatures, respectively (Supplementary Table S3). This ndicates hat mice with nfluenza share similar signatures with humans and can therefore be used as disease models for studies of human influenza. The search results indicate that DiSignAtlas could help to explore the diagnosis, mechanism and models of human diseases.  

# Conclusions and future directions  

Molecular signatures, ncluding genetic variants, proteins and metabolites, play a crucial role in biomedical research. These signatures can be employed in various domains, such as disease diagnosis, prognosis, disease progression and personalized medicine. Identifying the genetic signatures associated with disease perturbations is essential for studying gene functions, biological processes and mechanisms of diseases. While numerous studies report disease–gene associations, comparing the associations systematically is often challenging due to differences in methods employed and the frequent focus on individual genes. Omics-derived signatures can address this challenge effectively. Over the years, a substantial amount of transcriptomic data have been generated from various disease contexts in humans and mice. However, these data are often disorganized and scattered, hindering knowledge mining. In contrast, the data in DiSignAtlas have been meticulously gathered and processed using standardized methodologies, ensuring that they can be readily compared and analysed, with $10306$ organized datasets in the current version. DiSignAtlas offers the ability to examine alterations caused by disease perturbations at multiple levels, ncluding the gene, pathway and cell type levels. DiSignAtlas stands out with three novel features. First, it possesses the largest number of datasets of any database of its kind, not only for cancer but also for various types of diseases in both humans and mice. Second, signatures derived from transcriptomic data enable comparisons between diseases or even between human and mouse diseases. Third, DiSignAtlas includes 328 scRNA-Seq datasets, allowing single-cell analysis to be performed. We plan to regularly update DiSignAtlas every 3 months with newly released data, and we further intend to incorporate other omics data, such as genomics and proteomics data, in the future. Additionally, future versions will nclude data rom diseases n other organisms. We will also develop and incorporate additional analytical ools nto DiSignAtlas o compare and ntegrate additional aspects of the disease datasets.  

In summary, DiSignAtlas serves as a comprehensive resource for transcriptomics-based signatures related to various diseases. It not only provides links between diseases and DEGs, pathways and cell types but also enables comparisons among diseases and organisms. As the most comprehensive database of omics-based disease signatures currently available, DiSignAtlas is expected to facilitate the exploration of diagnostic markers, disease models, mechanisms of action and treatment approaches for various diseases. DiSignAtlas is expected o be an nvaluable resource or bioscientists and bioinformaticians conducting translational research.

# Introduction  

Multiple types of mutations such as single nucleotide variations (SNVs), gene fusions, alternative splicing and copy number variations (CNVs) are common in tumors. These mutations play important roles in tumor occurrence and progression, and compose the intra-tumor and inter-tumor heterogeneity, often leading to different immune microenvironments (1–3 . Studying hese mutation ypes and heir cellular context is of great significance or nvestigating he key mechanisms of tumorigenesis and selecting treatment plans accordingly.  

The emerging huge amount of single-cell transcriptomic data and atlas projects comprehensively characterize diverse cell types and states in various normal and tumor tissues (4– 6 . Calling mutations from single-cell transcriptomic data can link genetics to cellular molecular traits in large-scale data without the need for complex and nonuniform experimental protocols for joint profiling of the DNA and RNA from the same cell. Recent computational methods such as scFusion 7 , Cellsnp-lite (8 , SComatic (9 , SCmut (10 , Monopogen (11 , scReadCounts (12 , BRIE (13  and STmut (14 , have verified the reliability of detecting multiple types of mutations from single-cell transcriptomic data. Biological research has also demonstrated the biological significance. Du et al  detected the subcluster of leukemic blasts with both NUP98/NSD1 and RUNX1/ZNF423 fusion (15 . Muñoz et al  revealed splicing variations among some single macrophages leading to different functions (16 . Single-cell-level SNV profiles from single-cell transcriptomic data demonstrated their significance in distinguishing tumor cell subpopulations, characterizing tumor cell phenotypes, and lineage tracing $17-$ 19 . The combined analysis of mutations and gene expression on individual cells has yielded many biological discoveries (7 20–23 .  

Establishing a single-cell mutation landscape can provide a critical resource for studying the association between mutations and heir gene expression profiles, and or elucidating he mechanisms of umorigenesis and evolution. However, here s a lack of a single-cell-level database that contains comprehensive mutation nformation. Existing databases such as scQTLbase (24  and CancerSCEM (25  only provide bulk-level mutation information with single-cell gene expression profiles, which imits our understanding of mutations n heterogeneous cell populations and how mutations shape cell phenotypes.  

Therefore, we built scTML (http://sctml.xglab.tech/ , the first comprehensive pan-cancer single-cell mutational landscape database. From around $80\mathrm{T}$ raw sequencing data, we called multiple types of mutations at the single-cell level, including SNVs, insertions/deletions, gene fusions, alternative splicing and CNVs, along with gene expression, cell states and other phenotype information. The data are from 74 datasets with 2 582 633 cells, including datasets from fulllength (Smart-seq2), 10X and spatial transcriptomic technology. We collected all publicly available single-cell full-length transcriptomic data with raw sequencing reads and established the analysis framework in scTML primarily based on full-length transcriptomic data, considering their significantly higher coverage and mutation detection rates. Additionally, we provide he mutation profiles of 10X and spatial ranscriptomic data to better utilize their larger data volumes to establish a more comprehensive mutational landscape. Besides the rich information and valuable resources in scTML, we also enable users online exploring the landscapes of multiple mutations across tumors or cell types, analyzing single-cell-level mutation-phenotype relationships and detecting cell subclusters of interest.

This article collects tumor full-length single-cell transcriptomic data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (26 , Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (27 , European Nucleic Archive (ENA) (28  and Genome Sequence Archive (GSA) (29 . The search keywords are combinations of ‘scRNA-seq’, ‘singlecell’, transcriptomics’, Smart-seq2’, full-length’, tumor’ and ‘cancer’. After obtaining the candidate dataset list, we manually read the metadata of each dataset to ensure that it meets the following conditions: (i) it is tumor single-cell transcriptomic data based on full-length sequencing technologies such as Smart-seq2; (ii) original sequencing reads can be obtained; (iii) the number of original cells in the dataset should not be ${<}100$ . Finally, a total of 35 eligible full-length datasets were obtained (Supplementary Table S1 . We collected the public $10\mathrm{X}$ and spatial transcriptomic data according to atlas research and databases (30–32 . We required that the raw sequencing reads can be obtained. We finally collected 23 datasets from the 10X technology and 16 spatial transcriptomic datasets (Supplementary Table S1 .  

We downloaded the raw sequencing reads (fastq or bam files) of these data. We also manually read metadata to label the tumor type, tumor source, and whether the tumor is primary or metastatic. Tumor sources are divided into four categories, including tissue, cell line, patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs).  

# Gene expression quantification and data quality control  

Based on obtained the raw sequencing reads, we quantified gene expression. Firstly, based on STAR (33 , we align fulllength transcriptomic sequencing reads to the hg19 human reference genome to obtain the genomic coordinates of the sequencing reads. Then, based on human gene annotation (GENCODE19 (34 ), the featureCounts (35  algorithm was used to count the number of sequencing reads for each gene region, and transcripts per million (TPM) was calculated. Finally, gene expression was quantified as log2 $\left(\mathrm{TPM}+1\right)$ ). For 10X single-cell and spatial ranscriptomic datasets, we applied CellRanger and SpaceRanger or quantifying gene expression. Then, we conduct quality control on each dataset, retaining only cells that meet the following conditions: (i) the number of uniquely mapped reads is not ${<}1\times10^{4}$ ii) he proportion of reads uniquely mapped on mitochondrial genes is ${<}30\%$ ; (3) the number of expressed genes is ${>}200$ . For each dataset, only genes expressed in no $^{<3}$ cells are retained.  

# SNV detection and gene fusion calling  

After sequence alignment of single-cell full-length transcriptome sequencing reads, this study uses GATK (36  to detect SNVs rom he aligned data. The mutation reference data used (dbSNP138 37 and 1000G phase 1 38 ) were obtained rom the official GATK website. Considering the calling speed and quality, we used cellsnp-lite 8 mode 1a n 10X single-cell and spatial transcriptomic datasets. We annotated SNVs based on ANNOVAR (39  and mainly included SNVs causing amino acid changes n he analysis ramework. We used STAR-Fusion (40  to detect gene fusion events from raw sequencing reads.  

# Quality control for SNV and gene fusion calling  

For SNV, we followed the GATK pipeline and removed mutations with QualByDepth (QD) $<2.0$ or FisherStrand (FS) ${>}30.0$ . QD is the variant confidence divided by the unfiltered depth of non-hom-ref samples. According to the GATK documentation, for filtering purposes, QD is better than either variant confidence or depth directly. FS is the Phred-scaled probability that there is strand bias at the site. An FS value close to 0 means nearly no strand bias (whether the alternate allele was seen often on the forward or reverse strand) at the site. Also, we only kept SNVs with records in dbSNP (37  and having a rsID, to make the SNVs included in scTML reliable SNVs verified before.  

For gene fusion, we only retained gene fusion events with a fusion fragment count no $<0.1$ per million sequencing reads.  

# Alternative splicing quantification  

We used BRIE (13  to quantify the percentage spliced in (PSI) of variable splicing exons based on aligned sequencing reads. BRIE is a variable splicing quantification algorithm based on Bayesian models combining prior knowledge related to variable splicing with single-cell observations. A larger PSI means a higher proportion of the exon retained in the transcript.  

# Cell type annotation  

We comprehensively annotated the cells in each dataset using metadata information and marker genes. According to the tumor type, we determined potential cell types (e.g. hepatocytes cannot appear n central nervous system umors). f some datasets are from tumor cell lines, he cell type can be directly limited to tumor cells.  

Then, we performed high variable gene detection, principal component analysis, and clustering based on the Leiden algorithm (setting resolution as 1.0). All calculations are based on the default parameters of Scanpy (41 .  

We collected and organized marker genes from literature (25 42 43  (Supplementary Table S2 . Considering the characteristics of Smart-seq2 datasets, and the consistency among various cancer types and data types, we designed the following cell type annotation strategy according to previous Smartseq2 research such as Karaayvaz et al. and Li et al  (44 45 , and manually checked he annotation results based on he provided annotation results of some data.  

For a certain cell cluster C  it is assumed that there are $k$ possible cell types. We defined the cell-type possibility score of this cell cluster as $s_{1}$ $s_{2}$ · · · , $s_{k}$ The possibility score $s_{i}$ of cell type $i$ represents the number of cells in this cluster that express cell ype $i$ marker genes Supplementary Table S2 . The possibility score $s_{i}$ for cell type $i$ is defined as:  

$$
s_{i}=\sum_{c\in C}T_{i}\left(c\right)
$$  

where $c$ represents the cells in cell cluster C  and $T_{i}(c)$ represents whether the cell expresses the marker gene for cell type $i.$ For cell $c$ , f the average expression level of marker genes for cell type $i$ is ${>}1$ , then $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{i}}(\mathrm{c})=1$ . Otherwise, $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{i}}(c)=0$ . After obtaining the $k$ cell-type possibility scores of this cell cluster, we defined the cell type with the highest score as the cell type of the cluster.  

CNV quantification and malignant cell identification We identified the malignant-cell candidate cell type according to the tumor type. For example, in colorectal cancer, lung cancer and other solid tumors, the malignant-cell candidate cell type is epithelial cells. For glioma, the candidate cell type is astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. For multiple myeloma, the candidate cell type is plasma cells.  

We used InferCNVpy (46  to calculate the CNV value by comparing the sum of all gene expression levels in a genomic region between the target cell and the reference cell. There are 4866 genomic regions and corresponding 4866 CNV values for each cell. We set immunocytes or stroma cells as the reference cells, and calculated the CNV matrix and final CNV score using InferCNVpy for each cell of malignant-cell candidate cell type. We cannot calculate CNV scores in datasets without any immunocytes or stroma cells.  

Then, we used InferCNVpy to cluster cells based on the CNV matrix and labeled cell clusters with significantly higher average CNV scores than reference cell types as malignant cells.  

# Cell state quantification  

Based on MSigDB (47  and Gene Ontology (48 , CancerSEA (42  provided 14 cell states of tumor cells, including angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell cycle, differentiation, DNA damage, DNA repair, epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), hypoxia, inflammation, invasion, metastasis, proliferation and quiescence. We collected signature genes for each cell state from CancerSEA and used GSVA 49  o calculate he cell state scores for malignant cells.  

# Statistical analyses  

The differential analysis for cross-dataset association is based on the ‘rank_genes_groups’ function (Wilcoxon) with default parameters in Scanpy (v1.9.6) (41 . Other analyses are based on Pandas (v1.3.5), Numpy (v1.22.4) and Scipy (v1.11.4).  

# Database construction  

The online database framework deployed on NGINX and Gunicorn (v22.0.0) in an Ubuntu environment. Some results are generated instantly when users query and transmit using Fastapi (v0.111.0) and Uvicorn $(\mathrm{v}0.29.0)$ . Front-end packages such as jQuery (v3.4.1), echarts (v5.5.0), zingchart (v2.8.9) and select2 (v4.1.0) were utilized for the visualization of results.  

# Results  

# Overview of scTML  

scTML offers a pan-cancer single-cell landscape of multiple mutation ypes or nvestigating single-cell-level mutation patterns and exploring mutation-phenotype associations. We collected 74 single-cell transcriptomic datasets with 2 582 633 cells n otal, covering 24 umor ypes. We collected all 35 ulllength datasets with publicly available raw sequencing files, 23 datasets from $10\mathrm{X}$ technology and 16 spatial datasets. We integrated existing mapping and mutation-calling methods, forming a unified computational framework and calling mutations from around $80\mathrm{T}$ raw sequencing data (Figure 1A and B). scTML includes 636 251 SNVs and insertions/deletions, $98\ 632\$ gene fusions, 5784 alternative splicing and 4866

Figure 1. Overview of scTML. A The procedure of data collection and pre-processing  B The data composition of scTML. C The mutation ypes included n scTML. D The analysis ramework of scTML. The mutation ypes can be classified nto wo categories: discrete SNVs and gene usions and continuous alternative splicing and CNVs). Profiling’ and Association’ correspond o wo web pages, espectively.  

CNVs, along with $55~407$ gene expression, 14 cell states and other phenotype information (Figure 1C).  

Based on these resources, we designed the analysis framework from four aspects: ‘cross-dataset profiling’, ‘per-dataset profiling’, ‘cross-dataset association’ and ‘per-dataset association’. Our analysis framework is primarily based on fulllength transcriptomic data, considering their significantly higher coverage and mutation detection rates. The mutation types can be classified into two categories: discrete (represented by the presence or absence in a cell, including SNVs and gene fusions) and continuous (represented by a score in a cell, including alternative splicing and CNVs) (Figure 1D). For cross-dataset profiling, we calculated the percentage of cells with the selected discrete mutation in each tumor type and cell type, and for continuous mutations, we visualized the distribution of mutation scores by arranging their scores in order and compared the distribution among datasets. For per-dataset profiling, we calculated UMAP projection based on gene expression in each dataset, and then plotted the selected mutation on the UMAP. For cross-dataset association, we calculated the gene differential expression analysis between the cells with and without the selected discrete mutation in each dataset, and calculated the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC) for continuous mutations. Using bubble plots, we represented he association direction n dot color (signed logarithmic adjusted $P$ value or the sign of PCCs) and represented the degree of association in dot size (the absolute value of logarithmic fold change or PCCs). As for the per-dataset association, we plotted the association in the selected dataset using violin plots for discrete mutations and scatter plots with he regression ine or continuous mutations (Figure 1D).  

We then displayed results from the analysis framework on three web pages: ‘Mutation profile’, ‘Association’ and ‘Compare’. The first page mainly includes cross-dataset and perdataset profiling. The second page mainly includes crossdataset and per-dataset associations. In the ‘Compare’ page, we put the profiles of different mutation types from the same dataset together and provided a dataset-centric presentation, considering that the first two pages both selected a mutation first.  

# Explore the cross-dataset and per-dataset mutation profiles  

On the ‘Mutation profile’ page, users can explore the crossdataset and per-dataset mutation profiles. This page provides three modules: ‘Mutation profile summary’, ‘Selecting one mutation for viewing the cross-data profiling’ and ‘Viewing mutation in one dataset’.  

As he first step, users need o select a mutation ype among four types (Figure 2A). Then, users can view the mutation summary heatmap, which shows the top 20 SNVs (or fusions) with the highest average cell proportion in each tumor type (Figure 2B). For alternative splicing (or CNVs), the heatmap shows the average standard deviation of Psi values for each alternative splicing ranscript or amplification evels or chromosome segments).  

As the second step, aking the mutation type SNV as an example, users can select a mutation gene, and then select an amino acid change. Then, the cross-data profiling plot can show the cell percentage of this mutation in each dataset, tumor type and cell type (Figure 2C). When selecting alternative splicing or CNVs, the cross-data profiling plot shows the heatmap of the continuous mutation distributions in each dataset (the $x$ axis is the sorted scores, and the tumor types are labeled on the right side).  

As the third step, users can select a tumor type and a dataset of interest. Users can explore the dataset by viewing the dataset metadata able or selecting a metadata column and then viewing the corresponding UMAP plot (Figure 2D). The metadata that can be plotted mainly includes cell type annotation, donors, groups assigned by the biological experiment and source tissue, cell ines, PDX or CTCs). Also, after selecting a mutation type and selecting a specific mutation, users can view the per-data profiling UMAP plot (Figure 2E).  

# Explore the mutation-phenotype associations in the single-cell level  

On the ‘Association’ page, users can explore the mutationphenotype associations at the single-cell level. After selecting the mutation of interest (Figure 3A), the cross-dataset association bubble plot shows the differential analysis results on gene expressions or cell state profiles, regarding cells with the selected mutation as one cluster, and cells without the mutation as the other (Figure 3B). The bubble plot shows the top 15 genes with the highest differential analysis significance for each dataset. In the bubble plot, color means direction and dot size means the degree of difference. Also, we require that in the dataset included in the bubble plot, here are at least 10 cells with mutations and at least 10 cells without mutations. For continuous mutations alternative splicing and CNVs), he plot shows PCCs with gene expressions or cell states.  

Users can manually select a dataset of interest (Figure 3A), or click the dataset name on the $x$ axis of the bubble plot, and this dataset will be automatically selected. Then users can explore the association in this dataset. Also, clicking the gene name or cell state name on the y-axis can lead to the gene being automatically selected (Figure 3A and B). After selecting a specific dataset and gene (or cell state), users can further observe the association between the mutation selected earlier and the gene in the dataset, through the gene UMAP plot, he violin plot (or scatter plot for continuous mutations) (Figure 3C).  

# Compare and download the landscapes of multiple mutation profiles  

The Compare’ page provides a dataset-centric comprehensive presentation and comparison of multiple mutation and phenotype profiles n he selected dataset, considering he first wo pages (the ‘Mutation profile’ and ‘Association’ page) both selected a mutation first. Users first select the data type from Smart-seq2 (full-length sequencing), 10X and spatial transcriptomics, then select a specific dataset and view the biological information. Then users can select a specific gene or cell state, and select specific mutations in SNV, fusion, alternative splicing or CNV profiles or viewing and comparing he UMAP plot (Figure 2D). For spatial transcriptomics, scTML provides he issue mages and displays mutation or phenotype information at the corresponding positions of the tissue. This page can be used o compare he biological nformation, genotype and phenotype UMAP plot, and find the cell subcluster of interest.  

On the ‘Download’ page, users can use the data selector to select he umor ype, dataset and specific profile o download. When finding the mutation of interest in the ‘Mutation profile’, users can also jump to the ‘Download’ page by clicking a button and download the corresponding data for custom analysis.  

# Usage example  

The BRAF V600E SNV is an important driver mutation and therapeutic target. Taking BRAF V600E as an example, we found that in chronic myeloid leukemia, $22\%$ of cells have BRAF V600E mutation (Figure 2C), which is consistent with previous research (50 . In the cross-dataset association, we found a negative association between BRAF V600E and the NCAM1 gene. NCAM1 tends to have a higher expression level in cells without BRAF V600E. n the GSE76312 dataset, we further observed that NCAM1 is mainly expressed in the upper part of the UMAP plot, while the BRAF V600E is mainly detected in the UMAP lower part (Figure 3C and D). NCAM1 (CD56) is found with a link to tumor progression (51 52 , can promote leukemogenesis and confer drug resistance in leukemia (53 . In the ‘Compare’ page, we also found that mutually exclusive with BRAF V600E, BCR-ABL1 fusion events are mainly detected in the UMAP upper part, and those cells have stronger invasiveness (Figure 3D). Considering the RAS/MAPK pathway (54 55  and BCR-ABL1 fusion (56  both play important roles in chronic myeloid leukemia, and BRAF is a key factor of the RAS/MAPK pathway (57 , our findings indicate the diverse patterns of clonal selection and mutual exclusion of driver mutations in chronic myeloid leukemia.

# Discussion and future directions  

We have developed a database scTML by systematically curating published datasets and establishing a comprehensive analyzing framework. scTML includes SNVs, insertions/deletions, gene fusions, alternative splicing and CNVs, along with gene expression, cell states, and other phenotype information from 74 datasets with 2 582 633 cells in total. Providing single-cell datasets with cell-matched multiple mutation types, scTML can also enable researchers online exploring these valuable resources from multiple aspects including cross-dataset and per-dataset profiling, and cross-dataset and per-dataset association.  

The three data types of scTML include full-length singlecell transcriptomes with deep sequencing and rich mutation information, as well as 10X single-cell transcriptomics with a large number of cells and cell types, and spatial transcriptomes that provide spatial and tissue slice information. In full-length datasets, we detected 1578.2 mutations per cell on average, while in $10\mathrm{X}$ and spatial transcriptomic datasets, 0.6 and 0.8 mutations were detected per cell, respectively (Supplementary Figure S1A). As for CNVs, due to the fulllength transcriptomics covering more genes, greater variations of CNV scores were also observed among full-length datasets (Supplementary Figure S1B). The average variation of CNV scores is 17.8 in full-length datasets, and the average variations are 0.1 and 1.1 in 10X and spatial transcriptomic datasets, respectively.  

Wide researchers can be benefited from scTML. Researchers who focus on certain mutations can apply scTML to investigate the distribution of these mutations in different tumors and cell types, study genes and cell states associated with these mutations, and explore whether these mutations are enriched in a specific subcluster of cells (58 59 . Oncology researchers can also use scTML to systematically explore how various mutations and molecular mechanisms work together during tumor occurrence and progression, and form inter-tumor and intra-tumor heterogeneity (60 61 . The processed data of scTML can also be downloaded and used for the development of new algorithms or computational frameworks. Some high-level analyzing approaches based on mutations can be extended to the single-cell level and bring new discoveries (62–66 .  

In the future, we will continue to improve and expand scTML. In the current version of scTML, we have collected all full-length datasets with publicly available raw sequencing files, but we have also found that there are some high-quality datasets without publicly available raw sequencing data. In the future, we will strive to contact relevant authors to obtain the raw sequencing data of these datasets. In addition, there are currently more single-cell sequencing technologies with the ability to identify mutations, such as G&T-seq (67 and DR-seq (68 . Although the quality and analysis methods of hese data are not consistent, ncluding hem can urther expand our database. n summary, scTML is a valuable resource that provides pan-cancer single-cell mutation landscapes, aiding in the deciphering of heterogeneous cell populations and how mutations shape cell phenotypes.

# Introduction  

Animal microbiomes play important roles in their hosts (1 2 , and many factors influence the composition and function of animal microbiota, such as the environment (3 , diet (4 5 , disease states (6 7  and genetic background of the host (8 . As a result, the roles played by animal microbiota in biodiversity have become a focus of interest for researchers. The diversity of animal microbiota represents a vast genetic resource hat could be exploited or he discovery of novel genes, biomolecules for metabolic pathways and potentially valuable end-products (9 . With the rapid development of highthroughput sequencing technology, the availability of animal metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metaproteomic data in public repositories has substantially increased. Databases such as the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA), the EBI European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), and the Proteomics Identification Database (PRIDE) contain a wealth of animal metaomics data (10–12 . The study of animal meta-omics can be used to reveal the links between specific microbial species and microbial coding capacity with important animal production traits, monitor inflammatory biomarkers during diseases, explore the different functional activities of individual genes in species or microbiota, and identify the interactions and actual functional characteristics of the most active components of the microbiota (13–18 .  

To explore he relationship between microbiota and habitat characteristics, and to display important functional genes in microbial genomes, several related databases have been constructed and published. For example, proGenomes3 provides nearly one million high-quality genomes with consistent taxonomic, functional, and habitat annotations (19 . The Integrated Microbial Genomes $\&$ Microbiomes (IMG/M) system provides the comparative analysis and annotation of microbial genome, metagenome, and metatranscriptome datasets (20 . ProPan provides information on the pan-genome composition and functional annotations of 1504 species (21 . However, these databases mainly contain processed data collected from diverse habitats, making it challenging to establish the relationship between animal microbiota and hosts. Some databases contain metagenomic data from various animal hosts. For example, the AnimalMetagenome DB provides animal metagenomic metadata (22 , the Animal Microbiome Database (AMDB) provides the taxonomic profiles of gut microbiota in various animal species (23 , and a database for composition and roles of animal microbiome (CRAMdb) provides data on the correlations between microorganisms and host phenotypes (24 . However, these databases do not include microbial genome data, metatranscriptomic data, or metaproteomic data, so they cannot provide information on the composition and gene function of active microorganisms (Table 1 . Therefore, there is a need for an integrated database that contains animal microbiome data from multiple meta-omics levels, including metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metaproteomics, to better understand the functional potential and activities of he microbiota nhabiting animal hosts.  

In this study, a comprehensive multi-omics database was established that integrates, analyzes, and annotates metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metaproteomic data from various non-human animal species. A total of 55898 microbial genomes were annotated from 581 animal species across 578 projects, including 42 924 bacterial genomes, 12336 virus genomes, 496 archaea genomes and 142 fungi genomes. The database contains more than 110 million gene functional information, including a comprehensive set of protein functional annotations, KEGG pathway analysis, carbohydrate active enzymes and antibiotic resistance gene annotations. Moreover, this work analyzed 321 metatranscriptomic datasets rom 31 animal species and 326 metaproteomic datasets from four animal species, as well as the pan-genomic dynamics and compositional characteristics of 679 bacterial species and 13 archaea species from animal hosts.  

# Materials and methods  

# Data collection and processing  

The Animal Meta-omics landscape database (AnimalMetaOmics) construction scheme is shown in Figure 1 Firstly, microbial genomes, metagenomic data, metatranscriptomic data, metaproteomic data, and associated metadata were manually collected from animal hosts from the NCBI Nucleotide, NCBI SRA and PRIDE databases, including raw sequencing reads, genome sequences, assembly information, sample information, and publication information. Then the sample information was matched with the corresponding genome and sequencing information based on the sample accession number.  

# Metagenome analysis  

The metagenomic sequencing data of 148 samples from 10 different animals were downloaded from NCBI SRA database (Supplementary Table S1). For the analysis of metagenomic data, we referred to the EasyMetagenome project (https: //github.com/YongxinLiu/EasyMetagenome . To ensure the quality of the genome assembly results, Readfq (v.8.0) was used to preprocess the raw data of each sample to obtain clean reads. The filtering criteria were as follows: (i) lowquality reads were removed, and reads with base content ${>}40\%$ and mass value ${>}20$ were retained; and (ii) reads containing more than $10\%$ of $N$ bases were filtered out. The clean reads were assembled using MEGAHIT (v.1.2.9), the minimum length of contig was set to 300 bp. MetaWRAP (v0.7) was used to integrate and analyze the assembly sequence (25 26 . Incomplete genomes were filtered based on quality using CheckM (v.1.2.2), and the genomes with sequence lengths ${>}300$ bp, completeness $550\%$ , and contamination ${<}10\%$ were retained (27 . The processed data were aligned against the NR (non-redundant) database using Diamond (v.2.0.7) to obtain species annotations for the corresponding genomes. The combination of four viral characteristics were used to identify viral metagenomic clusters: (i) Species annotations were categorized as phages or virus; (ii) genomic sequences did not contain 16S or 18S sequences; (iii) sequences with a linear genome type exceed $5\mathrm{k}$ in size, while circular genome types exceed $1.5\mathrm{k}$ n size; iv) at east $50\%$ of the genes in the genome were annotated as genes belonging to phage or viral species when aligned against the NR database (28 . Finally, gene prediction and functional annotation were performed for each microbial genome.  

Prodigal (v.2.6.3) was used to predict the gene sequences in microbial genomes lacking annotation information (29 . Eggnog-mapper software (v.2.1.8) was used to annotate the coding genes by mapping them to the eggNOG database (30 31 . This database provided a comprehensive annotation framework that included various protein functional categories. By assigning protein sequences to orthologous groups, functional annotations were obtained for the proteins and indirect annotations for KEGG pathways (32 33 . The dbCAN2 HMM models 34 were used o annotate carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) (35 . Then Diamond software (v.2.0.7) was used to align the protein sequences of the coding genes to the

CARD database to annotate the antibiotic resistance genes, and he resistance mechanism of each drug resistance gene and the antibiotic resistant category were evaluated according to the mapped antibiotic resistance ontology ARO) 36 37 . The annotation results retained the most optimal results of each coding gene.  

# Metatranscriptome analysis  

To ensure the quality of the metatranscriptomic data, damaged data and data in which all reads belong to ribosomal RNA have been removed. The SAMSA2 pipeline was used to analyze the metatranscriptomic data with default parameters. (Supplementary Table S2). The specific methods are as follows: (i) PEAR software (v.0.9.8) was used to merge two paired-end reads; ii) rimmomatic software v.0.40) was used to remove low-quality sequences and adaptor contamination; (iii) SortMeRNA software (v.2.1) was used to remove ribosome sequences; (iv) using Diamond software (v.2.0.7) to annotate the data against the NCBI RefSeq database; (v) Python script was used to convert the DIAMOND output into a sorted abundance count, generating two files—one file contained organism annotations, while the other file contained functional annotations of the same reads; (vi) R script was used to analyze the data, calculate the difference expression and generate tables and graphs (38 39 .  

# Metaproteome analysis  

MetaProteomeAnalyzer Portable (v.2.0.0) was used to process all the metaproteomic data (Supplementary Table S3) (40 . The raw data were independently searched against the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot databases (released April 2023) for bacteria (UniProt ID 2, 335 807 entries), archaea (UniProt ID 2157, 19 701 entries) and viruses (UniProt ID 10239, 17 304 entries). The software parameters were set as ollows: he parent ion tolerance was set at $4.5\ \mathrm{ppm}$ , the fragment ion tolerance was set at $0.5~\mathrm{Da}$ , and other software parameters were kept as default.  

# Pan-genome analysis  

FastANI (v.1.33) was used to calculate the average nucleotide identity (ANI) among strains, and the strains with an ANI ${\geq}0.95$ were retained for further analysis (41 . The dataset used or analysis consisted of species with five or more strains. Roary (v.3.13.0) was used to analyze the composition and function of the pan-genome with default parameters (42 .  

# Web implementation  

AnimalMetaOmics was constructed based on the ThinkPHP (v.5.0.24) framework, using Vue.js (v.2.7.14) (https: //vuejs.org/  as the JavaScript library. D3.js (https://d3js.org/ , Echarts.js (https://echarts.apache.org/zh/ ndex.html , and Highcharts.js (https://www.highcharts.com/  are used as tools in AnimalMetaOmics to provide high quality interactive data visualization. AnimalMetaOmics runs on the Apache 2 web server (v.2.4.53) with MySQL (v.8.0.29) as its database engine. AnimalMetaOmics is available online without registration and is optimized for Chrome (recommended), Opera, Firefox, Windows Edge, and macOS Safari.  

# Database content and usage  

# Overview of AnimalMetaOmics  

AnimalMetaOmics is a multi-omics landscape database for the study of animal microbial genomes and microbiomes, including four modules: the metagenome, metatranscriptome, metaproteome and pan-genome (Figure 1 . These modules provide abundant and convenient visualization tools for users to browse, search and analyze various aspects of the microbiome, such as gene function, genome maps, pan-genome composition, active microbial composition and expressed protein sequences. By employing these modules, researchers can better explore he classification and unctional diversity of animal microbiota.

# Metagenome  

The metagenome module includes a total of 55898 microbial genomes from 581 species of animals, of which bacteria are the most abundant, accounting for $76.79\%$ (42924) of the total microbial genomes, followed by viruses, archaea, and fungi, which account for $22.07\%$ (12336), $0.89\%$ (496) and $0.25\%$ (142) respectively (Supplementary Figure S1). Users can compare microbial genomes and genes across hosts, across sample sites or across microbial species by searching for specific host, microorganism or gene name. Moreover, users can browse the genome information through the metadata table, browse the general situation of all genes and the functions of specific genes intuitively through the genome map, and obtain the statistics of Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) category and carbohydrate enzyme classification through the function annotation module.  

Case study 1: Exploring the genome composition and gene function of ntestinal bacteria n Sus scrofa Entering he word ‘Sus scrofa  into the global search box, there are 5411 bacterial genomes, 30 archaea genomes and 489 virus genomes associated with Sus scrofa in the metagenome module of AnimalMetaOmics (Figure 2A). There are 381 bacterial species from the intestines, among which Campylobacter coli has the largest number of genomes, comprising 1017 (including 1014 isolated genomes) (Figure 2B). Taking the genome of Akkermansia muciniphila (GCA_022769425.1) as an example, it was found to contain 2181 predicted genes, including 2132 coding genes (Supplementary Figure S2A). Functional annotation revealed the presence of 162 carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes), including 74 glycoside hydrolases (GHs), 70 glycosyl transferases (GTs),12 proteins with carbohydratebinding modules (CBMs), five carbohydrate esterases (CEs), and one polysaccharide lyase (PL) (Figure 2C). This suggests that Akkermansia muciniphila can not only degrade mucin but can also metabolize and utilize carbohydrates and sugar phosphates. In addition, 1846 genes in the genome were assigned to functionally annotated orthologous groups, and the main functional classes included ‘amino acid transport and metabolism’ and ‘cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis’ (Figure 2D). Among the 146 kinds of antibiotic resistance genes in Akkermansia muciniphila (GCA_022769425.1), the most abundant antibiotic resistance gene was ‘macB , which gives resistance o macrolide antibiotics hrough he antibiotic efflux (Figure 2E, F). Finally, users can conveniently explore the relative position, gene size and gene function of various functional genes through the AnimalMetaOmics genome map module (Supplementary Figure S2B).  

# Metatranscriptome  

The metatranscriptome module includes 321 metatranscriptomic sequencing samples from 31 animal species, representing six taxonomic classes of hosts: Mammalia, Aves, Bivalvia,

Insecta, Arachnida and Clitellata. The most prevalent host taxonomic class was ‘Mammalia’, accounting for $77.26\%$ (248) of the samples. It was followed by ‘Aves’, representing $8.1\%$ (26  of the samples, and ‘Bivalvia’, representing $7.48\%$ (24  of the samples (Supplementary Figure S3). In the metatranscriptome module, users can explore and compare the composition of active microbial communities and the levels of gene expression in samples by searching for host, microorganism, or gene name.  

Case study 2: Exploring the differences in microbial composition and gene expression among Callithrix Jacchus gut samples. Entering he word Callithrix acchus  nto he global search box, hen clicking on Project’ PRJDB11511), here are 36 samples available from Callithrix jacchus  including samples from the cecum, colon, and feces (Figure 3A). The analysis results demonstrate variations in the microbial composition among he different samples. Prevotella copri s present n all samples, but its abundance differs across samples. Akkermansia muciniphila s only present n I6289M’ samples, while Clostridium perfringens only exists n I6027M’ sample. However, it’s worth noting that both of these microorganisms exhibit higher abundance in cecum samples (Figure 3B, C). The expression levels of specific microorganisms and functional gene can be searched and browsed (Supplementary Figure S4A, B).  

# Metaproteome  

The metaproteome module comprises protein identification results from 326 sequencing samples, including 123 samples from Mus musculus 113 samples rom Sus scrofa 66 samples from Bos aurus and 24 samples rom Gallus gallus Users can explore and compare the sequences and functional information of peptides or proteins expressed by bacteria, archaea and viruses in the samples by searching host, microorganism or gene names.

Case study 3: Investigating the composition and protein abundance of the microbial community in Gallus gallus samples. Entering the word ‘Gallus gallus  into the global search box, there are 24 samples available from Gallus gallus in the metaproteomics module of AnimalMetaOmics (Figure 4A). Among these samples, 4765 bacterial proteins, 233 archaeal proteins, and 56 viral proteins have been identified (Figure 4B). The most abundant bacterial protein is Elongation factor Tu (Figure 4C, D), which plays a crucial role in protein biosynthesis by facilitating the GTP-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the A-site of ribosomes (43 .  

# Pan-genome  

The pan-genome module contains 18453 genomes from 679 bacterial species and 13 archaeal species. All gene clusters were divided into four categories: core genes (genes present in all strains), soft core genes (genes present in $95{-}99\%$ of strains), shell genes (genes present in $15\mathrm{-}95\%$ of strains), and cloud genes (genes present in $<15\%$ of strains). Users can browse and compare the composition, and functional information of core, shell and cloud genes in microbial genomes by searching microorganism or gene names.  

Case study 4: Exploring the pan-genome composition and gene unction of Akkermansia muciniphila Entering he word ‘Akkermansia muciniphila  into the global search box, there are 27 strains of Akkermansia muciniphila from nine different animals. The pan-genome contains 5440 genes, of which 1233 genes constitute the core genome (Figure 5A, B). The accumulation curve shows that as the number of genomes increases, the gene repertoires of the pan-genome increase, whereas he core genome decreases Figure 5C). The gene able lists each gene and which strain t s present n Supplementary Figure S5).  

# Multi-omics integration analysis  

The multi-omics integration analysis module includes integration analysis of metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metaproteomic data form four animals (Bos taurus  Sus scrofa  Mus musculus  and Gallus gallus . Users can compare differences n microbial communities and unctions within he hosts and the differences of specific gene expression among different host populations by searching for the host or gene names.

Case study 5: Exploring uf gene expression across different hosts and omics layers. Entering the word ‘ uf  into the global search box, by conducting an analysis of gene counts and relative gene abundance across various omics data in four animal species, t was observed hat notable differences emerged n he transcriptional activity and expression levels of the tuf gene among these hosts. Among the four different animal hosts, the number of tuf gene is the largest in Bos taurus  the transcription activity of tuf gene is the highest in Sus scrofa  and the expression level of tuf gene is the richest in Mus musculus (Figure 6 .  

# Conclusion and future directions  

In his study, we constructed he AnimalMetaOmics by mining and analyzing metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, metaproteomic, and pan-genomic data from animals. Compared with other relevant published databases, AnimalMetaOmics has several advantages: (i) AnimalMetaOmics is the first meta-omics resources database that includes matagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metaproteomic data from animals; (ii) AnimalMetaOmics is a comprehensive animal microbial genomes and microbiomes database that includes comprehensive functional annotation of bacterial, archaeal, fungal, and viral genomes associated with animals; (iii) Animal  

MetaOmics provides cross-host and cross-sample site comparisons of microbial genomes, active microbial composition, and gene function and (iv) AnimalMetaOmics consistently annotates and analyzes the pan-genomes of bacteria and archaea from different animals, providing a comprehensive genetic landscape of species and dentifying characteristics of core and unique genes. To sum up, AnimalMetaOmics will better help researchers explore the classification and functional diversity of animal microbiota from different omics datasets.  

In the future, we will continuously improve AnimalMetaOmics by enhancing its features and functionalities, and continue to integrate and analyze new meta-omic datasets from various animal species, particularly metatranscriptomic and metaproteomic data. We will increase the integration analysis of diverse meta-omics datasets from various hosts, and show the differences in the abundance and relative activity of specific microbial, gene or protein within the different host. Furthermore, we have plans to add new contents to AnimalMetaOmics, especially animal metabolomics data and protozoa genome data from animal hosts.

We report a whole-genome shotgun assembly (called WGSA) of the human genome generated at Celera in 2001. The Celeragenerated shotgun data set consisted of 27 million sequencing reads organized in pairs by virtue of end-sequencing 2-kbp, 10-kbp, and 50-kbp inserts from shotgun clone libraries. The qualitytrimmed reads covered the genome 5.3 times, and the inserts from which pairs of reads were obtained covered the genome 39 times. With the nearly complete human DNA sequence [National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Build 34] now available, it is possible to directly assess the quality, accuracy, and completeness of WGSA and of the first reconstructions of the human genome reported in two landmark papers in February 2001 [Venter, J.

(2001) Science 291, 1304–1351; International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium (2001) Nature 409, 860–921]. The analysis of WGSA shows $97\%$ order and orientation agreement with NCBI Build 34, where most of the $3\%$ of sequence out of order is due to scaffold placement problems as opposed to assembly errors within the scaffolds themselves. In addition, WGSA fills some of the remaining gaps in NCBI Build 34. The early genome sequences all covered about the same amount of the genome, but they did so in different ways. The Celera results provide more order and orientation, and the consortium sequence provides better coverage of exact and nearly exact repeats.  

n 2000 Celera scientists in collaboration with the publicly funded Drosophila Genome Project published the wholegenome assembly of the Drosophila genome (1) with a description of the paired end sequencing strategy and the new algorithms (2) that enabled this historic assembly. Over the subsequent 2 years, remaining gaps in the Drosophila genome sequence were closed, and the order and orientation of the sequence were confirmed. The completed Drosophila genome sequence permitted a retrospective analysis of the quality of the initial whole-genome shotgun assembly (3). This study demonstrated that the computationally assembled genome sequence was highly accurate and served as a good substrate for finishing a eukaryotic genome (3).  

In February 2001 both Celera and the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium (IHGSC) published their first drafts of the human genome sequence (4, 5). In 2001 Celera conducted a whole-genome shotgun sequencing and assembly of the mouse genome based only on 26 million sequence reads generated at Celera (6) by using a refined version of the assembly software. The quality of the mouse assembly exceeded the quality of the reported (4) human assemblies, prompting a new assembly, called WGSA, of the human genome based on only  

Celera-generated data and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequences (7, 8). In 2003 the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) released Build 34 of the human genome, hereafter referred to as NCBI-34 (9, 10). Although this new sequence is not perfect and still has gaps, it constitutes a high-quality reference against which to evaluate the other human genome constructs and assemblies. We analyzed WGSA as well as the published sequences $(4,5)$ to see how much of the NCBI-34 sequence they cover and how well they reconstructed the order and orientation of the sequence.  

The independence of the genome assemblies reported by Celera (4) was challenged in this journal by the principal leaders of the IHGSC (11, 12). Therefore, we also show the differences in the results reported in refs. 4 and 5 by analyzing which parts of NCBI-34 are covered by each genome assembly. The assemblies cover comparable amounts of the genome but do so in clearly different patterns. As one would expect given 39 times coverage of the human genome in paired-end-sequenced plasmids, all three Celera assemblies have better order and orientation than the consortium sequence (5). The consortium’s clone by clone sequencing method, using BACs (5), resulted in better coverage of exact and nearly exact sequence repeat regions. Because of the presence of both male and female donors for Celera’s shotgun sequence, the coverage of the $\mathbf{\boldsymbol{X}}$ and especially the $\mathrm{\DeltaY}$ chromosomes is lower than that for the other chromosomes, resulting in a lower-quality assembly for these chromosomes.  

We have submitted the three Celera human genome sequences to GenBank to preserve the historical record and facilitate the ongoing analysis of the human genome.  

# Whole-Genome Shotgun Sequence of the Human Genome  

Although whole-genome shotgun sequencing was initially considered controversial when the first genome was sequenced (13), it has now become the prevailing approach. The vast majority of genomes sequenced to date have used this method (14), including the large genomes of Drosophila (1), Anopheles (15), Mus (6, 16), Fugu (17), and Canis (18).  

We present here a WGSA produced by Celera in December 2001 using only whole-genome shotgun sequence data. The Celera shotgun data set consisted of 27 million sequencing reads, of average quality-trimmed length 543 bp, organized in pairs by virtue of end-sequencing 2-kbp, 10-kbp, and 50-kbp inserts from shotgun clone libraries as described (1, 4). The trimmed sequence reads covered the genome 5.3 times, and the inserts for which pairs of reads were obtained covered the genome 39 times. In addition, 104,000 BAC-end-sequence pairs (7, 8) were used to augment the 50-kbp pairs in providing long range correlations. Assembly was performed with the Celera Assembler, originally described in ref. 2 with improvements made after publication of ref. 4.  

For such a low level of coverage and such a large genome, the assembly is remarkably coherent, consisting of 330 large scaffolds that constitute $99\%$ of the result, with the remaining $1\%$ divided across 4,610 small scaffolds under 100 kbp. The comparison of WGSA against NCBI-34 allows us to measure its completeness and quality, and to gauge the effort that would be required to finish a mammalian genome from such a sequence. The scaffolds of WGSA span $96.\Bar{3}\%$ of NCBI-34, and the contigs of these scaffolds reconstruct $92.7\%$ of the NCBI-34 sequence. Gaps comprised of a missing region of sequence in an existing clone are generally trivial to close. Of 206,552 such gaps between the contigs of the scaffolds, 201,735 are spanned by at least one 2-kbp or 10-kbp end-sequenced insert (as opposed to only BACs or 50-kbp inserts). All but 651 of the spanned gaps are flanked by contigs whose order and orientation is consistent with NCBI34. Thus, nearly half of the uncovered $7.3\%$ of NCBI-34 $(3.6\%)$ could be obtained simply by primer directed sequencing of the gaps in WGSA’s existing scaffolds. Moreover, 2,218 of the 4,610 small scaffolds under $100~\mathrm{kbp}$ are subsumed by larger scaffolds and could be properly placed during insert-based gap finishing. Both clone ordered and whole-genome shotgun sequence assemblies have had difficulties resolving the structure of large, highly identical duplications (refs. 19 and 20; Table 1). More than 83 Mbp of the $170^{\circ}\mathrm{Mbp}$ of NCBI-34 that are not represented in WGSA scaffolds involve such duplications. For WGSA, the largest concentration of duplicated sequence is within the unplaced scaffolds: $23\%$ of the unplaced scaffold sequence is so annotated, accounting for $12\%$ of the duplicated sequence that is present in WGSA. Random BAC sampling, or selected BAC sampling based on sequence-anchored probes, could be used to find clones spanning these regions in WGSA. In addition, the shotgun sequence has proven essential for evaluating the nature and extent of these duplications (20).  

We saw in 1999 that for Drosophila (1), increasing the genome coverage from 6.5 times to 11.2 times increased the sequence spanned by large scaffolds by $1.7\%$ and the sequence contained by $5.0\%$ , and reduced the number of gaps by $\bar{7}3.5\%$ . We would expect to see similar improvements if the whole-genome shotgun human data were increased from 5.3 times to 10 times. Given the increasing ratio of the cost of finishing work to shotgun sequencing, we are comfortable stipulating that this is an economical proposition. Finally, we expect WGSA algorithms to continue to improve as they have over the past 3 years. To aid in such improvements, we are making available the Celera Assembler and its source code (myscience.appliedbiosystems.com publicationscompassindex.jsp).  

A comparison of WGSA to the recently published chromosome 6 sequence (21) that is part of NCBI-34 illustrates that WGSA can also contribute to the continuing effort to produce a complete human genome sequence. Along chromosome 6, the authors report 10 remaining gaps, one missing sequence tagged site (STS) marker (D6S1694), and three RefSeq genes (NM004690, NM018452, and NM014034) that are only partially represented (21). The missing STS marker is present at its correct location and all three RefSeq genes are complete in WGSA. We corroborate the conjecture in ref. 21 that NM014034 was only partially found in NCBI-34 because of a deletionpolymorphism event in the P1-derived artificial chromosome (PAC) RP3–329L24 (AL132874.30). The first exon of NM014034 is contained in a 56,180-bp region of WGSA not present in NCBI-34, which maps between base pair 119,198,642 and its $3^{\prime}$ neighbor of NCBI-34 chromosome 6. Scanning the whole genome, we found evidence for more such polymorphismsdeletions. There are 573 locations where WGSA reports 1,000 or more bases in a spot where NCBI-34 reports less than 100 (see Data Set 4; Data Sets 1–8, Figs. 3–8, Tables 3–13, and supporting text files are published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). There are also 80 RefSeq genes where one finds at least $5\%$ more of the gene in WGSA than in NCBI-34 (Tables 6 and 7).  

Of the 10 gaps in NCBI-34’s chromosome 6, three are due to the centromere and telomeres. The WGSA sequence in the vicinity of the two other gaps near the centromere is rearranged with respect to NCBI-34, suggesting a possible region of largescale polymorphism. The WGSA scaffold spanning the second gap near the centromere suggests that the NCBI-34 contig just after the centromere should be inverted, leaving a 10-kbp gap (Fig. 7). One gap does not exist in WGSA, suggesting that it is an error in NCBI-34 or is due to a large, near-perfect tandem duplication. The four remaining gaps are largely closed by a total of 691 kbp of WGSA (Fig. 8), and NCBI-34 has 180 kbp that belong in these gaps but were not placed there. In addition, the missing STS marker, D6S1694, is found in the correct position within one of these gaps.  

Over the entire genome, there are 196 gaps in NCBI-34 that are spanned by WGSA. Of the gaps, 38 are completely filled by 85,839 bp, and 136 are partially filled by 3.341 Mbp (Data Set 5). Furthermore, for 56 of these gaps WGSA reveals that at least 2.438 Mbp of unassigned sequence from NCBI-34 belong in those gaps (Data Set 6). Fig. 1a illustrates the ability of WGSA to resolve probable remaining errors of order and orientation of NCBI-34 contigs. Fig. $1b$ illustrates the potential for filling gaps between contigs. WGSA also contributes additional sequence beyond filling gaps in NCBI-34 (Table 1); as with the Drosophila genome sequencing (22), this sequence may be from heterochromatic regions not covered by the clone-by-clone approach.  

# The First Human Genome Reconstructions  

The first human genome sequences were reported in February 2001 (4, 5). While Celera produced a whole-genome shotgun data set (as described in ref. 4 and above), the IHGSC produced and deposited into GenBank 33,000 BAC-based data entries in a variety of finished states. Twenty percent of the BACs represented a finished sequence, whereas $75\%$ of the BACs consisted of contigs produced by a PHRAP (www.phrap.org) assembly of a 3–5 times shotgun sequencing of the BAC, which produced an average of 20 contigs with an average length of 8 kbp. The remaining $5\%$ of BACs consisted of only a 1 times sampling of unassembled sequence reads.

Fig. 1. Dot-plot representation of sample assembly comparison results. Horizontal axes correspond to intervals along NCBI-34, and vertical axes correspond to intervals along various assemblies, with the sequences starting from the bottom left corner. Diagonal lines show the relative positions and orientations of matches. Identical sequences would yield one diagonal line. Vertical bars represent gaps between NCBI-34 contigs. Selected regions were chosen to represent general observations regarding the assemblies; related figures of entire chromosomes are provided for all chromosomes in Data Set 7. (a) Illustration of a region in which WGSA can augment NCBI-34. Shown are the first 6 Mbp of NCBI-34 human chromosome 1 versus part of a single scaffold of WGSA. The second NCBI-34 contig is inverted, and the third and fourth contigs are interchanged, compared with WGSA. We postulate that this is an NCBI-34 contig mapping problem. Alternative explanations, such as misassembly or polymorphisms within the WGSA scaffold that coincidentally occur at the boundaries of NCBI-34 contigs, are improbable. (b–f) Comparison of the NCBI-34 human chromosome 1 region from 34–40 Mbp against the primary matching regions of WGSA (b), WGA (c), CSA (d), HG06 (e), and NCBI-28 ( f). (See main text for description of assemblies.) WGSA agrees closely with NCBI-34 and spans and largely fills two gaps between NCBI-34 contigs. All other assemblies have multiple order and orientation errors. For all but HG06, the misplaced segments correspond to entire scaffolds (data not shown). For HG06, errors are a mix of within-scaffold rearrangements and scaffold order and orientation. WGA and HG06 both have a relatively large number of small, misplaced scaffolds, whereas CSA and NCBI-28 have a few, larger scaffolds that are misplaced.  

Celera produced two assemblies based on different approaches (4). Both used, in addition to the 5.3 times shotgun data, the GenBank data set above, shredded into 550-bp reads forming a 2 times tiling of the BAC sequence contigs. The combined whole-genome assembly (called WGA) was obtained by applying the Celera assembler to the 27 million Celera reads and 16 million shredded reads from the GenBank data. The  

Celera assembler used only Celera’s paired reads and the BAC end reads to order and orient configs. The second assembly reported (4, 23, 24), the compartmental shotgun assembly (CSA), first used the BAC organization of the data to determine 3,800 ‘‘compartments’’ consisting of BACs and associated Celera data that were determined to cover a given region of a chromosome using Celera’s read pairs and inferred sequence overlaps between the BACs. The GenBank data for each compartment was then shredded, combined with Celera’s data for the region, and assembled with the Celera assembler, again using only the end-sequence pairs to order and orient contigs within scaffolds (4). The final step for all of the assemblies was to place the scaffolds (Celera) or the fingerprint clone contigs (IHGSC) onto chromosomal locations, based primarily on STS maps. Additional information was used for Celera’s CSA (4) and consortium assemblies (5), but for Celera’s WGA and WGSA assemblies only the STS maps were used.  

An IHGSC result available shortly after ref. 5, herein referred to as HG06, was built from the GenBank sequence data as of December 2000, and a physical map of its 33,000 BACs (25). The physical map was assembled by using HindIII restriction digest fingerprints of 354,000 BACs, including the 33,000 selected for sequencing. As described in ref. 5, contigs from adjoining BAC assemblies were partially ordered and merged based on the BAC overlaps in the physical map. Contigs were further ordered by mapping exons of RefSeq sequences (26) and ESTs, and 1.8 million read pairs from inserts ranging between 2 kbp and 6 kbp that were stored in the SNP consortium database (27).  

In addition to these reported assemblies (4, 5), we also evaluate two assemblies contemporaneous with WGSA. The first is NCBI Build 28 (NCBI-28), based on the consortium data available in December 2001 (when WGSA was produced). The second assembly is another combined whole-genome assembly (WGA2) which was produced at the same time as WGSA to take full advantage of all of the data available. The set of GenBank sequence from September 2001 used for WGA2 had $1.7\%$ more basepairs than the December 2000 set used for WGA. Comparing WGSA, which used only whole-genome shotgun data, and WGA2 shows how much additional sequence of the genome is recovered by adding GenBank data to Celera’s shotgun data, because both were assembled with the same version of the software.  

# Evaluation of the Assemblies Against NCBI-34  

Methods and Summary Statistics. We have developed a suite of tools, A2Amapper, for constructing a one-to-one correspondence between pairs of assemblies. Like other whole-genome comparison methods (28–31), A2Amapper is based on the identification of seed alignments, in this case unique exact matches, followed by a more aggressive local alignment phase between seeds within nonoverlapping chains of seeds. Cutoffs were carefully tuned to balance sensitivity (finding all correlations), specificity (finding only the true ones), and computational requirements (see Data Set 1). Details about A2Amapper will be presented elsewhere (H.S., J.R.M., C.M.M., M.J.F., S.Y., and G.G.S., unpublished work; R.L., X. Zhao, L.F., C.M.M., and S.I., unpublished work). A2Amapper produces a set of one-to-one matches that are alignments of nearly identical pairs of segments imputed to be analogous up to polymorphisms. Each match aligns a segment of the target genome against a segment of NCBI-34. The segments are nonoverlapping by construction, and we consider the coverage of NCBI-34 to be the sum of the lengths of these segments. This set of matches is the basis for further analysis regarding correctness of order and orientation for which we develop three concepts: runs, heaviest common subsequence, and clumps. One match is consistent with another if in each assembly the segments of the matches are in the same relative order and orientation with no intervening matches  

Table 2. Similarity of genome content I(A, B) between pairs of assemblies A and B

Cells are coded for low, medium, and high similarity by plain, bold, and underlined bold text, respectively. Let $c_{\mathsf{A}}$ be the fraction of NCBI-34 covered by assembly A, and let $c_{A\cap B}$ be the fraction shared by both assemblies A and B. If both assemblies A and B cover large amounts of the genome $\overset{\cdot}{C}_{\mathsf{A}}$ and $c_{\mathsf{B}})$ , then they must also share a large portion of the genome $(C_{\mathsf{A}\cap\mathsf{B}})$ . If A and B are unrelated samplings, then one would expect $c_{\mathsf{A}}$ and $c_{\mathsf{B}}$ to be randomly chosen fractions, and $c_{A\cap B}$ would equal $c_{\mathsf{A}}{\cdot}c_{\mathsf{B}}$ . If A and B are maximally similar, then one would be completely subsumed by the other and $c_{A\cap B}$ would equal min(cA, $c_{\mathsf{B}})$ . So let $I(\mathsf{A},\mathsf{B})=(c_{\mathsf{A}\cap\mathsf{B}}-c_{\mathsf{A}}{\cdot}c_{\mathsf{B}})/(\mathsf{m i n}(c_{\mathsf{A}},c_{\mathsf{B}})-c_{\mathsf{A}}{\cdot}c_{\mathsf{B}})\in[0,1]$ ] be a normalized measure between these two extremes, where $I(\mathsf{A},\mathsf{B})$ is 0 if A and B are unrelated, and 1 if they are maximally similar.  

between them. A run is a maximal chain of consistent matches. The heaviest common subsequence between two genomes is a subset of the matches for which the sum of the lengths of the matches is maximal and removing all other matches from consideration leaves a single run. Intuitively, the heaviest common subsequence is a global measure of the largest subset of the two assemblies that agree with each other. A clump is a run of 50 kbp or more that can be obtained by eliminating out-of-order matches, giving a local equivalent of the heaviest common subsequence (Supporting Text 1).  

Coverage and Order and Orientation. Although the more recent assemblies (WGSA and WGA2) have distanced themselves significantly from the earlier ones (CSA, WGA, and HG06) in terms of quality, the earlier assemblies covered $86-88\%$ of NCBI-34 (Table 1). CSA and WGA placed $79-80\%$ of the covered sequence in the correct order and orientation, whereas HG06 positioned $74\%$ correctly. This improved order and orientation is also demonstrated by longer runs and clumps and higher mate pair satisfaction rates (see Supporting Text 2 and Tables 9 and 10) for CSA and WGA relative to HG06 (Table 1). HG06 displayed a greater match length, mostly reflecting the larger numbers of gaps between contigs in the Celera drafts. In the case of WGA, nearly $9\%$ of matches to NCBI-34 are found on unmapped scaffolds (Table 1), with an additional $10\%$ being in mismapped scaffolds, whereas less than $1\%$ of sequence involved an intra-scaffold conflict. This implies that most of the order and orientation conflicts were due to incorrect mapping of scaffolds and not the order of contigs within a scaffold. HG06 shows a large amount, more than $16\%$ , of sequence in scaffolds that are in the wrong location or orientation, and has more than $9\%$ of the total sequence in conflict with the majority of the containing scaffold. In addition to mismapped scaffolds, all assemblies had subscaffold segments that were misplaced (Table 1). Many such small discrepancies were assembly errors that could be corrected by routine gap closure, as discussed above.  

WGSA and WGA2 provide $93\%$ and $96\%$ coverage of NCBI34, of which ${\approx}97\%$ is in globally consistent order and orientation. The quality of WGSA is remarkable in light of it having less input data than any other assembly, although it does have three clear limitations: relatively short contigs largely reflecting low coverage, unresolved ubiquitous repeats, and missing segmental duplications. The latter is reflected by low run coverage near NCBI-34’s centromeres (Data Set 3). Manual curation of WGSA identified 16 clearly chimeric scaffolds and 3,912 smaller segments totaling 8.1 Mbp that were also out of order, reflecting some combination of misassembled contigs, transpositions within a scaffold, structural polymorphism between donors, and errors in the one-to-one mapping produced by A2Amapper. (Fig. 1a illustrates why a manual curation of order and orientation discrepancies is necessary.) Probably because of low shotgun sequence coverage, a disproportionate number of the discrepancies are on the $\mathbf{\boldsymbol{X}}$ and $\mathrm{\DeltaY}$ chromosomes. NCBI-28, a contemporary of WGSA, had similarly high coverage, but despite generally longer contigs and scaffolds, its order and orientation results were closer to those of the earlier assemblies, reflecting problems with mapping scaffolds onto chromosomes. The general patterns described above regarding order and orientation are illustrated in Fig. 1.  

CSA, WGA, and HG06 all cover $86-88\%$ of NCBI-34 (Table 1), yet their union covers $96.7\%$ . Since the input to the CSA and WGA assemblies included a representation of almost all of the data input to the HG06 assembly, one must conclude that the differing methods of construction reproduced different parts of the genome. If the CSA and WGA assemblies were merely reconstituting the shredded BAC data and adding a little additional data, then both CSA and WGA should be slight supersets of HG06 and they clearly are not. Table 2 shows a statistical measure of similarity for various pairs of assemblies. Despite the fact that WGA and CSA involved the GenBank data, WGA, CSA, and WGSA are all quite different from HG06 and quite similar to each other. One can get a picture of the impact of adding shredded GenBank data to Celera’s 5.3 times shotgun data set by examining a pair of assemblies performed with the same version of the assembly software where one uses just Celera data, and the other uses the combined data set. The only pair of assemblies satisfying this property is WGSA and WGA2. Close examination reveals that WGA2 is largely a superset of WGSA. There are $12.7~\mathrm{Mbp}$ in WGSA lost in WGA2 because of the addition of the shredded data, but $114.4\ \mathrm{Mbp}$ are gained in WGA2, 90.0 Mbp of which are filling gaps in WGSA scaffolds. Thus adding the shredded reads resulted in $3.4\%$ more of the genome being reconstructed with contig statistics improving as expected for the given increase in coverage.

# Evaluation of the Assemblies Against RefSeq  

A good indicator for the annotation potential of a genome is the rate and quality of mapping of known full-length mRNA sequences, for instance those contained in the RefSeq repository (26). We developed a high-throughput mapping tool, called ESTmapper (L.F. and B.W., unpublished work), to efficiently align full-length and first-pass cDNA (mRNA, EST) sequences to a sequence assembly. Like its predecessor SIM4 (32), ESTmapper generates a nucleotide-level alignment between the query sequence and the target genome. We mapped the 19,667 human mRNA sequences in the August 2003 RefSeq data set to each of the genomes at different coverage cutoffs (Fig. 2 and Data Set 2). With small exceptions, the order that this measure induces on the set of assemblies does not change with varying coverage cutoffs. The more complete assemblies (WGA2 and NCBI-34) performed better than WGSA, which in turn shows considerably higher integrity than the earlier assemblies (WGA, CSA, and HG06) at all but the highest coverage thresholds. As the performance of WGSA versus WGA2 reveals, it is completeness rather than continuity of order and orientation that is the main issue: WGSA has a part of almost every gene that

WGA2 and NCBI-34 do, but because it is an assembly of only 5.3 times data, enough sequence is missing to cause a larger drop as the coverage threshold increases. Further evidence of this observation is that 470 RefSeq sequences have less than $95\%$ of their base pairs mapped to NCBI-34, whereas only 89 sequences were inconsistent with NCBI-34’s sequence order. The same pattern holds for all of the other assemblies. WGA2, based only on a slight update on the original combined data sets, is nearly as complete as NCBI-34.  

# Conclusion  

The Celera Assembler, first described in 2000 with the successful assembly of the Drosophila genome (1), was used with modification for the initial assemblies of the human genome reported in (4), and with further modification was used for the successful assembly of the mouse genome (6), the dog genome (18), and the Anopheles mosquito genome (15). The same assembler was used for the whole-genome shotgun assembly of the human genome reported here. With coverage of $92.7\%$ of the NCBI-34 sequence, and continuity close to that of NCBI-34, WGSA clearly shows that a high-quality genome sequence can be assembled from the Celera proprietary data alone, independently of the IHGSC data and methods. Indeed, WGSA provides valuable additions and corrections to the nearly complete human genome, NCBI-34. Thus, whole-genome shotgun assembly can give a high-quality draft, much higher than that originally released by either Celera or the IHGSC, of a higher eukaryote at a remarkably modest level of coverage.

# ABSTRACT  

Mitochondria are the only organelles in the animal cells that have their own genome. Due to a key role in energy production, generation of damaging factors (ROS, heat), and apoptosis, mitochondria and mtDNA in particular have long been considered one of the major players in the mechanisms of aging, longevity and age-related diseases. The rapidly increasing number of species with fully sequenced mtDNA, together with accumulated data on longevity records, provides a new fascinating basis for comparative analysis of the links between mtDNA features and animal longevity. To facilitate such analyses and to support the scientific community in carrying these out, we developed the MitoAge database containing calculated mtDNA compositional features of the entire mitochondrial genome, mtDNA coding (tRNA, rRNA, protein-coding genes) and non-coding (D-loop) regions, and codon usage/amino acids frequency for each protein-coding gene. MitoAge includes 922 species with fully sequenced mtDNA and maximum lifespan records. The database is available through the MitoAge website (www.mitoage.org or www.mitoage.info), which provides the necessary tools for searching, browsing, comparing and downloading the data sets of interest for selected taxonomic groups across the Kingdom Animalia. The MitoAge website assists in statistical analysis of different features of the mtDNA and their correlative links to longevity.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Mitochondria are the only organelles in the animal cells that have their own genome. The stability of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is vital for mitochondrial proper functioning; therefore, changes in mtDNA may have far-reaching consequences for the cell fate and, ultimately, for the whole organism. Not surprisingly, due to a key role in energy production, generation of damaging factors (ROS, heat), and regulation of apoptosis, mitochondria and mtDNA in particular have long been considered one of the major players in the mechanisms of aging, longevity and age-related diseases (1–6).  

Mitochondrial DNA exists in multiple copies and typically contains genes encoding for 13 key subunits of the respiratory chain enzymes, a set of 22 tRNA genes, and 2 genes for the large (16S) and small (12S) rRNA subunits. In contrast to the nuclear DNA, mtDNA is a circular, intronless, extremely compact molecule, with asymmetric distribution of nucleotides between the heavy (G-rich) and light (C-rich) strands (7,8). With very few exceptions, such structure of mtDNA is typical for the vast majority of animal species.  

Longevity (generally estimated by maximum lifespan, MLS) varies greatly among animal species (9) (genomics.senescence.info/species). Species also differ in their mtDNA compositional features (10), which to a great extent may determine the mtDNA stability and mutability. A few lines of evidence point towards a putative significance of mtDNA in aging and longevity. Firstly, mtDNA mutations accumulate with advanced age (5,11,12). Secondly, strong correlative links between mammalian MLS and mtDNA compositional features have been found (4,6,13– 18).  

The rapidly increasing number of species with fully sequenced mtDNA genomes, together with accumulated data on longevity records, provide now a strong basis for comprehensive comparative analysis of the links between mtDNA features and animal longevity. Yet, efficient processing of such amount of data is computationally demanding. In turn, this generates a need for appropriate databases and bioinformatics tools. With the creation of MitoAge, we aim to encourage the modeling of mtDNA-longevity relationships, providing the scientific community with one single place to access, compare and analyze the data, based on most updated resources. MitoAge (www.mitoage.org, www.mitoage.info) is a curated, publicly available database, which contains an extensive repository of mtDNA data integrated with longevity records and the results of the statistical and correlative analysis of the links between them.

# DATABASE CONTENT AND INTERFACE  

To date, 5337 entries with complete mitochondrial genomes and 4237 entries with longevity records are available at NCBI RefSeq database and the AnAge database, respectively (see the Data Sources section). The overlap of these two data sets after curation, encompassing 922 animal species covering 304 families, 106 orders and 13 classes from the Kingdom Animalia, was included in MitoAge, Build 1.0. As seen in Table 1, the vast majority of species are vertebrates, with only few representatives of invertebrates.  

MitoAge contains compositional features (base content, $G C\%$ , $\mathbf{AT\%}$ , sequence length) of the entire mitochondrial genome, mtDNA coding (tRNA, rRNA, protein-coding genes) and non-coding (D-loop) regions for each species and taxonomic group. For protein-coding genes of a given species, codon usage with distribution of codons by base position (e.g. codons with first base G, C, A or T) and amino acids frequencies are included. Along with mtDNA data, longevity records (MLS) are presented.  

Additionally, the MitoAge database tools provide the user with a number of options for (i) computation of basic statistics (range, median, mean $\pm$ standard deviation, coefficient of variation, Pearson’s coefficient of correlation with log-transformed MLS); (ii) comparison of stats between selected taxonomic groups (two or more); (iii) data export for a data set of interest (in a CSV format), without downloading the entire database. If a user needs a more complex analysis, the website allows downloading the entire database, which can be done from the Download page in versioned releases (numbered database builds).  

MitoAge has a user-friendly website interface with simple and intuitive navigation tools (Figures 1 and 2). Searching can be done either by species common or scientific name, or by taxonomy groups (i.e. by classes, orders or families). Alternatively, the data can be reached by Browsing in three different ways: (i) Browsing Taxonomy (classes, orders, families or species); (ii) Browsing Stats, which calculates on-thefly statistical information for the total mtDNA or specific genes/regions for the selected taxonomic group; (iii) Browsing Genes, an option similar to that of browsing stats, but providing data restricted to a gene of interest.

# DATA SOURCES AND DATA CURATION  

The MitoAge database was constructed using publicly available data, is being constantly updated through automatic tools and is manually curated for problematic issues.  

Complete mtDNA sequences were taken from NCBI RefSeq database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq) (19); longevity records were retrieved from the HAGR: Human Ageing Genomic Resources––AnAge database (genomics.senescence.info/species) (9), and full taxonomy data were retrieved from the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) on-line database [31-Jul-2015 Build] (www.itis.gov).  

Most of the data included in the MitoAge database were computed offline, using a series of automated scripts and programs developed in our lab, with a number of parameters computed on-the-fly through the website. Together with a series of administration tools, this ensures frequent updates of the database.  

Data were computed and analyzed as follows: (i) base composition and size were generated for total mtDNA and its specific regions/genes (D-loop, protein-coding genes, rRNA-coding genes and tRNA-coding genes); (ii) for each protein-coding gene and for the total protein-coding sequence, both base composition and codon usage/amino acids frequency were computed.  

All data available at MitoAge have undergone a threestep validation: (i) the collected raw data from NCBI RefSeq was processed through our software and log files were generated; (ii) reports of errors and inconsistencies from log files were then manually curated; and finally (iii) additional tests for database consistency (e.g. duplicates, faulty values, etc.) were performed by the administrative tools in the MitoAge website. The list of errors and inconsistencies found in the mtDNA sequence annotations were reported to the NCBI admin and subsequently corrected by the NCBI team. Upon successful validation, the corrected data were uploaded into the MitoAge database and various statistical metrics were computed.  

# DATA CALCULATION  

The compositional features of the mtDNA heavy strand (H-strand) were mostly considered (unless indicated otherwise), since the H-strand represents a primary target for the directional mutation pressure (20). For computing codon usage, data were taken from the complement of the coding strand and Thymine (T) was replaced with Uracil (U) (i.e. transforming it into the mRNA sequence). When combining multiple genes (e.g. when computing the total proteincoding genes), we append one gene to another and use the entire sequence for the analysis. In case of overlap between genes, we count the overlapping sequences only once for the computation of base composition, and we count them twice for the computation of codon usage and amino acids frequencies for each gene. Sequences are always analyzed from $5^{\prime}$ to $3^{\prime}$ (both for DNA and RNA).  

# AVAILABILITY  

The MitoAge database is available at www.mitoage.org and www.mitoage.info, with the data made available under the permissive Creative Commons license, allowing data to be used in other analyses. There are options to either download the entire database or its parts, or to export specific results of the website. Feedback via email is welcome.  

# CONCLUSION  

The MitoAge database is an integrated web resource for comparative analysis of mtDNA, with a special focus on animal longevity. Thus, it fills the gap in one of the ‘hot spots’ at the crossroad of aging research, evolutionary and mitochondrial biology. MitoAge novelties, together with a userfriendly interface, provide unique capabilities for in-depth investigation of: (i) the abundance of mtDNA bases and its variability across animal taxa with different MLS; (ii) the links between longevity and the mtDNA compositional features (total, region or gene-specific), including codon usage and amino acids frequency. Using the MitoAge database, we revealed more than 3780 statistically significant correlations between mtDNA features and animal longevity in different taxonomic groups. MitoAge could be also a useful supporting tool for building predictive models of animal longevity, involving mtDNA features.

# ABSTRACT  

Malaria is a tropical parasitic disease caused by the Plasmodium genus, which resulted in an estimated 219 million cases of malaria and 435 000 malariarelated deaths in 2017. Despite the availability of the Plasmodiumfalciparumgenome since 2002, $74\%$ of the genes remain uncharacterized. To remedy this paucity of functional information, we used transcriptomic data to build gene co-expression networks for two Plasmodium species (P alciparum and P. berghei), and included genomic data of four other Plasmodium species, P yoeli P knowlesi P vivax and P cynomolgi, as well as two non-Plasmodium species from the Apicomplexa, Toxoplasma gondi and Theileriaparva.The genomic and transcriptomic data were incorporated into the resulting database, malaria.tools, which is preloaded with tools that allow the identification and cross-species comparison of co-expressed gene neighbourhoods, clusters and life stage-specific expression, thus providing sophisticated tools to predict gene function. Moreover, we exemplify how the tools can be used to easily identify genes relevant for pathogenicity and various life stages of the malaria parasite. The database is freely available at www.malaria.tools.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Malaria is a widespread infectious disease transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito that caused an estimated $219\mathrm{mil}$ - lion cases and $435~000$ malaria-related deaths in the year 2017 (1). It is caused by various Plasmodium species with $P.$ falciparum and $P.$ vivax being the two most widespread and deadly for humans (2). Over the years, varying degrees of resistance have emerged in Plasmodium against all drugs used for treating malaria. Hence, it is a race against time to find new treatments, and this requires an understanding of malaria biology, and more specifically, the characterization of genes and their functions in order to develop drugs that target genes responsible for pathogenicity.  

Despite the availability of genomes of the various Plasmodium parasites for already more than a decade, many of the genes have unknown functions. These genes are often parasite-specific (3), thus making conventional gene function prediction methods that are based on homology to genes from other organisms less efficient. To this end, alternative methods for gene function prediction such as gene co-expression networks have been developed. The rationale behind using gene co-expression networks stems from the observation that functionally related genes have similar gene expression profiles (4). Thus, by identifying clusters of genes that have highly similar expression profiles, we attain groups of functionally related genes where the function of uncharacterized genes can be inferred from its neighbours.  

We have built the database malaria.tools (www.malaria. tools) based on the CoNekT database framework (5) using publicly available RNA sequencing data of two model Plasmodium species. This database calculates gene co-expression networks from gene expression data obtained from more than 800 experiments and contains multiple tools to predict gene function from co-expression network neighbours, co-expressed clusters and specific expression profiles. Additionally, an in-built phylogenetic tree function combined with gene expression comparison allows Plasmodium researchers to identify orthologs of $P.$ falciparum genes. Malaria.tools provides the malaria research community with a comprehensive and highly valuable resource for an efficient characterization of genes based on their expression profile, and will aid in the identification of potential drug targets in silico in the race for new antimalarial drugs.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

Publicly available RNA sequencing experiments were identified through NCBI SRA (6) and include experiments such as developmental stages, gene knockout variants and chemical treatment. The corresponding publication of the various experiments, if available, is provided in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4. Using the SRA run accession, RNA sequencing experiments for $P.$ falciparum and $P.$ berghei were downloaded as fastq files from European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (7) via aspera v3.8.1.160447. For pairedend experiments, only the file containing the first read, designated with ‘ 1’, was downloaded. To remove possible RNA contaminants from the parasite’s hosts, the reads were mapped first against human and mouse for $P.$ falciparum and $P.$ berghei, respectively. The unmapped reads were then mapped against the mosquito vector. Human mosquito vector was used for both Plasmodium species as the CDS of the mouse mosquito vector was unavailable. Unmapped reads were mapped against the respective Plasmodium species, and experiments with at least 1 million reads and $50\%$ of reads mapped to the Plasmodium species were used to construct the database.  

The mapping was done using kallisto v0.44.0 (8). Kallisto index files were generated for Homo sapiens (GCF 000001405.38), Anopheles gambiae (GCF 000005575.2), P. falciparum 3D7 and $P.$ berghei ANKA CDS sequences with default parameters. Both paired and single libraries were treated as single end libraries for mapping using kallisto quant for single end library with estimated fragment length of 200 bp, estimated standard deviation of 20 and pseudobam option. Unmapped reads from the output BAM files were written into a new fastq file using samtools v1.9–52-g651bf14 (9).  

In total, 206 experiments from $P.$ berghei (Supplementary Figure S1A) and 620 experiments from $P.$ falciparum (Supplementary Figure S1B) were included in database and annotated based on the information available from NCBI Sequence Read Archive, ENA and literature (Supplementary Table S3 $P.$ berghei) and Supplementary Table S4 ( $P.$ falciparum)). Transcripts Per Kilobase Million (TPM) values were represented as an expression matrix where genes are arranged in rows and experiments in columns. The expression matrices are available in Supplementary Table S1 for $P.$ berghei and Supplementary Table S2 for $P.$ falciparum. Highest Reciprocal Rank (HRR) co-expression networks were then constructed (10).  

CDS sequences, gene annotations and associated GO terms for the eight species in the database were obtained from the various sources described in Table 1. Superfamily and Pfam domain annotations from interproscan v5.32–71.0 (11) were used as sequence description when descriptions were not available. Aliases were imported from GeneDB and PlasmoDB, if available (12,13). Groups of orthologous genes (Supplementary Table S5) and phylogenetic trees were obtained from Orthofinder v1.1.8 (14) using BLAST for sequence similarity inference with default settings. The database was based on the CoNekt database framework (5) with default settings, where Heuristic Cluster Chiseling Algorithm (HCCA) (10) cluster size was limited to 100 genes. Experiments involving wild-type Plasmodium were further binned according to its various life stages (ring, trophozoite, schizont, male gametocyte and female gametocyte) and used to calculate tissue specificity. Nucleotide and protein blast databases for blastn and blastp were created using makeblastdb ${\mathrm{v}}2.9.0+{}$ (15).  

# RESULTS  

Malaria.tools offers a wide selection of tools to query the database. For example, the user can find the genes of interest by using BLAST, gene IDs (e.g. PF3D7 1223100) and keywords (e.g. rhoptry). Genes that work together in a specific biological process or contain a particular domain can be identified by querying the database with Gene Ontology terms (e.g. GO:0009405) or a Pfam domain (e.g. VSA Rifin), respectively. The database offers multiple comparative genomic and transcriptomic tools that allow the user to view and compare expression profiles within and across species, and to investigate the phylogenetic and expression relationships of gene families. A full description of the features is found at https://malaria.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/ features. To exemplify some of the features of malaria.tools, we provide three analyses showing typical case studies.  

# Identification of a co-expression neighbourhood important for erythrocyte invasion  

A co-expression neighbourhood consists of a gene of interest and its co-expressed genes (neighbours) calculated based on Highest Reciprocal Rank (HRR). To identify co-expression neighbourhood of interest to malaria researchers, we calculated which genes are network neighbour to already functionally characterized genes. We identified gene PF3D7 1223100, which was co-expressed with 91 other genes of which 48 $(53\%)$ are annotated with specific GO terms indicating that experimental evidence for the gene function already exists (e.g. evidence codes EXP, IDA, IPI). The high percentage of functionally characterized genes in this neighbourhood indicates that the corresponding biological process has received special attention from the malaria researchers, likely due to its involvement in pathogenicity. Indeed, the enriched GO terms in the neighbourhood are ‘entry into host’ and ‘movement in host environment’ (available from Functional Annotation/Predicted GO on https://malaria.sbs.ntu.edu. sg/sequence/view/16011), suggesting that the neighbourhood is important for the invasion of the host cell.  

To gain further insight into the function of this neighbourhood, we first studied the expression profile of PF3D7 1223100. The expression profiles in malaria.tools are available in a detailed format that showcase expression in all annotated samples (Figure 1A), and as an average expression in the major life stages of malaria (Figure 1B, https://malaria.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/profile/view/8699). In both expression profiles, we observed that PF3D7 1223100 and its co-expressed genes are expressed in all major life stages with particularly high expression in the schizont stage (Figure 1A and B). Next, we retrieved publications on the functional characterization of the genes and we found that the highly studied genes are clearly associated with functions important for erythrocyte invasion. The genes can be classified into three major groups relating to motility, cytoadherence and erythrocyte invasion. Genes relating to the glideosome complex [PF3D7 0918000 (GAP50) (16), PF3D7 1323700 (GAPM1) (17)], the inner membrane complex (18) [PF3D7 0109000 (PHIL1) and PF3D7 1003600 (IMC1c)] and cytoskeleton (19,20) [PF3D7 1251200 (coronin), PF3D7 0932200 (Profilin) and PF3D7 1246200 (Actin 1)] are essential for the parasite to move towards a new red blood cell through gliding motility. Upon reaching the red blood cell, merozoite surface proteins such as PF3D7 1035400 (MSP3), PF3D7 1335100 (MSP7), PF3D7 1035500 (MSP6) (21) and PF3D7 1035700 (DBLMSP) facilitate the binding of the parasite to the red blood cell. Finally, erythrocyte invasion is enabled by various genes such as enzymes [PF3D7 0507500 (SUB1) (22), PF3D7 1136500 (casein kinase 1) (23) and PF3D7 0404700 (DPAP3) (24)], signalling mediators (25) [PF3D7 0934800 (PKAc), PF3D7 1223100 (PKAr)], rhoptry proteins (26,27) (PF3D7 0929400 (RhopH2), PF3D7 0905400 (RhopH3), PF3D7 1410400 (RAP1), PF3D7 0414900 (ARO), PF3D7 1017100 (RON12), PF3D7 0501600 (RAP2), PF3D7 0817700 (RON5)] and others [PF3D7 0423800 (CyRPA) (28), PF3D7 0935800 (CLAG9) (29), PF3D7 0612700 (P12), PF3D7 0404900 (P41) (30)]. The schizont is a non-infective life stage during the erythrocytic cycle. However, a mature schizont contains multiple merozoites, which upon rupture of the schizont moves and invades fresh erythrocytes. In the co-expression neighbourhood of PF3D7 1223100, we observe an upregulation of merozoite and erythrocyte invasion-related genes during the schizont stage. In conclusion, the remaining $47\%$ of genes in this cluster that are not yet functionally characterized are prime candidates for further studies on parasite motility, cytoadherence and erythrocyte invasion.

# Comparative transcriptomic analysis of gene modules involved in male gametocyte-specific motility  

Comparative transcriptomic analyses can reveal that gene modules are conserved across species (31), thus enabling the identification of the core genetic components of specific biological processes (32,33). Malaria.tools provides two methods to extract these conserved transcriptional programs by (i) identifying common gene families that are specifically expressed in a particular life stage of two malaria species or by (ii) identifying conserved clusters of co-expressed genes.  

Using the first method to identify conserved transcriptional programs, we navigated to ‘Tools\Compare specificities’, selected species $P.$ falciparum and $P.$ berghei, set condition ‘Gametocyte (male) for both species and clicked ‘Compare specificity’. The database first identified genes that are preferentially expressed in male gametocytes in both species (specificity measure $\left(\mathrm{SPM}\right)>0.85)$ (34), which revealed that 187 gene families are expressed at this life stage in both parasites (Figure 2A, Supplementary Table S6). The table below the Venn diagram shows the identity and links to the 187 gene families, and clicking on a gene family followed by the tree links depicted the phylogenetic and expression relationships of the genes in the family. Not surprisingly, many of the gene families show conserved male gametocyte-specific expression in the two Plasmodium species, as exemplified by the phylogenetic tree of gene family OG0000502 (Figure 2B, https://malaria.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/tree/view/503), indicating that this family is male gametocyte-specific. Interestingly, we also observed cases where only one of the clades of the phylogenetic tree showed a male gametocyte-specific expression (Figure 2C, OG0000055, https://malaria.sbs.ntu. edu.sg/tree/view/56), suggesting that for this particular gene family an ancient gene duplication took place in the ancestor of the Plasmodium species followed by either a subfunctionalization or neo-functionalization of the genes. The list of the conserved male-specific genes and gene families provides a good starting point to dissect the genetic basis of male gametocyte-specific biological processes.  

The second method to identify conserved gene modules using malaria.tools is based on co-expression network clusters. The clusters are used to identify functionally related genes based on the topology of the networks (10), i.e. similar clusters are found by identifying which cluster pairs contain significantly similar $P<0.05$ , hypergeometric test) number of gene families (expressed as Jaccard index, (5)). To exemplify this feature, we clicked first on one of the $P.$ berghei genes found in the table (PBANKA 0102700, https: //malaria.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/sequence/view/17914) and then on the $P.$ berghei co-expression cluster 13 containing this gene (https://malaria.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/cluster/view/40). The ‘Similar clusters’ table found on this page identified $P.$ falciparum cluster 15 as being significantly similar to $P.$ berghei cluster 13 (Jaccard index $=0.246$ . Clicking on the ‘Compare’ button revealed the co-expression networks of the two modules (Figure 2D). As expected, the two conserved clusters show male gametocyte-specific expression profiles (https:// malaria.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/cluster/view/40, https://malaria.sbs. ntu.edu.sg/cluster/view/124), further reinforcing that the two clusters represent a bona fide conserved transcriptional program for male gametocyte-specific motility.  

The analysis of conserved gene modules resulted in 132 genes present in the two conserved clusters, and an inspection of the expression profiles indicated that 123 genes $(93\%)$ showed male gametocyte-specific expression (Supplementary Table S7). However, only 60 of these homologs were annotated and the remaining ones were conserved proteins of unknown function (4 genes) or conserved Plasmodium proteins of unknown function. A closer inspection of the homologs present in the clusters revealed motor proteins such as kinesin (PBANKA 0202700, PF3D7 0111000, PBANKA 0902400, PF3D7 1146700, PBANKA 1458800 and PF3D7 1245600) and dynein (PBANKA 1022400 and PF3D7 1420800) (35), as well as flagella-related proteins such as the radial spoke protein 3 (PBANKA 1039000), growth arrest protein (36) (PBANKA 1455800 and PF3D7 1242400) and MORN repeat containing protein that localizes near the flagellar basal body in male gametocytes (37) (PBANKA 1018200 and PF3D7 1426400). Taken together, the functions of these genes suggest an overall motility and flagella-related function associated with the clusters. Hence, the unannotated genes in these homologous networks will be of prime interest for researchers interested in male gametocyte motility.  

# Identification of microneme-specific co-expressed gene clusters  

Micronemes are protein rich, secretory organelles important for host-cell invasion and gliding motility in parasitic Apicomplexans (38). Proteins are being discharged to facilitate entry of the parasites into red blood cells.  

To gain insight into microneme biogenesis and function using malaria.tools, we entered GO:0020009 (GO term for microneme) to arrive at the page dedicated to microneme cellular component (https://malaria.sbs.ntu.edu. sg/go/view/12866). The page revealed 270 and 299 annotated microneme-associated genes in $P.$ berghei and $P.$ falciparum, respectively. Furthermore, the page contains information about Pfam domains (Prot kinase dom, VWF A, MORN and others) and gene families (OG 01 0000012, OG 01 0000038 and others), which may also play a role in the microneme function. Furthermore, the database identified cluster 2 (https://malaria.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/cluster/view/ 31) and cluster 7 (https://malaria.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/cluster/ view/33) from $P.$ berghei and cluster 2 (https://malaria.sbs. ntu.edu.sg/cluster/view/74) and cluster 12 (https://malaria. sbs.ntu.edu.sg/cluster/view/146) from $P.$ falciparum as being significantly similar $P<0.05$ , Benjamini–Hochenberg corrected $P$ -value) (39) and all clusters were enriched for OG:0020009 (microneme), implicating these clusters in a microneme-specific process.  

To learn more about the function of these four clusters, we investigated their expression profiles. While cluster 2 from $P.$ berghei and cluster 12 from $P.$ falciparum show ubiquitous expression at all life stages of malaria (Figure 3A), cluster 7 from P.berghei and cluster 2 from $P.$ falciparum show ookinete- and sporozoite-specific expression, respectively. Since ookinetes and sporozoites are mosquito stagespecific, we speculate that the two Plasmodium species have at least two types of micronemes, one being ubiquitously expressed (clusters 2 and 12) and another being mosquitospecific (clusters 7 and 2).  

We further investigated the putative function of the ookinete-specific cluster 7 from P. berghei (https://malaria.sbs.ntu.edu.sg/cluster/view/33), and found that the cluster is significantly enriched for GO terms such as entry into host cell (GO:0030260, Supplementary Table S8), which is in line with the microneme being involved in invasion of blood cells. A closer look at the genes found in cluster 7 from $P.$ berghei revealed that it contains genes that are essential for the infectivity and maturation of ookinetes (Figure 3B). Specifically, a group of genes relating to the inner membrane complex, surface ookinete protein and secreted ookinete protein is required for efficient gliding motility and midgut traversal [PBANKA 1354600 (ISC1), PBANKA 1025700 (IMC1l), PBANKA 0513000 (IMC1m) (40), PBANKA 1106900 (PIMMS2) (41), PBANKA 0714300 (HSP20) (42) and PBANKA 1432300 (CeITOS) (43)]. Another group of coexpressed genes contains perforins and a secreted protein, which are known to be important in midgut invasion where the parasite disrupts the membrane of the endothelial cell [PBANKA 0824200 (PLP3), PBANKA 0711400 (PLP4), PBANKA 0711600 (PLP5) (44) and PBANKA 1037800 (SOAP) (45)]. Last but not least, genes important for the transition from the ookinete to oocyst stage are also found enriched in this cluster [PBANKA 0701900 (GAMA/PSOP9) (46), PBANKA 1119200 (PSOP25) (47) and PBANKA 0412900 (CTRP) (48)]. Taken together, cluster 7 from $P.$ berghei contain genes that are most likely important for microneme function and host cell invasion.

# CONCLUSIONS  

The lack of comparative genomic and transcriptomic resources for malaria prompted us to construct malaria.tools, a state-of-the-art database containing a wide range of userfriendly features. The database can be queried by BLAST, gene IDs, keywords, and Pfam domains and Gene Ontology searches. To identify novel genes relevant for a biological process of interest, the co-expression neighbourhoods and clusters can be mined for uncharacterized candidates that are connected to well-studied genes. Alternatively, the database allows an easy identification of genes that are expressed during a specific life stage of the malaria parasite, thus allowing researchers to dissect the transcriptome critical for pathogenicity and other life stages. Finally, the database can compare the clusters and stagespecific expression profiles to identify the conserved core components of various biological processes. We envision that malaria.tools will aid malaria researchers in selecting relevant genes for experimental functional characterization and potential drug development for successful combating the emerging drug resistances.

# ABSTRACT  

Pharmacotranscriptomics has become a powerful approach for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of drugs and discovering new drug targets. Recently, studies of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have increasingly turned to high-throughput transcriptomic screens for molecular effects of herbs/ingredients. And numerous studies have examined gene targets for herbs/ingredients, and link herbs/ingredients to various modern diseases. However, there is currently no systematic database organizing these data for TCM. Therefore, we built HERB, a high-throughput experiment- and reference-guided database of TCM, with its Chinese name as BenCaoZuJian. We re-analyzed 6164 gene expression profiles from 1037 high-throughput experiments evaluating TCM herbs/ingredients, and generated connections between TCM herbs/ingredients and 2837 modern drugs by mapping the comprehensive pharmacotranscriptomics dataset in HERB to CMap, the largest such dataset for modern drugs. Moreover, we manually curated 1241 gene targets and 494 modern diseases for 473 herbs/ingredients from 1966 references published recently, and cross-referenced this novel information to databases containing such data for drugs. Together with database mining and statistical inference, we linked 12 933 targets and 28 212 diseases to 7263 herbs and 49 258 ingredients and provided six pairwise relationships among them in HERB. In summary, HERB will intensively support  

# the modernization of TCM and guide rational modern drug discovery efforts. And it is accessible through http://herb.ac.cn/.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Having a complete understanding of the molecular effects of chemical compounds facilitates strategic selection of candidates for advancement in modern drug discovery (1). To evaluate the molecular effects of active compounds, functional assays using cell lines and animal models are often utilized to study whole-transcriptomic changes by using high-throughput technologies to identify the effects of various treatments or perturbations (2). The largest such database for modern drugs, called Connectivity Map (CMap), includes transcriptomic-level perturbation datasets for thousands of well-annotated small molecules profiled in a core set of nine cell lines (3). Furthermore, there are other similar data available from databases storing functional genomics datasets, e.g. the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository (4). The recent explosion of availability of such transcriptomics perturbation datasets has transformed the field of pharmacology and helped researchers rapidly identify promising chemical compounds for various diseases (5). For example, researchers recently identified a compound, celastrol, which acts as a leptin sensitizer to treat obesity, by mapping the gene expression profile of celastrol to that of reduced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a condition tightly linked to obesity (6). Similarly, withaferin A, another leptin sensitizer for the treatment of obesity, was discovered through a CMap library analysis of those small molecules that have gene expression profiles similar to that of celastrol (7).  

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) provides a rich basis for modern drug discovery and development. To date, 97 FDA-approved drugs have been derived from TCM, as recorded by DrugBank (Supplementary Table S1). For example, ephedrine, which is derived from the TCM herb Ma Huang (Herba ephedrae), is used as an anti-asthmatic drug (8). Similarly, artemisinin (qinghaosu), derived from the Chinese herb qinghao (Herba Artemisiae annuae), is now a first-line drug for malaria (9). The traditional knowledge of Chinese herbs, as well as their combinations as prescriptions, is built upon thousands of years of folk testing, including iteratively identifying natural products with improved clinical efficacy for the treatment of a wide range of diseases. Therefore, isolating the active ingredients in TCM and further dissecting their mechanisms of action provides a promising starting point for new therapeutics (10,11).  

With the advent of next-generation sequencing technology, an increasing number of TCM studies have focused on identifying the molecular effects of active herbs and ingredients using high-throughput techniques (12). For example, microarray and RNA sequencing approaches have been used in TCM research since 2006 and 2011, respectively. Through 2019, there were ${\tt>}6000$ samples in the GEO database on cell lines, animals, or patients that were treated with TCM herbs/ingredients and then analyzed using these transcriptomic technologies. The rapid accumulation of omics data related to natural products has provided new opportunities to understand the transcriptional responses and regulatory changes resulting from the activity of each herb/ingredient (13). Importantly, these data can be mapped to CMap to systematically evaluate the similarities between TCM components and modern drugs, providing objective, data-driven support for the investigation of TCM therapies as candidates for novel therapeutics, such as TCM-HUB (14). However, due to the diversity of data resulting both from varying production platforms and experimental conditions, there is currently no systematic database organizing the data and findings from these high-throughput TCM experiments.  

There have been a large number of studies recently published aiming to decode gene targets of the active components of TCM, and link them to modern diseases. The most recent efforts to curate these references were the HIT (15) and TCMID (16) databases published in 2011 and 2012, respectively. HIT contains 1,301 gene targets related to 586 herbal ingredients gathered from PubMed mining, and TCMID contains 680 herbal targets from Chinese articles mined from the WeiPu database. However, the typical sets of associations between herb-target, herbdisease, and ingredient-disease, have not previously been collected and curated from published references. Curated information is of significantly higher value than previous efforts that indirectly linked them using intermediate components, such as targets. Thus, the bulk of studies published within the last decade required manual curation in order to develop a high-confidence database linking targets, diseases, and TCM herbs/ingredients. Such a system would offer high-quality, evidence-based connections between TCM and modern drugs.  

Therefore, we built HERB (BenCaoZuJian as its Chinese name), a high-throughput experiment- and referenceguided database of TCM. HERB integrates multiple TCM databases and thus contains the most comprehensive list of herbs and ingredients created to date. We gathered and uniformly reanalyzed public data from all available highthroughput experiments (i.e. microarrays and RNA-seq experiments) that tested herbs or their active ingredients. In this manner, we generated a library containing 6164 gene expression profiles from 1037 experiments evaluating herbs or ingredients and built data-driven connections among herbs, active ingredients, and 2837 modern drugs with pharmacotranscriptomics datasets in CMap. Furthermore, we collected 17,886 TCM-related papers that were published since 2011 by PubMed text mining and manually connected 1241 gene targets and 494 modern diseases for 473 herbs/ingredients from 1966 of those references. This newly curated target and disease information for TCM is of high quality due to its manual confirmation, and was crossreferenced to databases for modern drugs, including the TTD (17), DisGeNet (18), HPO (19), and Disease Ontology (20) databases. Together with database mining and statistical inference, we linked 12 933 targets and 28 212 diseases to 7263 herbs and 49 258 ingredients within HERB. The objective, data-based connections between TCM and modern medicines described in HERB provide strong support for further pharmacological studies of TCM as a fundamental arm of modern drug discovery efforts.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Catalogs of TCM herbs and ingredients  

In HERB, we first prepared a list of herbs and ingredients and determined their relationships by integrating multiple TCM databases including SymMap (21), TCMID 2.0 (22), TCMSP 2.3 (23) and TCM-ID (24). To obtain a non-redundant list, we merged herbs/ingredients with the same IDs, names, or aliases. In case of discrepancies across databases, we selected the entry with the most recent publication date. Note that the molecule formula and molecule smile information for all ingredients were standardized according to SciFinder (25) and PubChem (26), two authoritative chemical databases. We then mapped the TCM ingredients to the DrugBank database (27) and labeled a subset of TCM ingredients as approved drugs. Last, we searched an authoritative database of active herbal ingredients, the ‘National Database for Chemical Composition in TCM’ (http://cintmed.cintcm.com/cintmed/), which has been continuously maintained for several decades by the Institute of Information on Traditional Chinese Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences.  

# High-throughput experimental data for TCM herbs and ingredients  

We gathered public data from GEO high-throughput experiments that studied treatments with herbs or ingredients in multiple cell types or animal models. We only retained those datasets that were generated in Homo sapiens or Mus musculus and that were obtained by a typical bulk RNA sequencing platform (Illumina) or microarray studies. Then, we built different pipelines for uniformly reanalyzing RNAseq and microarray data.  

For RNA-seq data, we first downloaded the raw reads in fastq format for each sample (with unique GSM numbers in GEO) using fasterq-dump 2.9.2 (28). Then, we filtered adaptor sequences and low-quality reads by using Trim Galore 0.6.4 (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/ projects/trim galore/) with the parameters ‘–quality $20~\AA-\mathrm{~\}$ length 20 –consider already trimmed $10^{\circ}$ . Next, we mapped the filtered reads to the genome of Homo sapiens (assembly $\mathrm{hg}38$ and annotation v100) or Mus musculus (assembly $\mathrm{mm}10$ and annotation v100) using STAR 2.7.3a (29). Samples with a mapping rate lower than $60\%$ were discarded. Finally, we quantified the read counts for each gene in each sample using featureCounts 2.0.0 (30), preprocessed and quantile-normalized the data into a gene expression matrix using the ‘voom’ function in the R package limma 3.42.2 (31).  

For microarray data, we reanalyzed the samples with raw data provided. We first extracted the probe expression profile from the raw data using R package oligo 1.50.0 (32) for the Affymatrix platform, or using R package limma 3.42.2 (31) for the Agilent platform. Next, we normalized the probe expression profile with the robust multichip average algorithm (rma). For other samples without accessible raw data, we directly used their normalized expression profile for probes. Finally, we transformed the probe profile into the normalized gene expression matrix by systematically constructing the conversion relationships between probes from diverse array platforms to genes. When multiple probes could be converted to the same gene, the probe with the median expression level was selected to represent that gene. To that end, we provide an automatic conversion script named probe2gene, which embeds conversion files in SOFT format for 105 platforms downloaded from NCBI and automatically conducts the probe-to-gene conversion according to the SOFT files.  

# Differential expression analysis and functional enrichment analysis  

We conducted differential expression analysis for each TCM herb/ingredient. First, we manually extracted the comparative relationship between samples. In NCBI-GEO, an experiment with a unique GSE number always contains several samples (with unique GSM numbers), and the samples included control samples as well as samples treated with each herb/ingredient in varying biological/physiological conditions. We defined a comparison as a set of control samples and treatment samples that were performed in the same condition, called an HERB experiment (EXP) hereafter. To ensure reproducibility, we required at least two biological replicates of treatment samples ( $\geq2$ GSMs) in each EXP. As there can be one or many EXPs for each herb/ingredient, we performed downstream analysis individually for each EXP and then merged the analyzed results from multiple EXPs later. Note that data from EXPs performed in Homo sapiens or Mus musculus were merged and displayed separately.  

For each EXP, we performed differential expression analysis using the R package limma 3.42.2. In brief, we first fit linear models from the normalized gene expression matrix using the ‘lmFit’ function and then computed the empirical Bayes statistics using the ‘eBayes’ function. Finally, we selected genes with sufficient expression difference, i.e. $|\mathrm{log}_{2}(\mathrm{fold~change})|\geq0.5\$ and $P\leq0.05$ , as differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Based on the DEG list for each EXP, we conducted further functional enrichment analysis for each EXP using the R package clusterProfiler 3.14.3 (33). We used the ‘enrichGO’ function for GO enrichment and the ‘enrichKEGG’ function for KEGG enrichment. Enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways were selected when $P\leq0.05$ . Of note, we conducted separate GO/KEGG analyses in each EXP for all genes, up-regulated genes, and down-regulated genes, respectively.  

Then, we merged the analyzed results for each herb/ingredient that had multiple EXPs. We firstly transformed the initial two-tailed $\mathrm{\bfP}$ -values for EXPs to two one-tailed $P$ -values, $P/2$ and $1-P/2$ , for considering up-regulation and down-regulation. Then, we merged two unified probabilities for each gene, one for up-regulation $(P{-}u p)$ , and the other for down-regulation ( $P$ -down) using Fisher’s method (34). The test statistic $(X^{2})$ following a chi-square distribution is shown below.  

$$
\chi^{2}=-2\sum_{\mathrm{i}=1}^{k}\ln(p_{i})
$$  

We used the ‘fisher.method’ function in the $\mathrm{~\bf~R~}$ package metaseqR (35) to compute the statistics and the corresponding $P$ -values. Genes with only one significant $P$ -value (either $P-u p<0.05$ or $P$ -down $<0.05$ ) were retained in the DEG list, and the directions of their dysregulations were determined by assessing which $P-$ -value was significant. Similarly, we also required an average $|\mathrm{log}_{2}(\mathrm{fold~change})|\geq0.5\$ based on those EXPs with significant differences in the individual tests. Based on the merged set of differentially expressed genes for each herb/ingredient, we performed separate GO and KEGG enrichment analyses for all, up and down-regulated genes, respectively. Furthermore, we adjusted up and down $P$ -values separately to account for false discovery rates (FDRs) using the BH method (36).  

# Data-driven mapping of TCM herbs/ingredients with modern drugs  

Once we established the gene expression profiles for TCM herbs/ingredients, we further evaluated the similarities between TCM herbs/ingredients and modern drugs by mapping HERB-EXP to CMap, which contains pharmacotranscriptomics datasets for thousands of well-annotated small molecules. We thus built the data-driven connections by first mapping the DEG list derived from each EXP to CMap and then merged the mapped results from all EXPs from a given herb or ingredient. Note that data from EXPs performed in $H.$ . sapiens or M. musculus were mapped and displayed separately.  

For each EXP, the list of differentially expressed genes was submitted to the CMap website (https://clue.io/query) in batch query mode. Of note, a maximum of the top 300 genes in the DEG list were retained (5). It is noteworthy that the DEG genes from mouse EXPs were firstly converted to their human orthologs by using the R package homologene with the conversion table from NCBI (ftp://ftp.ncbi. nih.gov/pub/HomoloGene/build68/) (Supplementary Table  

S2), and then the human genes for each mouse EXP were submitted for CMap calculation. The CMap dataset we queried, called Touchstone, consisted of perturbation data for 2837 compounds that were tested in nine cell lines. Using the connectivity map method (3), the similarities between the input DEG list and the gene expression profiles for all these 2837 perturbagens were evaluated and ranked by their connectivity map scores, $\tau$ , ranked from $-100$ to 100. A $\tau$ of $+90/-90$ indicates that only $10\%$ of random perturbations showed stronger connectivity to the input DEG list, and ‘plus’ or ‘minus’ represents a positive or negative correlation, respectively.  

Then, we merged the connectivity results for each herb/ingredient with multiple EXPs. We followed the method of maximum quantile statistic in CMap (3) to merge the connectivity map scores derived from each comparison (EXP). The summarized connectivity map score for each herb/ingredient was calculated according to the following formula,

\begin{array}{r}{{\mathrm S c o r e}_{h,p}=\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{Q_{\mathrm{high}}(s c o r e_{e,h,p})}&{\mathrm{if}|Q_{\mathrm{high}}(s c o r e_{e,h,p})|\geq|Q_{\mathrm{low}}(s c o r e_{e,h,p})|}\\ {Q_{\mathrm{low}}(s c o r e_{e,h,p})}&{o t h e r w i s e}\end{array}\right.}\end{array}
$$  

where the final $s c o r e_{h,p}$ stands for the overall similarity measure between a herb/ingredient $h$ in HERB and a perturbagen $p$ in the CMap database, and the $\mathrm{score}_{e,h,p}$ indicates the individual similarity measure between each EXP $e$ related to the herb/ingredient $h$ and the perturbagen $p$ . This procedure compares the $Q_{h i g h}$ and $Q_{l o w}$ quantiles of score $e,h,p$ and retains whichever is of higher absolute magnitude. The scores of $Q_{h i g h}$ and $\boldsymbol{Q_{l o w}}$ were set to be 0.67 and 0.33 respectively, as suggested by CMap.  

# Manually curated reference data for TCM herbs and ingredients  

We collected TCM-related papers from 2011 to 2020 through PubMed text mining. The names and aliases of herbs and ingredients were used as key words, and the key words were required to be present in the title or abstract. In order to narrow down the initial paper set, we first required that references should be published in journals with an impact factor above five according to the Journal Citation Report 2019, and we only selected from articles classified in the biomedical-related categories according to the classification system of the National Science Library, Chinese Academy of Sciences (http://www.fenqubiao.com/). Then, we restricted our search to research articles that were not labeled as review papers in PubMed. Third, we only kept those papers that were related to active herbal ingredients that were included in the National Database for Chemical Composition in TCM (see the first section in Materials and Methods). After PubMed mining and hierarchical filtering, we obtained a list of 17 886 references for manual curation.  

Ten Ph.D. candidates were recruited to read, select, and extract information from this set of $17~886$ references, with senior students performing a secondary verification. This effort resulted in a set of usable information on gene targets and diseases related to TCM herbs/ingredients from 1966 of these references, called HERB-REF, most of which had evidence from low-throughput experiments. Thus, the resulting data included information not only on herb/ingredient and target/disease relationships, but also on the cell line, animal model, or patients used in the experiments. We further standardized gene names for the newly curated TCM targets according to the NCBI nomenclature and GeneCards database (37), and then cross-referenced them with the TTD database (17), a widely used therapeutic target database for modern compounds. Then, we standardized the disease information to MeSH terms (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html) and the DisGeNet database (18), and cross-referenced them with the HPO and Disease Ontology (20) databases. Further, we curated a number of clinically relevant phenotypes in HERB-REF for users’ convenience. Finally, we transferred the relationships between targets and diseases from DisGeNet (18) to HERB. As a result of this approach, HERB offers a set of data-based connections linking TCM and modern drugs, built on basis of high-quality manual curation of references.  

# Other associations among HERB components  

Prior to HERB-REF, databases like SymMap (21), HIT (15), TCMSP (23) and TCMID (22) have also curated ingredient-target relationships. Therefore, we merged together the ingredient target pairs from reference and database mining. Other relationships, e.g. ingredient disease, herb target and herb disease, were generally indirectly linked by combining two or more direct relationships. For example, the indirect relationship between ingredient and disease can be obtained using the gene targets as a middle component (Supplementary Figure S1A). As HERB contains the most comprehensive list of herbs and targets, we calculated the indirect associations for these three relationships again using Fisher’s exact test, which is called statistical inference and adopted from SymMap. Taking the ingredient-disease relationship as an example, we first acquired all indirect associations by linking ingredient-target and target-disease relationships together and then selected reliable associations $(\mathrm{FDR}<0.01)$ from them using Fisher’s exact test followed by multiple test corrections using the BH method (36). This strategy was also used to infer the herb−target and herb−disease relationships by using ingredient and target as the middle components, respectively (Supplementary Figures S1B, C). Finally, we combined the associated pairs from statistical inference and reference mining together.  

# Implementation of HERB  

In summary, HERB provides information about herbs, ingredients, their gene targets, diseases in modern terms, and the relevant high-throughput experimental data and manually curated references. HERB provides a convenient web interface for users to browse, search, visualize, and download data. HERB is freely accessible at http://herb.ac.cn without a need for user registration. The HERB website was built using the Python-Flask, Nginx and React JavaScript frameworks and is compatible with most major browsers. The HERB data are stored in a MySQL database.

# RESULTS  

# Data contents in HERB  

HERB contains a comprehensive list of TCM herbs (7263) and ingredients (49 258) by integrating multiple TCM databases. HERB was created through reanalysis of 6164 gene expression profiles from 1037 high-throughput experiments of herbs/ingredients and a collection of 1966 TCMrelated references, from which 1241 gene targets and 494 modern diseases for 473 herbs/ingredients, as well as 709 clinical-relevant phenotypes were curated. Further, HERB includes information on targets and diseases gathered by database mining and statistical inference, resulting in a final total of $12933$ targets and 28 212 diseases related to herbs and ingredients. These data statistics are shown in Table 1. We also provided the statistics of six pairwise relationships among herbs, ingredients, targets, and diseases that were gathered from reference mining, database mining, and/or indirect association through statistical inference (Supplementary Table S3). HERB contains two important novel features lacking from previous TCM databases. First, HERB presents a comprehensive pharmacotranscriptomics data set for TCM herbs and ingredients, allowing mapping to modern drugs with data in CMap. Second, HERB provides manually curated data of targets and diseases mined from recent literature, providing high-confidence information for ranking TCM herbs and ingredients as promising candidates for therapeutic development.  

# High-throughput data analyzed in HERB  

Through GEO mining using herbs and ingredients as key words, we gathered 472 high-throughput GEO datasets containing 6164 GEO samples. Each GEO dataset performed by a specific lab had a unique GSE number. Each GEO sample conducted in a particular biological/physiological condition also had a unique GSM number. We manually obtained the herb/ingredient-centric classification of these data by defining a HERB experiment (EXP), as a set of control and treatment GEO samples related to a herb/ingredient in one GEO dataset. This resulted in 1037 EXPs in HERB, with $83.9\%$ of them consisting of microarray data and the remaining $16.1\%$ as RNA-seq data; $10.4\%$ of HERB-EXPs are related to herbs and $89.6\%$ of them are related to ingredients (Figure 1A-1). The average number of biological replicates for control and treatment samples in HERB-EXPs were $4.0\pm2.9$ and 3.7 $\pm2.6$ respectively. Of note, $83.2\%$ and $74.1\%$ of control and treatment samples had at least three replicates, respectively (Figure 1A-2). Sufficient numbers of replicates facilitate downstream analysis of these high-throughput data.

Figure 1. Construction and characterization of HERB-EXP. (A) A schematic diagram of the data processing framework in HERB-EXP in four consecutive steps: 1. download data from GEO experiments (GSE) and samples (GSM), extract HERB experiments (EXP) for each herb/ingredient, and show the number of GSE/GSM/EXPs for each data type in bar plots. 2. For each EXP, illustrate the number of biological replicates for control and treatment samples in violin plots. 3. Automatically analyze RNA-seq and microarray data according to different pipelines for each EXP first, and then merge results from multiple EXPs together for each herb/ingredient. 4. Visualize the results of differential expression analysis, GO and KEGG enrichment, or CMap connectivity for each EXP, and then for each herb/ingredient, in volcano plot, bar plot, dot plot or network respectively. (B) The differential expression of four known targets (CDKN1A, DES, TNFRSF10B and DDIT3) for four TCM ingredients (curcumin, resveratrol, rotenone, and thapsigargin) in multiple EXPs related to these ingredients are shown in volcano plots. The X-axis shows the expression change compared to control samples and the Y-axis shows statistical significance. The four colors correspond to four target-ingredient pairs, and the two shapes indicate the species information for each EXP (mouse/human). (C) Classification of all herbs/ingredients with HERBEXP data, according to their mapped compounds in CMap.  

Then, we built automatic pipelines to analyze the microarray and RNA-seq data of each individual EXP (Figure 1A-3). To process the RNA-seq data, we used raw data as an input, mapped the filtered reads to the genome, and got the normalized read count for each gene. For microarray raw data, we first processed the data into a probe profile and then converted it into normalized gene expression data. If no raw data were available, the former step was skipped. Based on the normalized gene expression matrix for control and treatment samples in each EXP, we identified DEGs for each EXP and then merged the results into a ranked DEG list for each herb/ingredient. We visualized the DEG list for herbs and ingredients by volcano plot (Figure 1A-4). Based on the DEG list, we visualized the enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways in bar plots and dot plots, for all, up and down-regulated genes (Figure 1A-4), respectively. Moreover, we queried the CMap data containing pharmacotranscriptomics datasets for 2837 modern drugs while using the DEG lists of each herb/ingredient as the query. The connections between the TCM herb/ingredienst and their map-able modern drugs were visualized with a interactive network (Figure 1A-4).  

In summary, there were an average of 1801 DEGs upon EXP-level analysis (Supplementary Figure S2A) and 2864 DEGs, on average, for herbs/ingredients after merging the results from multiple EXPs (Supplementary Figure S2B). For GO terms, the average numbers were 1083 and 1260 for the EXP-level and herb/ingredient-level results (Supplementary Figure S3). For KEGG pathways, the two numbers were 44 and 50, respectively (Supplementary Figure S4). We also illustrated the GO/KEGG enrichment results for upregulated and down-regulated genes (Supplementary Figures S3 and S4). Next, we selected all DEGs related to TCM ingredients that were described in previously published papers and explored their expression changes in the HERB experiments. Across 325 such ingredient-target pairs, 208 of them $(64\%)$ showed consistent patterns of differential expression (Supplementary Table S4). Other inconsistencies may be caused by post-transcriptional regulation issues, as evidences from references are mainly based on protein expression levels. We also showed 4 distinguished ingredientgene pairs in Figure 1B. The direction of regulation for them, including the curcumin-CDKN1A (38), resveratrolDES (39), rotenone-TNFRSF10B (40) and thapsigarginDDIT3 (41), were the same as identified in their corresponding references, and cross-validated by both human and mouse data that are merged separately. Thus, they are most likely to be the bona fide targets that are highly related to the downstream pathways affected by these ingredients.  

Next, we connected TCM herbs and ingredients to modern pharmaceutic compounds using connectivity mapping between HERB-EXP data and CMap data. In total, 20 herbs and 152 ingredients could be mapped to 978 CMap compounds using a cutoff of absolute connectivity score above 95. The clinical status for 383 out of 978 CMap compounds could be classified as approved drugs, investigational drugs, experimental drugs, or other compounds, by connecting their IDs (InChiKey or PubChem ID) documented in CMap to DrugBank. Thus, we further classified herbs/ingredients according to the type of compounds to which they were mapped. Out of 247 herbs/ingredient with high-throughput data in HERB, there were 136 $(55.1\%)$ herbs and ingredients that could be mapped to approved drugs. Another 9 $(3.6\%)$ and 8 $(3.2\%)$ herbs/ingredients could be mapped to investigational drugs that were in clinical trials and experimental drugs that were under preclinical research, respectively (Figure 1C). Taken together, the gene expression patterns for $560\%$ of herbs/ingredients were similar or antagonistic to modern drugs. These findings illustrate the potential for other TCM herbs/ingredients to be investigated in pharmaceutic development. We have provided a detailed list of the mapped drugs for the TCM herbs/ingredients in Supplementary Table S5. Note that for mouse EXP, a total of 15 123 mouse DEG genes can be converted to their human orthologs, from which 15 060 mouse genes were converted in a one-versus-one manner. On average, $65.3\%$ of mouse DEG genes in these EXPs can be mapped (Supplementary Figure S5). As a result, the CMap mapping results based on mouse data maybe incomplete. So the mouse data was just provided as an auxiliary information.

Figure 2. Overview of HERB-REF. (A) Statistics on the number of herb/ingredient-related references published in each year. The blue line represents the total references from manual curation, and the red line represents the references with curated targets/diseases. (B) The number of curated herbs/ingredients, targets/diseases, and their associations from HERB-REF are shown in bar plots, with the four facets showing four types of associations: herb-target, herb-disease, ingredient–target, and ingredient–disease. (C) HERB-REF datasets were used to search and rank promising herbs or ingredients for cancer-related diseases that could be connected to immuno-oncology related targets. The number of herbs/ingredients obtained by target-based search and/or disease-based search was shown in a Venn plot. (D) The selected herbs/ingredients that were supported by both target-based and disease-based search were illustrated in a dot plot, with the $X\mathrm{-}$ and Y-axis showing the number of references from each search, respectively. The density of dots representing the number of dots at the same point are represented in color scales.  

# References curated in HERB  

We collected TCM-related papers from 2011 to 2020 by PubMed text mining and obtained a list of $17~886$ references for manual curation after hierarchical filtering (Figure 2A, blue line). The number of published papers related to TCM herbs/ingredients has increased dramatically in the past three years, with 2905 relevant papers published in 2019 at the top (with partial data for 2020). After manually reading, selecting, and extracting information from the initial 17 886 references, 1966 references were selected, from which we collected a large amount of highquality data on gene targets and modern diseases for TCM herbs/ingredients. The pattern of the final set of references with curated targets/diseases (Figure 2A, red line) was quite similar with the initial set of references under manual curation (Figure 2A, blue line), suggesting that the process of manual curation by $10~\mathrm{Ph.D}$ . candidates was unbiased. Only $10.9\%$ of the initial set of references were selected, because we carefully filtered out a large number of references without relevant or reliable information. Finally, we manually extracted 1241 gene targets of 39 herbs and 370 ingredients and manually connected 494 modern diseases with 40 herbs and 354 active ingredients (Figure 2B). The number of newly curated targets was similar to that of HIT 2011 (1301), and larger than TCMID 2012 (680), demonstrating that a continuous number of recent TCM studies have focused on molecular and mechanistic studies. This new set of curated disease information included direct experimental data, and is thus likely of external validity than prior approaches that indirectly linked herbs/ingredients to diseases using gene targets as intermediates. Further, 709 clinically relevant phenotypes, although not diseases themself, were curated and presented for users’ convenience.  

Next, we ranked herbs or ingredients that were promising for a particular disease with a set of candidate targets, based on the newly curated HERB-REF data. For example, as TCM has been shown to have clinical benefits for regulating the immunity of cancer patients (42), we used the targets and diseases related to immuno-oncology as the input to query HERB-REF. We first collected a list of 400 target genes related to immuno-oncology, according to external published papers (43–45). Then, we searched the 1,966 references in HERB-REF for 53 cancer-related diseases using the key words ‘neoplasm’, ‘tumor’, ‘cancer’ or ‘carcinoma’. We intersected the two lists with the target-related or disease-related herbs or ingredients (Figure 2C). This resulted in 282 herbs/ingredients that had targets in the immuno-oncology related list and were supported by 745 of the references in HERB-REF, and obtained 178 herbs/ingredients that could be connected to immuno-oncology related diseases and supported by 396 references. When we required both target and disease relationships, we were left with a final list of 9 herbs and 137 ingredients that were highly related to immuno-oncology. The list of 146 herbs/ingredients is provided in Supplementary Table S6.  

We further visualized the 146 herbs/ingredients related to immuno-oncology in Figure 2D. Most of these herbs/ingredients were supported by a small number of references from either target-based search or disease-based search, as indicated by the high density of dots in the bottom-left corner. The dots in the upper-right corner represent higher confidence estimates with large numbers of supporting references. For example, curcumin, an active ingredient produced by the Curcuma longa plant, inhibits the COP9 signalosome 5 (CSN5) and diminishes the expression of PD-L1 in cancer cells, which is a well-known target for cancer immune therapies (46). As a result, curcumin may represent a promising candidate for combination therapy in cancer. In our HERB-REF search, the connection of curcumin to immuno-oncology was supported by 65 references, with 51 target-based references, 22 disease-based references, and 8 references from both searches, demonstrating the power of HERB-REF for searching and ranking TCM solutions for a given disease. Cannabidiol, a phytocannabinoid from cannabis plants, has long been shown to have anti-tumor activity (47). In both cell lines and an animal model of triple-negative breast cancer, cannabidiol significantly inhibits epidermal growth factor (EGF)- induced proliferation and inhibits the recruitment of tumorassociated macrophages (47). In HERB-REF, cannabidiol was supported by $6/17/4$ references from only targetbased search, disease-based search, and both searches, respectively.

Figure 3. An illustration of an HERB search. (A) The search page of HERB shows the main 4 components of HERB, including herbs, ingredients, targets, and diseases. (B) The experiment page of HERB shows all high-throughput data related to herbs/ingredients and analyzed by HERB. (C) The reference page of HERB shows all published references with curated targets/diseases information for herbs/ingredients. (D) The details page for an example ingredient, triptolide. The summary panel comes first, and shows relevant descriptive information for this ingredient. The following panels show the herbs, gene targets, and diseases related to this ingredient, respectively. Users can click on the tabs in each panel to navigate information from different data sources. (E) The subsequent detailed page for triptolide. Four figures were used to visualize the high-throughput data related to triptolide. For example, the DEGs are shown in a volcano plot (upper-left). The enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways are shown in bar plot and dot plot (lower-left and upper-right). The connectivity between triptolide and its related compounds in CMap are shown in a network. Note that all figures are implemented in an interactive way where users can see the details of each dot/bar/node/edge upon mousing over them.  

Aside from reference mining, we merged 157 722 ingredient-target pairs related to 7781 ingredients and 12 838 gene targets from previous TCM databases, including SymMap, HIT, TCMSP and TCMID. We statistically inferred the indirect relationships between ingredient-disease, herb-target, and herb-disease (Supplementary Table S3). The number of each component and their relationships, based on different cutoffs, are shown in Supplementary Figure S6. As a result, we ultimately linked 12 933 targets and 28 212 diseases to 7263 herbs and 49 258 ingredients to obtain HERB, the most comprehensive database for TCM available to date.  

# Using the HERB database  

HERB is freely accessible at http://herb.ac.cn. It provides browse and search pages for users to navigate herbs, ingredients, targets, and diseases. Examples and the types of searchable keywords are shown in or below the search menu for each component (Figure 3A). For the two novel features added in HERB, experiments and references, we provide additional browsing and searching pages. In the experiment search page (Figure 3B), users can click on an experiment ID to view the details page for each EXP. Descriptive information about each EXP includes experimental subjects, experimental conditions, administration methods, sample information for treatment groups and control groups, etc. These descriptions can be found in both the search page and detailed page of each EXP. The analyzed results of EXPlevel, high-throughput data are shown in the details page of experiments in the same format as herbs/ingredients, which are described in the following paragraph. In the reference search page (Figure 3C), users can click on the reference ID to view the detail page for each REF. Details of references shown in the browse and details page include the journal name, publication date, experimental subjects, experimental type, and PubMed ID. In the detailed page, we show the pairing relationships between herbs/ingredients and targets/diseases that were manually curated from each corresponding reference. Furthermore, we visualized the abstract for each reference by using a word cloud.  

The detail page for an example ingredient, triptolide, is shown in Figure 3D and E. The first section includes descriptive information about triptolide and its related herbs, gene targets, and diseases (Figure 3D). The summary information includes the ingredient name, alias, formula, molecule SMILES, molecular weight, and external IDs from other databases. Related herbs for triptolide were integrated from multiple TCM databases. The related targets and diseases for triptolide were derived from reference mining, database mining, or statistical inference, which are each displayed separately under different subpages. And help information about the data source is shown for each table. Among these, the records from reference mining, i.e. manual curation, give the highest-confidence data and can be cross-referenced into the reference page of HERB. The records from database mining are also of high quality, with the original database name and links provided. The significance of the records from statistical inference, i.e. Fisher’s exact, is provided, in both P-values and FDRs followed by BH adjustment.  

The high-throughput data analyzed by HERB is visualized in both tables and plots. Users can rank and filter records according to each column in all tables. We introduced four figures in the website to better visualize the data in these tables, with each representing an important aspect of the high-throughput data (Figure 3E). Note that human and mouse data are displayed separately, and users can navigate between the two datasets using drop-down menus. For example, the first volcano plot, shown in the upper left, visualizes the DEGs related to triptolide, which has been merged from multiple EXPs of triptolide. One dot in this figure represents a gene, with the color indicating the direction (up or down) of its dysregulation, and the size is proportional to the number of EXPs that support the gene as a DEG. The bar plot shown in the lower left and the dot plot shown in the upper right show the enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways. Each term in the underlying tables can be linked back to the GO and KEGG pages (48– 50). Moreover, drop-down menus were provided for users to navigate GO/KEGG results for all, up, and down-regulated genes. The three colors in the GO figure represents three types of GO terms, molecular function (MF), cellular component (CC), and biological process (BP). The size of dots in the KEGG figures indicates the number of EXPs that support that particular item. Detailed information for each bar or dot are visible when the mouse is moved over the element. The last figure in the lower right is a network showing the modern compounds (in CMap) that are mappable to triptolide. The node in the center is triptolide. Other nodes around it are related compounds in four different colors that stand for the data type of the CMap perturbation, including compound (CP), perturbational Class (PCL), gene overexpression (OE), gene knock-down (KD). Furthermore, we embedded a pie chart in each surrounding node to show the specific EXPs that support its mapping to triptolide. Edges between triptolide and its mapped compounds are shown in two colors, with red for a positive correlation and blue for a negative correlation between gene expression profiles. The widths of the edges are proportional to the absolute value of connectivity score. By default, we visualized mapped results with an absolute connectivity score ${>}95$ . Users are free to select different cutoffs and subsets of the data types of CMap to focus on specific data of interest. And users can use the zoom in/out buttons at the upper-left to control the connectivity figure.  

# DISCUSSION  

Transcriptome analysis allows quantitative measurements of the transcriptional responses and regulatory changes resulting from the perturbations due to compounds, making it a powerful approach for discovering drug targets, evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of drugs, and revealing possible side effects. In recent years, high-throughput data from laboratory or clinical studies of TCM herbs and ingredients have quickly accumulated, but to date there has been no good system of organization. Besides, new TCM-related references published within the last decade have not been curated. As a result, in this work, we reanalyzed all available microarray and RNA-seq data for TCM herbs/ingredients, and curated high-confidence targets and diseases information from recently published TCM references. Together with database mining and statistical inference, we ultimately built HERB, the most comprehensive database for TCM available to date.  

The novelty of the HERB database includes: (i) HERB provides a comprehensive and unified pharmacotranscriptomics database of TCM, by reanalyzing all available high-throughput experiments for TCM. Using HERB, researchers and drug developers can view primary data as well as the data-driven mapping results between TCM herbs/ingredients and modern compounds, allowing easy exploration of potential mechanism of actions for herbs/ingredients as well as the identification of new potentially effective therapeutics. (ii) HERB gives highconfidence targets and diseases information related TCM herbs/ingredients based on manual curation of novel references published within the last decade, which bridging the large gap since the creation of HIT (2011) and TCMID (2012). Using these newly curated references in HERB, users can easily search and rank promising herbs or ingredients for a disease with a set of candidate targets. We believe this intuitive workflow will help researchers make use of the significant volume of published data related to TCM. (iii) HERB provides the most comprehensive list of herbs, ingredients, targets, and diseases by integrating multiple data resources. Further, HERB gives comprehensive pairwise relationships among them by combing diverse strategies including database mining, reference mining, and statistical inference.  

HERB provides a convenient web interface for users to browse, search, visualize and download key information, and we believed that HERB will intensively support the modernization of TCM to guide drug discovery efforts. However, the currently available data set for TCM pharmacotranscriptomics is remain insufficient, not only in the number of data sets, but also in the diversity of sequencing technologies. In the future, we plan to continuously add as much data as possible. In particular, we would like to add new types of data, such as proteomic, metabolomic, and meta-genomic datasets, to HERB for further improvements. With more and diverse data becoming available, further studies based on these data will be required for analyzing the gene regulation networks under the herb/ingredient perturbation (51,52), and identifying new types of diseaserelevant genes (53,54). In a word, we plan to continuously improve the HERB database to provide a high-quality resource for the field of TCM big data.

# Abstract  

Rodents represent the most abundant order of mammals, exhibiting remarkable diversity in morphology, habitats, behaviors, and hosted pathogens. Significant attention is currently focused on rodents as experimental animals for biomedical research. However, numerous aspects of rodents remain unexplored, such as their potential in unconventional biomedical models, molecular underpinnings of intriguing complex phenotypes, adaptations to environment or climate change, and host-pathogen interactions and arms race evolution. These challenges require a systematic framework to integrate the genomic variations among rodents with information on rodent-borne pathogens. To address this gap, we have established a comprehensive, freely accessible, and user-friendly atlas named Rodent Genome and Pathogen multi-Omics (RodentGPOmics), which provides comparative analysis of rodent genomes and information on zoonotic pathogen sequences in rodents. The RodentGPOmics Atlas provides: (i) basic information on 2706 rodent species; (ii) chromosome-level visualization of genomes, functional annotations, and genomic comparisons across 121 rodent species; (iii) epidemiological profiles based on 21 852 pathogen sequences reported in rodents and (iv) a few genomic tools for in-depth exploration of rodent multi-omics. This resource aims to advance the development of biomedical models for humans for promoting public health, as well as innovate the genetics, genomics, and molecular evolution in rodents, and offer valuable knowledge on rodent-borne emerging/ e-emerging zoonotic infectious diseases. The resources are freely available and easy o-use at http://RodentGPOmics.njau.edu.cn:8888/Rodent/ ndex/homePage

# Introduction  

Rodents (order Rodentia  are the most diverse and widely distributed group of mammals, comprising at least 30 families and ${>}2000$ species. They exhibit remarkable diversity in morphology functionality habitat ecotypes (such as prairies, deserts, forests, and semi-aquatic environments), geographical distributions, dietary preferences (e.g. grasses, bamboo), social behaviors and susceptibility to infection of zoonotic emerging pathogens (1–10 . Currently, there is significant focus on using rodents, particularly mice and rats, as experimental animals for biomedical research including drug development and their biological validation. However, many aspects of rodents that could be used to address major questions in biology, medicine, and evolution remain unexplored. These include: (i) their species-specific potential as unconventional disease models for studying longevity, aging, regeneration and behavioral neuroscience (2 11 ; (ii) the genetic similarities enabling their use as models for studying human diseases (12 ; (iii) the molecular mechanisms behind intriguing phenotypes such as circadian rhythms, hibernation, low metabolic rate and regeneration; (iv) their adaptations to extreme environments (e.g. high elevation, semi-aquatic lifestyles, temperature extremes, hypoxia, dehydration) and responses to climate change; (v) their potential to reveal novel evolutionary patterns, such as allopatric speciation and sex determination (9  and (vi) their role in the evolutionary arms race with pathogens and the spillover risks (i.e. the potential for rodent pathogens to transfer from animals to humans) associated with being natural reservoirs for numerous pathogens responsible for severe zoonotic diseases. t has been estimated that rodents asymptomatically harbor over $60\%$ of known zoonotic pathogens, ncluding viruses rom amilies Arenaviridae Coronaviridae Henipaviridae Filoviridae and Hantaviridae  that have a substantial impact on public health (13–16 . To address hese challenges, t s crucial o establish a comprehensive framework for investigating genomic divergence and the abundance, heterogeneity, and spillover risks of circulating pathogens—areas that currently remain largely unexplored.  

In this study, we have established the RodentGPOmics Atlas, a pioneering resource that provides detailed insights into rodent comparative genomics and zoonotic pathogens, harbored by rodents. This atlas is designed to facilitate the development of advanced models applicable also for biomedical studies, elucidate the molecular mechanisms and evolutionary dynamics of complex traits, adaptations, and host-pathogen interactions in rodents. By innovating in rodent genetics and genomics, the RodentGPOmics Atlas aims to offer valuable knowledge, which can aid n predicting and mitigating he risk of zoonotic pathogen transmission.  

# Materials and methods  

# Data acquisition, proofreading and curation  

To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the biological characteristics and habitat ecotypes of diverse rodent species, we have employed advanced web scraping techniques to compile fundamental data on 2706 rodent species across 35 families. This dataset includes detailed information on image features, taxonomic classifications, geographical distributions, and habitat environments, sourced from prestigious databases such as the IUCN Red List (https://www. iucnredlist.org  and GBIF (https://www.gbif.org/zh/ . Additionally, we have collected chromosome-level genomic sequences for 121 rodent species, representing 29 families and 78 genera, from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Genome database (https://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/datasets/genome/ . This genomic data encompasses genome sequences, comprehensive annotation files, and transcriptomic information. Moreover, our study incorporates metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and amplicon datasets retrieved rom he NCBI’s GenBank database 17 and he European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) database of the EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) (18 , including 1143 viromes rom 108 rodent species across 14 countries and 2923 16S rRNA gene amplicons.  

# In-depth analysis of multi-omics data  

In rodent genomes, repetitive sequences were meticulously annotated through homologous comparisons, leveraging the comprehensive RepBase database (http://www.girinst.org/ server/RepBase/ ndex.php . Subsequent genome masking was executed utilizing the RepeatMasker software (19 . For gene prediction, he AUGUSTUS software, which employs he Hidden Markov Model (HMM) prediction method, was applied (20 , where the autoAugTrain.pl script was trained using precisely annotated mouse genome (Mus musculus GCF_000001635.27). To establish a robust gene function annotation database, sequence correspondence data from six major biological function databases—Non-Redundant (NR) (21 , Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (22 , Gene Ontology (GO) (23 24 , Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG) (25 , Swiss-Prot (26 , and Pfam (27 —were systematically downloaded and integrated. Functional annotation of predicted rodent genes was further refined through homologous comparison against this curated database using Diamond software 28 . Orthogroup genes, encompassing both orthologous and paralogous genes, as well as gene families and duplications, were delineated across 31 high-quality assembled rodent genomes using OrthoFinder software (29 . Additionally, pairwise comparative genomic collinearity analyses among these 31 rodent genomes were conducted with MCScanX software (30 .  

For the analysis of 16S amplicon libraries, the Fastp software was utilized to rigorously evaluate the overall quality of the downloaded data, systematically removing sequences of vectors and low-quality bases to yield clean reads (31 . The data were categorized into single-ended and paired-end sequences. Single-ended reads were directly employed or subsequent analyses, whereas paired-end reads were first merged using FLASH software to facilitate comprehensive downstream processing (32 . Subsequent quality control, sequence trimming, and amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) profiling were conducted using the DADA2 tool (33 . To ensure accuracy, stringent criteria were applied during trimming and filtering, including setting the maximum expected error rate to 1 $\left(\mathrm{maxEE}=1\right)$ ) and discarding sequences shorter than 150 bp, thereby minimizing the likelihood of false positive annotations. The localized Greengenes 16S database (34  was selected as the reference for feature sequence annotation, with results obtained using the default parameters of the QIIME2 tool (35 .  

For each metagenomic or metatranscriptomic library, the Fastp software was utilized to conduct rigorous quality control, including the assessment of sequencing read length, removal of sequencing adapters and filtering of low-quality bases. The resultant clean reads were then de novo assembled using MEGAHIT software with default parameters (36 . The assembled contig dataset was subsequently queried against he NCBI NR Protein Database using the Diamond blastx tool (28  with an $E$ value threshold of 0.001, ensuring both high sensitivity and minimal false positive rates. Taxonomic classifications or he op blast hits of each contig were obtained or potential viral annotation. The datasets and pipelines nvolved in this study are summarized in Figure 1A and 1B.

This atlas is designed to enhance the development of biomedical models while promoting public health, drive innovation in rodent genetics, genomics, and molecular evolution, and provide critical insights into rodent-borne emerging/re-emerging zoonotic infectious diseases.  

# The fundamental biological and environmental features of rodent species  

The RodentGPOmics Atlas provides an extensive compendium of fundamental biological and environmental characteristics for 2706 rodent species. This comprehensive dataset includes detailed taxonomic classifications, imagery, geographical distributions, altitudinal ranges, habitat types, and life-history related traits such as generation time. The 2706 species span 35 families and 534 genera, inhabiting diverse environments including wetlands, deserts, shrublands, savannas, grasslands, and forests. Their generation times range from $^{<1}$ year to up to 9 years, and they occupy altitudes from sea level to 6000 meters. This repository represents a state-of-the-art resource for understanding the biological and environmental attributes of rodent species, offering insights into their evolutionary trajectories and potential ecological drivers.  

# The comparative genomics of rodent species  

To date, sequencing efforts have encompassed 121 rodent species spanning 29 families and 78 genera. However, most of these sequences are raw nucleotide data deposited in the NCBI’s Genome database, acking comprehensive annotations and hus imiting heir research potential. Addressing his imitation, the RodentGPOmics Atlas provides a detailed visualization and curation of these genomes, which vary in chromosome number, through the JBrowse 2 genome browser (37 . This resource provides thorough annotations of genes, transcriptional profiles, and functional descriptions for all 121 rodent species, significantly facilitating enhanced exploration and analysis of rodent genomic data.

Drawing on the 121 rodent genomes, the RodentGPOmics Atlas provides an in-depth analysis of comparative genomic features. A comprehensive pan-genomic set has been meticulously developed, encompassing 36 721 gene orthogroups, including both orthologous and paralogous genes, along with $19\ 522$ gene expansion events and 8011 gene families. The atlas includes detailed sequence alignments and profiles of nucleotide diversity for these orthogroup genes, illustrating their evolutionary dynamics within a phylogenetic ramework of rodent species (Figure 2A). Furthermore, among the 121 species, 31 genomes have been assembled o a high chromosomal resolution. The atlas facilitates precise comparative analyses of collinear blocks and synteny for any pair of these 31 high-quality genomes (Figure 2B). In addition, KEGG annotation analysis of the orthologous genes across these species revealed that the majority of genes were associated with signal transduction pathways (Figure 2C). This invaluable resource, in conjunction with the fundamental biological and environmental attributes of rodent species, provides a powerful ool or exploring ineage-specific sequence evolution, gene expansions or contractions linked to complex traits, diseases, and environmental adaptations. For instance, naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) s missing wo opsin genes, OPN1LW and OPN1MW which distinguishes it from other rodents (2 (Figure 2D). Additionally, a significant divergence in the immune system genes was observed between the closely related  

Eurasian red squirrel Sciurus vulgaris and eastern grey squirrel Sciurus carolinensis . Specifically, notable expansions were found in genes such as AKT, HSP90A  IFNA  VAV  TRBV OAS and TRAV  along with marked contractions in genes such as JNK  P38, MHC2 and IGH in Sciurus vulgaris compared o Sciurus carolinensis Figure 2E). These genetic differences may help explain the replacement of native red squirrels by invasive grey squirrels, potentially driven by host-parasite interactions (38 .  

# Compilation of zoonotic pathogens in rodent species  

To thoroughly investigate the relationship between pathogens harbored by rodents and their implications for public health, the RodentGPOmics Atlas presents a comprehensive dataset featuring 21 852 records of potential pathogen sequences that have been reported in rodents, including 2923 bacteria sequences (39 40  and 8475 zoonotic virus sequences. The atlas includes detailed epidemiological data on rodentassociated potential pathogen sequences, covering taxonomy, host species, sampling locations and dates, and geographic distributions (Figure 3A–D). An association analysis performed using the Gephi tool (41  has highlighted that rodent species closely linked to human habitats—including Rattus norvegicus  Rattus rattus  Mus musculus  Apodemus agrarius and Myodes glareolus—are prominent carriers of zoonotic pathogens (Figure 3E). Notable high-risk zoonotic pathogens identified include Anaplasma phagocytophilum Borreliella burgdorferi  Yersinia pestis  Puumala orthohantavirus and the tick-borne encephalitis virus. These pathogens are responsible for severe human diseases such as Human Granulocytic Anaplasmosis 42 , Lyme Disease 43 , he Black Death (44 , Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome and various central nervous system disorders. Furthermore, Lassa mammarenavirus  classified as a priority pathogen by the World Health Organization (WHO) (45 , has been detected in some rodent species, predominantly Mastomys natalensis  Human infections are predominantly acquired through either direct contact with excreta or contaminated articles emanating rom infected rodents, including but not limited to food and water sources, or hrough nterpersonal ransmission, particularly n the healthcare settings 46 . These findings highlight he significant zoonotic potential and the associated public health risks posed by this virus. The affected rodents, which host these pathogens, are distributed across diverse geographic regions and continents; however, the advance of efficient transportation systems has facilitated the easy movement of infected individuals between geographically distant continents, underscoring the global relevance of these zoonotic threats.

Moreover, this resource, in conjunction with comparative genomics of rodents, significantly advances our understanding of host-pathogen interactions and arms race trajectories. Notably, we dentified non-retroviral ntegrated RNA virus sequences (NIRVS) within rodent genomes. For example, the genome of Peromyscus polionotus subgriseus  which exhibits substantial divergence in immune genes compared to its sister species, revealed a prominent 600 bp sequence with $65\%$ dentity to a bat-derived filovirus. Additionally, various segments with notable similarity to flavivirus sequences were detected in 14 rodent species, including Sciurus carolinensis  Sciurus vulgaris  Acomys dimidiatus  Acomys kempi and Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii This finding underscores the intricate nature of pathogen-host co-evolution (47 48 .  

# The genomic tools for exploring rodent genomics  

The RodentGPOmics Atlas provides a suite of advanced genome exploration tools accessible through its web platform. These include genome browsers (genome module) (37 , collinearity analysis tools (synteny module) (30  and various genome sequence alignment tools such as BLAST (49 , Muscle (50 , Lastz (51  and Genewise (52 . Additionally, he atlas offers gene annotation tools such as GO and KEGG, which are ndispensable or unctional analysis n rodents. The alignment tools enable users to align their own sequences against rodent genomes, protein-coding sequences, protein sequences, or de novo assembled transcripts. The ‘primer design’ tool allows users to select a genomic region or input a sequence directly to design PCR primers. Furthermore, the gene annotation tools facilitate obtaining self-supplied gene annotations and conducting enrichment analysis in specific species. This robust array of ools significantly enhances he capabilities or in-depth genomic investigations and applications.  

Collectively, the RodentGPOmics Atlas stands as the most comprehensive compilation of the rodent species’ genomes and their associated pathogen sequences. We cover a wide range of rodent species, ncluding basic omics analyses such as genome assembly information, gene sequences and structures, gene functional annotations (NR, GO, KEGG, COG, SwissProt and Pfam), pan-genomics, and macro-synteny analysis of genomes. By developing a customized genome browser, we have achieved convenient visualization of complex genomic information. The database integrates comprehensive multiomics data and develops a wide range of analysis tools, establishing he most extensive and resource-rich multi-omics analysis platform or rodent species o date. This resource provides groundbreaking insights applicable to human biomedicine and advancements in rodent genetics and etiology.  

# Future directions  

Currently, high-quality genome sequences are predominantly biased towards the families Muridae and Cricetidae. However, with the rapid advancement of sequencing technologies and the increase in genome resources, it is anticipated that future efforts will encompass genomes of all rodent species. Moving forward, we will continuously update the database by incorporating additional annotations and functionalities from the NCBI, China National Center for BioinformationNational Genomics Data Center CNCB-NGDC), and EMBLEBI resources and tools. This expansion will include newly sequenced rodent species and ntegrate diverse multi-omics data, such as proteomics, metabolomics and phenomics. Leveraging machine learning-based approaches, we will delve deeper into multi-omics data to gain insights into the biology and evolution of rodents and their associated pathogens.

# ABSTRACT  

Virulence factors (VFs) are molecules that allow microbial pathogens to overcome host defense mechanisms and cause disease in a host. It is critical to study VFs for better understanding microbial pathogenesis and host defense mechanisms. Victors (http://www.phidias.us/victors) is a novel, manually curated, web-based integrative knowledge base and analysis resource for VFs of pathogens that cause infectious diseases in human and animals. Currently, Victors contains 5296 VFs obtained via manual annotation from peer-reviewed publications, with 4648, 179, 105 and 364 VFs originating from 51 bacterial, 54 viral, 13 parasitic and 8 fungal species, respectively. Our data analysis identified many VF-specific patterns. Within the global VF pool, cytoplasmic proteins were more common, while adhesins were less common compared to findings on protective vaccine antigens. Many VFs showed homology with host proteins and the human proteins interacting with VFs represented the hubs of human–pathogen interactions. All Victors data are queriable with a userfriendly web interface. The VFs can also be searched by a customized BLAST sequence similarity searching program. These VFs and their interactions with the host are represented in a machine-readable Ontology of Host–Pathogen Interactions. Victors supports the ‘One Health’ research as a vital source of VFs in human and animal pathogens.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Infectious diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms remain globally a major source of human mortality (1), and veterinary infectious diseases result in significant losses of livestock, pets and wildlife (2). Domestic animals and wild primates are also major sources of human infectious diseases (3). Approximately $60\%$ of all infectious diseases in humans are zoonotic diseases that are transmissible from animals to humans (4); however, there is still a big gap in understanding the underlying mechanism. To more effectively study the zoonotic diseases and achieve better public health outcomes, the emerging ‘One Health’ movement aims to unite human and veterinary medicine and integrate human, animal and environmental health (5). Understanding the molecular mechanisms that enable pathogens to cause infectious diseases is critical to find effective treatment strategies for combating human and animal infectious diseases. In particular, further studies of virulence factors (VFs) that allow microbial pathogens to evade host defense mechanisms and cause disease will improve rational vaccine and drug design for preventing and treating infectious diseases.  

Currently, several VF databases are available online. Among them, the Virulence Factors of Pathogenic Bacteria (VFDB) is a database of bacterial VFs with a focus on human bacterial pathogens (http://www.mgc.ac.cn/ VFs/) (6). VFDB does not include VFs from parasites, fungi or viruses. VFDB only provides general VF references without the detail of the experimental verification evidences. Another database, PHI-base (http://www.phi-base.org/) contains genes involved in host–pathogen interactions. In addition to its primary focus on plant pathogens, PHI-base also contains medically important pathogens that can cause human diseases, and the database provides links to appropriate publications (7). In addition to VFs, PHI-base also includes pathogen proteins that interact with host without known effect on pathogenesis (7). The PATRIC bacterial bioinformatics database BLASTs all genomes, both public and private, against a database of virulence factors and displays those genes with homology on a page showing information about the genome and on a page for specialty genes of interest (8,9). PATRIC imports the VFs from VFDB and Victors (the database introduced in this paper). In addition, PATRIC has manually curated virulence factors for some bacterial pathogens and provides integrative data annotation and analysis (10).  

To address the need for a comprehensive, curated database of human, animal and zoonotic pathogen VFs and to improve our understanding of the complexities of host–pathogen interactions, the Victors database was created. Victors is a manually curated, web-based (http://www. phidias.us/victors) VF database and analysis engine for human and animal pathogens. As an independent program in the PHIDIAS pathogen–host interaction database (11), whose original focus was on integrating existing sequence and disease information from various human and animal pathogens, the Victors VF database has an increased emphasis on the manual annotation and analysis of VFs. Each of the VFs in Victors is associated with manually annotated evidence from at least one peer-reviewed citation. It currently has over 5000 VFs from over 100 bacterial, viral, parasitic and fungal pathogens. The characteristics and functions of these VFs were extracted or analyzed using bioinformatics tools. Furthermore, Victors enabled us to make novel predictions about the interactions between specific proteins of the human host and experimentally verified microbial VFs.  

# SYSTEM DESIGN, ANNOTATION, ANALYSISPIPELINE AND STATISTICS  

# System and database design  

Victors is implemented using a three-tier architecture built on two University of Michigan virtual servers that run the Redhat Linux operating system (Redhat Enterprise Linux ES 4). Users can submit database or analysis queries through the web. These queries are then processed using PHP/SQL (middle-tier, application server based on Apache) against a MySQL (version 5.0) relational database (back-end, database server). The result of each query is then presented to the user in the web browser. Two servers are scheduled to back up data every week. Victors is a relatively independent program of the PHIDIAS database and analysis resource (11).  

# Semi-automatic annotation of VFs  

The semi-automatic Victors annotation system was developed by modifying an in-house web-based literature mining and curation system called Limix (11) (Supplementary Figure S1). The interactive Limix data submission and review system: (i) allows a curator to search literature, copy and edit text, and submit data to the database and (ii) provides a data reviewer tools to review, edit and approve the curated data on one comprehensive web interface. The major criterion to classify a VF is the loss or reduction of pathogenicity in the host after the VF gene mutation. Limix also features automated reference tracking and management. Upon approval after critical review by a domain expert (i.e. a scientist who is knowledgeable in the domain and has at least a postdoctoral position), the data will be posted publicly.  

# VF Statistics  

Victors currently contains 5296 VFs from 126 pathogens. Specifically, Victors includes 1160 VFs from 15 Grampositive pathogens, 3488 VFs from 36 Gram-negative pathogens, 179 VFs from 54 viruses, 105 VFs from 13 parasitic pathogens and 364 VFs from 8 fungal pathogens that primarily infect humans and other animal species (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1 shows representative statistics). More detailed statistical information is available at http://www.phidias.us/victors/stats.php.  

# Bioinformatic analyses  

The Clusters of Orthologous Group (COG) categories of VFs were retrieved from the NCBI COG database (12). The protein MW and PI are calculated from the protein sequences using the Bioperl program (https://bioperl.org/) (13). The Vaxign analysis pipeline (14) was used to analyze the subcellular localization, adhesin probability and conserved domains of VFs. Customized BLAST was used for BLAST sequence similarity search (15). For the prediction of host–pathogen protein–protein interactions (PPIs), the orthologs of proteins were defined by employing Inparanoid program (http://inparanoid.cgb.ki.se/) with default parameters (16), and the PPI database HPRD (http://www. hprd.org/) was used to identify the PPIs (17). More detail about PPI prediction is provided in Supplementary Figure S2.  

# Database contents  

For each specific VF, the Victors database contains the following information: (i) general information on each VF gene symbol, protein name, general gene/protein functions, COG category (if available), and DNA and protein sequences; (ii) manually annotated text from peer-reviewed article that proves the status of VF and (iii) computationally calculated results for each VF, for example, protein weight, protein pI, subcellular localization, adhesin probability, conserved domains of VFs and predicted PPIs (Figure 1). Supplementary Table S2 summarized the COG functional classification of all Victors VFs and Brucella VFs stored in Victors. More analysis results are described below.

# VF DISTINCT PATTERNS COMPARED TO PROTECTIVE ANTIGENS  

Previous studies found that protective antigens used for successful vaccine development are typically enriched in the areas of adhesin proteins, extracellular or cell surface bacterial proteins, and do not have sequence similarity to host proteins (18–20). We first compared the proportions of adhesin proteins in VFs and the vaccine immunogen proteins. We found that only $4\%$ of viral VFs are adhesins or adhesin-like proteins (Table 2), while in the remaining types of pathogens adhesins or adhesin-like proteins represent $9-$ $13\%$ of VFs. Using the same Vaxign analysis method (14), it was previously found that over $50\%$ of protective antigens used for development of experimentally verified vaccines are adhesins or adhesin-like proteins (20,21), showing that the VFs and protective antigens exhibit principally distinct molecular patterns.

We further examined the frequency of VFs that possess human orthologs, which were detected as defined in reference (14), among different groups of pathogens. Out of 4749 proteins, 1188 $(22\%)$ are homologous to some human proteins (Table 2). Among them, 30 $(29\%)$ out of 109 parasitic proteins and 180 $(49\%)$ out of 364 fungal proteins have orthologs in human proteins. In contrast, only 21 $(12\%)$ out of 179 viral proteins have human orthologs. There are 665 $(19\%)$ and 292 $(25\%)$ VFs from Gram-negative and Grampositive bacteria, respectively, which have homology to human proteins. The results suggest that fungi and parasites, both eukaryotic organisms, could much more frequently use the ‘orthologue strategy’ to interact with the host and as a mechanism of virulence. Similar results were obtained when the VFs were compared with the mouse proteome (Table 2).  

Finally, we examined the subcellular locations of VFs among different groups of pathogens, including distinctions between $\mathrm{{Gram}+}$ and Gram- bacterial VFs. Table 2 also shows the statistics of the cellular locations of virulence factors in $\mathrm{{Gram}+}$ and Gram- bacterial VFs. Interestingly, $82\%$ and $75\%$ of $\mathrm{{Gram}+}$ and Gram- bacterial VFs are located in the cytoplasmic and cytoplasmic membrane areas. However, the portions of extracellular or cell wall (or outer membrane) proteins are relatively low, representing $<20\%$ of the total bacterial VFs. These results indicate that key bacterial VFs are ‘designed’ to work inside the bacterial cells rather than on the surface or as secreted molecules. These results contrast with the patterns of bacterial protective antigens, where over $50\%$ protective antigens are located on the cell surface or secreted out (20). Therefore, similar to the adhesin and ortholog studies reported above, the VFs and protective antigens also follow differential patterns of subcellular localization.  

# PREDICTION OF HOST–PATHOGEN INTERACTIONS BASED ON VICTORS  

Our next goal was to assess the value of Victors in predicting pathogen–human PPIs based on the analyses of protein domains and phylogeny. Using all of the VFs experimentally verified in the human system, we searched for potential interactions among the host proteins. As detailed in  

Supplementary Figure S2, candidate PPIs were generated using ‘domain inferred’ and ‘ortholog inferred’ predictions (22–24). The ‘domain inferred prediction’ was used to infer inter-species PPIs based on the domain–domain interactions (DDI). Such DDI inference is theoretically supported by the conservation and importance of domains in proteins (24). If one domain in the pathogen protein A interacted with another domain in the human protein B (domain interacts with domain), we inferred these two proteins could potentially interact (protein A interacts with protein B). The ‘ortholog inferred prediction’ infers the inter-species PPIs based on their orthologs. If a specific protein A interacts with another protein B and has an ortholog protein C, we inferred that protein B and C interact with each other. The interactions generated using ‘domain inferred’ and ‘ortholog inferred’ methods were then combined into a unique human–pathogen interactome (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S2).  

Our initial candidate PPI predictions based on the ortholog and domain interfaces used all the proteins from individual pathogens. However, the results included many false positives since some pathogen proteins may not interact with host proteins due to various reasons (e.g. physical barriers). In order to increase the quality of the PPI predictions, we utilized experimentally verified VFs in Victors to screen candidate pairs. Based on our literature annotation, 553 VFs from 30 pathogen species were confirmed experimentally using human-specific analysis approaches (e.g. human cells). The PPI pairs that had no Victors’ VFs were removed. Finally, we inferred 15 334 human–pathogen interactions comprised of 185 VFs from 19 pathogen species and 2502 human proteins (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S3).  

Bacterial VFs interact with host (e.g. human) proteins in the complex process of bacterium–host interactions. Our approach predicted 15 334 bacteria–human PPIs from 11 bacteria (Supplementary Figure S3). For each of the 15 334 PPIs, we calculated the degree of proteins and then plotted the density curves (Supplementary Figure S3), which uncovered higher degree of VFs interactions with human proteins, compared to that of the entire bacterial proteome. These findings point out that relative to the non-VF bacterial proteins, VFs are much more likely to interact with human proteins.  

![](images/74ab8ad2764c2d3306aa3d51de129cc1aa5684fb628d7795e366b0db75884a84.jpg)  
Figure 2. Landscapes of predicted bacteria pathogen–human PPIs. (A) All 15 334 PPIs. (B) This figure shows that two pathogen proteins (GPT pyrophosphokinase rsh) from Brucella suis (Q8CY42) and Brucella melitensis (Q8YG65) interact with a group of human proteins (blue dots) on tRNA level, such as $\mathrm{\Deltat}$ -RNA editing proteins, tRNA ligase proteins. The GO enrichment analysis reveals that this group of proteins is enriched in tRNA aminoacylation (A2RTX5|Q9BW92|Q5JTZ9|P49588|P26639), corrected $P$ -value 9.5487E-12. (C) This figure shows that two human proteins lengsin (Q5TDP6) and Glutamine synthetase (P15104) interact with a group of pathogen proteins from different species, such as Streptococcus pneumonia and Brucella suis, Brucella melitensis. Interestingly, all pathogen proteins are Glutamine synthetase. Nodes in red color are pathogen proteins, and nodes in blue are human proteins.  

To visualize the landscape of predicted bacteria–human PPIs, Cytoscape (25) was utilized to display the interaction networks and perform GO enrichment analyses (Figure 2). The results revealed that most of the interactions were wellconnected and formed 31 component networks in 7 specific network patterns (Figure 2). Interestingly, many proteins are found at the nexus of ‘linkages’ or ‘hubs’ of large numbers of interactions. To further explore these multiple targeted proteins, we calculated the number of interacting bacterial VFs for each human protein (Supplementary Table S3). For example, each of two cell adhesion functional proteins, P13611 (Versican core protein) and Q96GW7 (Brevican core protein), connects to $17{\mathrm{VFs}},$ consistent with the process of attaching to human cells being required for bacterial virulence.  

# DATABASE QUERY AND ACCESS  

# Database query and Blast analysis  

The manually curated and pre-computed VFs data can be efficiently queried specifying one or multiple criteria: (i) gene or protein name, (ii) pathogen species or strain, (iii) locus tag of a VF, (iv) other existing database identifiers, such as NCBI Gene ID, NCBI nucleotide or protein GI, (v) keywords search with Boolean mode support, (vi) COG category, (vii) subcellular localization, (viii) four limiting factors, including the maximum number of transmembrane helices, the minimum adhesin probability and protein sequence similarity to human proteins, and protein sequence similarity to mouse proteins. User-friendly web interfaces are provided to display the results (Figure 3).  

To facilitate antigen comparison and dynamical sequence analysis, two customized BLAST libraries have been generated. One library contains the protein sequences of all VFs in Victors, and the other contains all of the DNA sequences from all VFs. Victors users are able to perform BLAST sequence similarity searches using different BLAST tools.

Figure 3. Example of Victors data query and BLAST sequence similarity analysis. In this example, a user selected ‘Mycobacterium tuberculosis’ in the ‘Pathogen or Disease’ menu bar and typed ‘transcriptional regulatory protein’. After clicking the ‘Search’ button, a list of 19 genes was shown up in the results page. A click on the Victors ID ${\bar{\cdot}}_{110},$ (the forth on the list) led to another page providing details about the VF (e.g. the gene mutation phenotype information and predicted interacting host proteins). A BLAST search was initiated by clicking ‘BLAST’.  

# Data transfer and download  

Several methods are provided in Victors to facilitate data exchange and transfer. First, a Victors web page (http://www. phidias.us/victors/download.php) is available for users to freely download the DNA and protein sequences of all VFs. In addition, after a web query from the Victors query website, a user can export queried VF information into a Microsoft Excel document.  

We have also created an Ontology of Host–Pathogen Interactions (OHPI; https://github.com/OHPI/ohpi/). OHPI is developed by following the Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry principles (e.g. openness and collaboration) (26). OHPI represents the VFs and how the mutants of VFs in Victors become less virulence inside a host organism or host cells. Currently, OHPI includes over 6700 terms. OHPI reuses existing ontologies (27). For example, OHPI reuses terms from the Gene Ontology (GO) (28), Ontology of Genes and Genomes (OGG) (29) and Cell Line Ontology (CLO) (30) to represent cellular components, genes and cell lines, respectively. OHPI includes object properties to semantically represent the relations between VFs and host entities (Supplementary Figure S4A). For example, the OHPI object property ‘gene mutant attenuated in host cell’ represents a relation between a gene and a host cell where the microbial mutant lacking the gene is attenuated in the host cell compared to the wildtype microbe. Such an object property can be used to represent a VF and its interaction in a host cell, for example, an oxidative stress response gene ahpC of $M.$ . tuberculosis strain H37Rv and mouse macrophage cell line J774 cell line (Supplementary Figure S4B), where the ahp $C$ mutant of strain H37Rv is attenuated in J774 cells (31). Using the machine-readable Web Ontology Language (OWL) format (http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-quick-reference), OWLbased software programs can be developed to parse and extract the information from the ontology and offer advanced data analysis. For example, using an OHPI SPARQL program (http://www.phidias.us/ohpi/sparql/), we could generate a simple SPARQL query script to identify 386 VFs whose mutants are attenuated in macrophages (Supplementary Figure S5A) and extract detailed information about the gene names, OGG IDs and VF annotations of these VFs (Supplementary Figure S5B).  

# Availability and requirements

# DISCUSSION  

This article is the first formal introduction of the Victors database, a comprehensive knowledge base focused on experimentally verified VFs for human and veterinary pathogens. In addition to all the manually curated VFs data, Victors also provides the OHPI ontology representation and computational analysis of the data and user-friendly web interfaces for querying and analyzing the results. Its usage will support researchers in the areas of microbiology, vaccinology and immunology with curated data and bioinformatics tools.  

Victors differs from existing VF databases in several significant ways. In addition to bacterial VFs as shown in VFDB (6), Victors includes VFs from viruses, parasites and fungi. While VFDB lists general references for a set of genes, Victors provides references for individual VFs and records the details on the experimental verification. Compared to PHI-base, which focuses on plant pathogens (7), Victors focuses on human and veterinary pathogens. The system design and data types for each VF among Victors, VFDB and PHI-base are also different. The Victors VF records are also semantically represented in the OHPI ontology. Data in the Victors database have been incorporated for many years by the PATRIC Specialty Genes resource (http: //patricbrc.org/portal/portal/patric/SpecialtyGenes), a wellrecognized bacterial bioinformatics database and analysis resource (9,10). While PATRIC can display Victors data, PATRIC does not provide all the details for each VF and is not responsible for the original annotation.  

The predicted interactions between human proteins and VFs provided by Victors have improved our understanding of the pathogenesis of these pathogens. We found that among all pathogen proteins, VFs have higher tendency to interact with human proteins (Supplementary Figure S3). There are two possible explanations for this phenomenon. First, pathogens tend to use the VFs to hijack host defense pathways for the benefit of microbial pathogenesis. Second, human proteins tend to interact with the VFs in order to fight against the pathogen virulence mechanism. Using human–pathogen PPIs, Dyer et al. demonstrated that pathogens preferentially interact with human proteins that are hubs and bottlenecks in human interaction pathways (32,33). However, these studies by Dyer et al. do not differentiate pathogen VFs with other pathogen proteins that are not VFs and thus do not typically significantly contribute to microbial pathogenesis to a significant degree. In contrast, our study provides the evidence that compared to other pathogen proteins, pathogen VFs are more likely to interact with human proteins. Moreover, the human–pathogen interactomes can be used to identify which biological pathways are possibly utilized by the pathogens to invade the host and to develop candidates for future experimental validation.  

We intend to keep adding new information to the resource. Our semi-automatic annotation pipeline makes the annotation process efficient. The manual curation and verification process (Supplementary Figure S1) ensures that every VF collected on the website has solid experimental evidence. Meanwhile, we are also testing new literature mining methods to ensure faster VF identification from literature. We also plan to mine and add more experimental conditions used for VF identification in the reported publications. As another future work, in contrast to the correlations between various factors, we will further add their direct associations or causal relations (i.e. network) to Victors by data-driven network methods (34).  

Victors is expected to become a central and vital source of VFs and their associated data and support the One Health initiative. It is estimated that ${\sim}75$ percent of emerging human pathogens in the past 25 years have originated in animals, and the risk of zoonotic transmission is likely to increase in the future (35). In recent years, the One Health concept has gained well recognition in the public health and animal health communities. Its usage will support researchers in the areas of microbiology, vaccinology and immunology with curated data and bioinformatics tools.

# ABSTRACT  

mBodyMap is a curated database for microbes across the human body and their associations with health and diseases. Its primary aim is to promote the reusability of human-associated metagenomic data and assist with the identification of disease-associated microbes by consistently annotating the microbial contents of collected samples using state-of-the-art toolsets and manually curating the meta-data of corresponding human hosts. mBodyMap organizes collected samples based on their association with human diseases and body sites to enable cross-dataset integration and comparison. To help users find microbes of interest and visualize and compare their distributions and abundances/prevalence within different body sites and various diseases, the mBodyMap database is equipped with an intuitive interface and extensive graphical representations of the collected data. So far, it contains a total of 63 148 runs, including 14 401 metagenomes and 48 747 amplicons related to health and 56 human diseases, from within 22 human body sites across 136 projects. Also available in the database are pre-computed abundances and prevalence of 6247 species (belonging to 1645 genera) stratified by body sites and diseases. mBodyMap

# INTRODUCTION  

Microbes inhabit almost all human body parts and play critical roles in human health and disease (1–4). The human microbiota is located primarily in the gut, where the numbers and diversity from the stomach to the colon multiply continuously (3,5). However, other anatomical parts, including the lungs, skin, vagina, eyes, placenta, ears, mouth and nasal compartments also harbor microbiomes (6,7). Microbiome’s composition varies depending on the anatomy (e.g. between the intestine and the lungs), between individuals and even over time (4,8–10); it can be altered by dietary changes (including the use of probiotics, the use of antibiotics and other drugs (11–14), age (15) or diseases) and other factors and is also dynamic (16–19). For instance, the human skin microbiome is highly personalized, depending on multiple factors, such as body site, age, gender and lifestyle elements (20–23). In addition to individual microbes (e.g. known pathogenic bacteria), changes in the composition of microbes (i.e. dysbiosis) are increasingly observed in many diseases, like colorectal cancer (CRC), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (24). Therefore, the importance of maintaining a healthy microbiota has garnered attention over the years, although the exact definition of ‘healthy microbiota’ remains to be provided (25,26). This increased attention has seen probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics developed and used to intervene in microbial dysbiosis and/or restore ‘healthy microbiota’ in cases of numerous diseases (13,27–38).  

Public databases, such as HMDAD (the Human Microbe-Disease Association Database) (39), Disbiome (22) and MicroPhenoDB (40) that store associations between human diseases and microbes across body sites have been established. Table 1 summarized their main features. Briefly, HMDAD and Disbiome collect text-mining-based microbe-disease associations from peer-reviewed publications and determine the strength of these associations based on the credibility of the data sources. MicroPhenoDB harvests microbe-disease relationships from the HMDAD and Disbiome databases and other open resources and is, therefore, the largest database with associations between microbes and diseases so far. However, despite the valued contributions to microbe-disease associations that these databases provide, they tend to focus primarily on individual pathogenic microbes through text-mining and largely overlook vital contributions from the microbial community as a whole on health and diseases. A comprehensive collection of curated and consistently annotated metagenomic datasets to link human-related microbes within different sites of the whole body to health and diseases, therefore, remains unavailable.  

In that regard, we developed mBodyMap, a curated database for microbes across 22 human body sites and their relationships with health and diseases. Overall, we collected 63 148 metagenomic samples/runs from both 16S rRNA and metagenomic next-generation sequencing $\mathrm{(mNGS)}$ across 136 projects. The core mBodyMap features include: (i) manually curated healthy and diseased information for each collected run/sample and all possible related meta-data, such as age, sex, country and bodymass-index (BMI); (ii) consistently annotated microbial contents, including taxonomic assignments of sequencing reads and precomputed species/genus relative abundances using state-of-the-art toolsets; (iii) collected samples organized based on their associated health control and diseases, sample harvesting body sites and statistics, including species-prevalence and abundances; (iv) equipment with an intuitive graphical representation of the distributions and abundances/prevalence of microbes across the human body that enables users to browse the distribution of microbes across the human body and compare microbes’ distribution among various diseases and health intuitively.  

# DATABASE CONSTRUCTION  

# Data collection of sequencing reads and manual curation of associated meta-data  

To identify human-related metagenomic datasets, we systematically searched public databases, including the NCBI BioProject (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/) and EBI ENA (41) (European Nucleotide Archive, https://www. ebi.ac.uk/ena) and manually examined related project information to determine the accuracy of datasets as humanassociated metagenomic datasets.  

Next, we downloaded the raw sequencing data from EBI ENA (41) and NCBI SRA (42) (Sequence Read Archive, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) using enaBrowserTools (https://github.com/enasequence/enaBrowserTools) and SRA-Tools (https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools) facilitated by Aspera (a high-speed data transfer tool). For each run and sample, we also downloaded relevant meta-data, including technical metadata, such as the sequencing platform, number of reads, and read length, and biological metadata, such as the body site from which the samples were taken, as well as the age, gender, country, body mass index (BMI), and disease(s) of the human host. We manually curated the meta-data twice: round one consisted of manually inspecting the extracted meta-information with the help of in-house R or Perl scripts to find all meta-data of interest; if necessary, the related publication(s), supplementary materials, and even the corresponding authors were consulted. During the second round of manual curation, different curators from the first round reviewed the collected meta-data and made necessary corrections.  

We stratified samples according to their associated human health or disease and body sites from which the samples were harvested. The body sites in question are as follows: ear, nose, oral, trachea, esophagus, upper respiratory tract, lung, stomach, uterus, cervix, fallopian tube, ovary, vagina, urethra, skin, blood, peritoneal fluid, large intestine and small intestine.  

# Processing of raw sequencing reads  

We processed the downloaded raw sequencing reads in FASTQ format using FastQC (v0.11.8, http://www. bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) to evaluate the quality and Trimmomatic (43) to remove low-quality bases and sequencing vectors. Sequences shorter than twothirds of the original read length were excluded from subsequent analyses.  

For 16S sequences, we used single-ended sequencing reads directly in ensuing analyses but merged pair-ended reads using Casper (44) v0.8.2 at default parameters before subsequently analyzing them. Metagenomic sequences comprising single-ended and pair-ended sequencing reads were all underwent subsequent analyses directly.  

We referred to the resulting sequences as ‘clean data’ and used them for further scrutiny. We also used Seqtk (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk) to convert FASTQ sequences to FASTA formats at default parameters if necessary.  

# Taxonomic assignment of processed sequencing reads and the calculation of relative abundances  

For 16S sequences, we used MAPseq v1.2 (45) to analyze the clean data and assign taxonomic classification information to the reads. As indicated by the creators of MAPseq, we applied a combined score of 0.4 at the genus level to assign the taxonomic classification. For each sample/run, the relative abundances at the genus and species levels were subsequently calculated, with total abundance values of $100\%$ .  

For metagenomic sequences, we used MetaPhlAn2 (46) at default parameters to assign taxonomic classification data to the sequencing reads and calculate relative abundances at species and genus levels.

# Quality controls for samples/runs  

We conducted sample/run level quality control to guarantee the quality of our data: first, we excluded amplicon samples/runs with $<5000$ reads from subsequent analyses and marked them as ‘failed QC (QC status $\mathit{\Theta}=0\mathit{\check{\Psi}}$ )’ in mBodyMap and then ensured samples/runs contained only a single taxon, i.e. we also marked a species or a genus accounting for more than or equal to $99.99\%$ of total abundance as ‘failed QC (QC status $=0$ )’.  

# Database construction and web development  

We loaded all data into the MySQL v5.7.25 (https://www. mysql.com/) database and coded the frontend (the webpages) of the website using HTML and JavaScript and the backend using Python v3.7.7 (https://www.python. org/) with a Flask v1.1.2 (https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) framework to support queries to the MySQL database. We bridged the front- and back- ends using the Vue.js v 2.6.12 (https://cn.vuejs.org/) framework and visualized the frontend with plotly.js v1.58.4 (https://github.com/plotly/plotly. js/). We also used several other open-source JavaScript libraries, including Element UI v2.15.1 (https://element. eleme.io/) and BootstrapVue v2.21.2 (https://code.z01.com/ bootstrap-vue/). The website is hosted on an Apache v2.4.29 (https://www.apache.org/) server.  

# DATABASE OVERVIEW AND FUNCTIONALITY  

# Overview of mBodyMap  

So far, mBodyMap contains 63 148 runs, including 14 401 metagenomic and 48 747 amplicon runs relating to health and 56 human diseases, linked to 22 human body sites across 136 projects (Figure 1A). Of the total, we considered  

61 913 runs ‘valid runs’ based on our quality controls and subsequent analysis processes.  

Through multiple rounds of manual curation, we assigned clear healthy or disease information to almost all collected samples, subsequently describing and organizing these information using the MeSH system (Medical Subject Headings, a controlled and hierarchically organized vocabulary produced by the National Library of Medicine). We identified health- and 56 diseases-related information from the microbiome data. Table 2 contains health and the top 10 diseases included in mBodyMap; they are ranked by the number of samples/runs they are linked-to in our database.  

We also strived to collect as voluminous meta-data as possible for the microbiome datasets; however, our ardent efforts yielded only three most basic host details: the age, sex, and BMI of a very small proportion $(3.97\%)$ of the samples (Figure 1B). $22.61\%$ of the samples contained none of the basic meta-data, while the rest contained only one or two $(64.23\%$ and $9.19\%$ , respectively) (Figure 1C). These results are consistent with our previous discovery in gut microbiome datasets (47). They indicate the difficulties in reusing metagenomic information and call for detailing guidelines of meta-information or metagenomic samples.  

We identified 6247 species belonging to 1645 genera from the 61 913 valid runs in our database, with 3710 of the species belonging to 1075 genera identified in more than one sample each (with a median relative abundance higher than $0.01\%$ within one or more health/diseases); these results match our previous finding from gut metagenome analysis that about $\sim50\%$ of microbes are specific to individuals (47). While the prevalence of most species is low, our results demonstrate that a small number of runs contained massive amounts of taxa under abundances limitation, expanding the recognized microbiota species in various parts of the human body. We believe that further analyses of samples will yield an increase in the total number of species/strains in various parts of the human body.

No. of valid runs: the number of runs whose data passed our quality control procedure, with the corresponding species/genus relative abundances available in our database. No. of associated species: the number of species associated with processed and valid runs. No. of associated genera: the number of genera associated with processed and valid runs.  

# Web usage  

mBodyMap provides a user-friendly and interactive portal for browsing and querying metagenomic data and related information. To help researchers find body site-health/disease associations, mBodyMap provides users with two search options: one requires a click on the directives depicting body sites of interest on the picture of a human body on the front page to view associated health or diseases, and the other demands choosing between health/diseases on the ‘Health&Disease’ page to view related body sites. For each body site-health/disease pair, we provide information about related projects and samples/runs and the associated species/genera and their relative abundances and prevalence in related samples. For example, to see related details on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease of the lung, users can select Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease on the ‘Health&Disease’ page and then the lung as the body site, for which the query result will show that there are 4026 associated microbial species assigned to 1270 genera. Of these, we identified only 274 species $(\sim6.81\%$ of the total) assigned to 86 genera $(\sim6.77\%$ of the total) in more than one sample, with a median relative abundance higher than $0.01\%$ . See https://mbodymap.microbiome.cloud/#/health&diseases/ Lung/Chronic%20Obstructive%20Pulmonary%20Disease/ D029424 for more details. Users may then select a species, such as Streptococcus mitis, to access further information, including its distribution and abundances in healthy and diseased samples; for more details, see https://mbodymap. microbiome.cloud/#/taxon/species/Lung/D029424/28037. The ‘Taxa’ page that includes ‘Species’ and ‘Genera’ pages is available to users who can browse through a microbe of interest to view the body sites it inhabits and the health or diseases it is associated with.  

The ‘Data’ page provides the manually curated metadata of metagenomic projects and samples/runs for users to download. Additional links to NCBI BioProject, NCBI SRA, and NCBI MeSH Browsers for each of the projects, runs, and health/diseases are available to help researchers download data and acquire more material. Furthermore, for each microbial taxon (i.e. species and genus), we have included links to the corresponding pages (if available) in public databases, such as NCBI Taxonomy (https://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) (48), GMrepo (a comprehensive gut microbiome database stratified by human phenotypes) (47), and MVP (a microbe-phage association database) (49). We intend to create more links to external databases as we continue to improve the site.  

# Species relative abundance and prevalence within and across diseases and body sites  

With the availability of pre-calculated relative abundances for all valid runs in mBodyMap, users can visualize the prevalence of microbes of interest in different diseases; for comparisons, the distributions of the microbes in healthy individuals are also provided. Figure 2A presents the distribution of Haemophilus parainfluenzae: a barplot is used to depict its prevalence in health and ten diseases associated with the upper respiratory tract (see also https://mbodymap.microbiome.cloud/#/taxon/species/ Upper%20respiratory%20tract/729; by default, diseases with ${>}10$ valid runs are included in this barplot). Additionally, we visualized its relative abundances across selected body sites in healthy controls and other diseases and compared the outcomes in a box plot (by default, diseases with ${>}10$ valid runs are included in this box plot; Figure 2B). To better illustrate the proportions of samples under different relative abundance thresholds for a species/genera across each body site, we created a line plot whose Y-axis represents the percentage of runs per all valid runs within certain ranges of relative abundances and whose X-axis denotes the threshold of relative abundances. The line plot displays the distribution of the relative abundances of selected taxons across selected body sites (Figure 2C).  

With mBodyMap, users can also explore the distribution of microbes of interest across body sites. Figure 3 shows a graphical representation of the human body used to show the abundances and prevalence of Streptococcus mitis across human body sites. We used different colors to represent various relative abundance and prevalence levels, enabling users to browse the distribution of microbes across the human body intuitively. The distributions of microbes of interest in both healthy and diseased sites are shown side by side. In our database, we identified $S.$ mitis in 22 body sites and associated them with 55 diseases (https:// mbodymap.microbiome.cloud/#/taxon/species/28037). The relative abundances and prevalence of $S.$ mitis were higher in multiple body sites of the diseased population than in the corresponding healthy sites, which is consistent with the characterization of $S.$ mitis as a pathogenic bacterium (Figure 3).  

# FUTURE DIRECTIONS  

In addition to continuously collecting new metagenomic data of various human body sites over the next few years, we plan to add new contents to mBodyMap, including (but not limited to) viral abundances, functional profiles, and metabolic pathway profiles of the collected samples. We also plan to include more functions that allow users to perform on-site cross-sample comparisons, differential abundance analyses, and mathematical modeling. Furthermore, we will aim to identify body site-specific or enriched species and microbial disease markers and compare them across datasets and projects. We have used the LEfSe (linear discriminant analysis effect size) (50) method to identify the marker microbes between health control and diseases in certain projects and visualized them on the web page; see the ‘in-depth analysis’ section of the following page for an example: https://mbodymap.microbiome.cloud/ #/data/project/PRJNA275918. This feature will be available for all projects in the future. These developments should promote the reusability and accessibility of human metagenomic data further and help users better understand the relationship between the dysbiosis of microbiota at multiple body sites and human diseases.

# CONCLUSION  

This article introduces mBodyMap, a curated database for microbes across the human body and their associations with health and diseases. So far, mBodyMap contains 63 148 runs, including 14 401 metagenomes and 48 747 amplicons relating to health and 56 human diseases, linked to 22 human body sites across 136 projects. We aim to provide a central resource for curated and consistently annotated microbes from various human body sites, which would allow users to quickly find microbes of interest and visualize their distributions across the human body and facilitate the identification of site- and/or disease-specific marker microbes. We collected the metagenomic datasets of human samples from multiple sources, manually curated their meta-data, and annotated their microbial contents using state-of-theart toolsets. We then stratified samples according to the human health or diseases and body sites they are linked to and pre-computed species/genus relative abundances and prevalence. As compared with existing databases on microbe-human disease associations, mBodyMap focuses on metagenomics data and highlights the important roles of the microbial community as a whole in health and diseases. In the future, we will add more data and functions to mBodyMap.

# Abstract  

Among the diverse sources of neoantigens (i.e. single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions or deletions (Indels) and fusion genes), fusion gene-derived neoantigens are generally more immunogenic, have multiple targets per mutation and are more widely distributed across various cancer ypes. Therefore, usion gene-derived neoantigens are a potential source of highly mmunogenic neoantigens and hold great promise or cancer mmunotherapy. However, he ack of usion protein sequence esources and knowledge prevents his application. We ntroduce FusionNeoAntigen’, a dedicated resource for fusion-s neoantigen cessible ionNeoAntigen  In this resource, we provide fusion gene breakpoint ${\sim}43\mathsf{K}$ $\sim16K$ enes from FusionGDB2.0. FusionNeoAntigen provide ptide sequences, fusion gene-derived neoanti ens and human leucocyte antigens HLAs), ith usion-specific neoantigen, potential develop fusion gene-based immunotherapies. We will report all potential fusion-specific neoantigens from all possible open reading frames of $\sim120\mathsf{K}$ human fusion genes in future versions.

# Introduction  

Tumor neoantigens are products from the cancer-specific mutated genes that are presented by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins and recognized by $\mathrm{CD8+}$ or $\mathrm{CD4+}$ T cells. Neoantigens derived from single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions-deletions (Indels) have been the most frequently studied. However, gene fusions are also valuable sources of tumor neoantigens due to their ability to generate new open reading frames (ORFs). More importantly, compared o SNV and ndel neoantigens, usion gene neoantigens are generally more immunogenic, have multiple targets per mutation and are more widely distributed across various cancer types (1 2 . As a consequence, they constitute a crucial type of tumor neoantigen and are increasingly being targeted for cancer immunotherapies. n addition, usion gene neoantigens have multiple applications, ncluding serving as prognostic biomarkers of immune checkpoint blockade and in the development of tumor vaccines, and adoptive cell therapies.  

Neoantigen studies have been increasingly reported since 2015. However so far there have been only 56 studies reporting on the neoantigens of 33 fusion genes out of 266 manually curated in-frame fusion genes. Information from individual studies is listed in Table 1 Compared to studies on the neoantigens derived rom SNVs or ndels, he number of studies on fusion neoantigens remains limited. This is because of the lack of fusion protein sequence resources and limited understanding of this domain. Even though there were several studies/pipelines for the prediction of fusion gene-derived fusion neoantigens in human cancer, hose were only focused on specific cancer patients or cell lines. Also, no comprehensive studies were performed on fusion gene-derived neoantigens due to the lack of a reliable source of human fusion protein sequences (3–10 . Most importantly, those studies lack functional annotation of the consequences resulting from the inhibition of such usion gene unctions when he mmune systems attack those cancer cells with fusion-specific neoantigens (1 . This ack of annotation has reduced nterest or and prevented consensus in the need for further studies of fusion neoantigens. However, many cancers have a high frequency of fusion gene patients (such as rare childhood cancers) for which there are no efficient targeted therapies developed, and are still awaiting to have individual fusion-specific targeted therapies. Given this context, here is an imperative need to create a comprehensive resource of fusion gene-specific neoantigens for all human cancer types, comprehend the landscape of the fusion neoantigens, understand the functional effect of fusion neoantigens on cancer, to select potential immunotherapeutic targets for the fusion genes lacking targeted therapeutics, and to facilitate the development of effective cancer vaccine.  

To fill this gap, we built the FusionNeoAntigen database, which provides potential fusion breakpoint-specific neoantigens throughout ${\sim}102\mathrm{K}$ human fusion genes. From our previous study, FusionGDB2 (11 , we successfully translated $\sim$ 43K fusion protein sequences from ${\sim}82\mathrm{K}$ full-length fusion transcripts based on ${\sim}16\mathrm{K}$ n-frame usion genes. These usion protein sequences are currently being imported into UniProt as the reference source of human fusion protein sequences. Furthermore, in FusionPDB, we share the 3D structures of more than 3K fusion proteins. In this study, based on the ${\sim}43\mathrm{K}$ fusion protein sequences, we predicted the fusion genederived neoantigens using he HLA binding affinity-based prediction tools (i.e. NetMHCpan and deepHLApan). To provide the usion-specific neoantigens, we filtered out he neoantigens that are not crossed over the fusion protein breakpoint position. After filtering based on the output values of those tools, we finally dentified about 10K and 7K usion breakpoints hat have potential interaction with HLA-Is and HLA-IIs, respectively. In total, we identified ${\sim}52\mathrm{K}$ and ${\sim}19\mathrm{K}$ fusion-specific neoantigens that interact with HLA-Is and HLA-IIs, respectively. Each of these fusion breakpoints in the fusion protein sequences has multiple neoantigens crossing he usion protein breakpoints. Taking the fusion breakpoint 14 AA sequence (since the minimum protein sequence length for prediction of protein structure s $14\mathrm{AA}$ in the RoseTTAFold), we predicted the 3D structures of ${\sim}10\mathrm{K}$ fusion breakpoint 14 AA peptides.

For these predicted fusion breakpoint peptide structures, we performed virtual screening against 25 different HLAs, which have known 3D structures from PDB. Then, about $85.7\%$ of interactions were still found in the virtual screening results. FusionNeoAntigen will help to develop fusion gene-based immunotherapies.  

FusionNeoAntigen is the only resource that provides the potential fusion-specific neoantigens derived from all currently known human cancer fusion genes. FusionNeoAntigen will acilitate he advancement of mmunotherapies or usionpositive patients. We believe that information about cancer fusion neoantigens will grow in both size and importance in the forthcoming years. This resource will be routinely used by diverse cancer and drug research communities. In the future, we will make all potential ORF-based fusion protein sequences including frame-shift fusion genes, and predict the fusion-specific neoantigens from these all potential ORFs.  

# Materials and methods  

Fusion gene information and making fusion protein sequences   
We obtained 16146 unique in-frame fusion genes from FusionGDB2.0 (11  (Supplementary Table S1). For these fusion genes, we have the following information: sample ID or expressed sequence ag EST) D, ${{\bar{S}}^{\prime}}$ gene, chromosome, breakpoint, strand and $3^{\prime}$ gene, chromosome, breakpoint, strand information and full-length fusion transcript sequences. Out of these, $14~725$ in-frame fusion genes could finally make fusion amino acid sequences based on the GRCh37 human reference genome from the result of ORFfinder (12 . The methods for using the fusion protein sequences from multiple genomic breakpoints and multiple gene isoforms are described in the FusionGDB2.0 study as follows. Two different genes can form fusion genes with multiple breakpoints based on multiple gene isoforms. Therefore, we considered all gene isoforms at each breakpoint. To help identify and validate fusion genes, we focused on in-frame fusion genes. For more reliable fusion genes, we checked the distance between the two breakpoints in case of intra-chromosomal rearrangements and created fusion sequences when those genes are separated by ${\tt>}100\$ kb. We also selected fusion genes when both breakpoints aligned at the exon junction. To call each exon sequence of the given breakpoints, transcription start/end sites and CDS start/end sites, we used the nibFrag utility from UCSC Genome Browser based on ENCODE hg19 genome structure. Then, we made 83290 full-length fusion transcript sequences of 16 146 in-frame fusion genes. If these fusion transcript sequences have ORF annotation results from ORFfinder, we selected the longest amino acid sequence as the one for the fusion transcript sequence. As a result, we have 43K fusion protein sequences (level 1) (https://compbio.uth.edu/FusionGDB2/combined_ ables/ combinedFGDB2genes_chimerkb4_ usiongdb2_AA_seq.txt . Out of these 16K in-frame fusion genes, we decided to focus on he recurrent usion genes, which were expressed n at east two patients or cell lines. Then, 2300 recurrently expressed fusion genes were used to make 12 354 possible fusion proteins (level 2). To select more reliable fusion genes, we used ChimerKB4.0 from ChimerDB 4.0 fusion gene knowledgebase (13 . We obtained 1597 fusion genes with publication support and experimental evidence. Among these, only 266 fusion genes were in-frame and potentially made 1267 fusion proteins. We provide the same annotation result per fusion gene, but we intended to let the user know the importance of individual fusion genes at these levels.  

# Functional annotation of fusion proteins  

To assign functional or genetic categories, we integrated cancer genes, tumor suppressors, epigenetic regulators, DNA damage repair genes, human essential genes, kinases and transcription actors. n each gene group, we checked he retention and ORFs of the main protein functional features. There are 13 features belonging to the ‘region’ category, including ‘calcium binding’, ‘coiled coil’, ‘compositional bias’, ‘DNA binding’, domain’, intramembrane’, motif’, nucleotide binding’, ‘region’, ‘repeat’, ‘topological domain’, ‘transmembrane’ and ‘zinc finger’. To perform the protein functional feature retention search, we first downloaded the GFF (General Feature Format) format protein information of $10651$ UniProt accessions from UniProt (14  for $10~619$ genes involved in $15\ 030$ fusion genes. UniProt provides the loci information of 39 protein features, including six molecule processing features, 13 region features, four site features, six amino acid modification features, two natural variation features, five experimental info features, and three secondary structure features. Since such feature loci information was based on amino acid sequence, the genomic breakpoint information was converted into amino acid sequences while considering all UniProt protein accessions, ENST isoforms and multiple breakpoints for each partner. To map each feature to the human genome sequence, we used the GENCODE gene model of human reference genome v19 (15 . For the ${5}^{\prime}$ partner gene, we considered the protein feature to be retained in the fusion gene if the breakpoints occurred on the $3^{\prime}$ end of the protein feature. On the contrary, if a protein domain was not entirely included in the fusion amino acid sequence, we reported that such fusion genes did not retain that protein feature. Similarly, for the $3^{\prime}$ partner gene, we considered the fusion gene to have retained the protein feature if the breakpoints occurred on the ${5}^{\prime}$ end of the protein feature region.  

# Identification of the breakpoint in the fusion protein sequences  

Even though we can determine fusion protein sequences from the full-length fusion mRNA sequences, we do not know the position of the breakpoint in the fusion protein sequences. To identify the breakpoint of all fusion protein sequences, we ran BLAT (16 , a pairwise sequence alignment algorithm with high accuracy for long sequence alignment, by inputting ${\sim}43\mathrm{K}$ fusion protein sequences. Then, we selected the breakpoints from the two major alignment regions that have more than 90 percent dentity, wo ongest matched engths, and he matched start and end positions are he same as he DNA evel fusion breakpoints of our fusion genes.  

# Prediction of the fusion-specific neoantigens  

For 43 464 fusion protein sequences, we made 12 790 unique $\pm13$ AA fusion breakpoint peptide sequences from the breakpoints (Supplementary Table S2) that were identified by running BLAT. We downloaded the information on the HLAI and HLA-II alleles from The Cancer Immunome Atlas (https:// cia.at/home  and NetMHCIIpan-4.1 server (https:// services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCIIpan-4.1/  (17 , respectively. Then, 12 790 fusion breakpoint peptide sequences as well as HLA molecules were queried for peptideMHC complex (pMHC) binding affinity using NetMHCpan 4.1 (https://services.healthtech.dtu.dk/services/NetMHCpan4.1/) (18  and NetMHCIIpan 4.1. For HLA-I molecules, peptides tagged as strong binders $(\%\mathrm{{rank\_EL}}<0.5)$ ) were retained as the input of deepHLApan (version 1.1) (19 . According to the outputs of the deepHLApan model, the candidate neoantigens with immunogenic scores $>0.5$ were further screened out. For HLA-II alleles, we retained the predicted neoantigens with %rank_EL $<0.5$ . For these predicted fusion neoantigens, we chose the neoantigens that cross the fusion breakpoints so that at least one AA is aligned with one protein and the left length is aligned with the other protein part.  

# mRNA sequences of the fusion-specific neoantigens  

Since we generated the full-length transcript sequence based on the given breakpoint and gene isoforms, we know the exact mRNA sequence of he predicted usion neoantigen peptide. The table in the section ‘Vaccine Design for the FusionNeoAntigens (RNA/protein sequences)’ provides the fusion neoantigen sequence and their corresponding RNA sequence. Therefore, our fusion-specific RNA sequence information for the fusion-specific neoantigens will help the researchers to generate the optimal DNA sequence more easily without the codon optimization.  

# Prediction of the 3D structures of fusion breakpoint 14AA peptides  

To check the interaction between the fusion breakpoint peptides and HLAs, we predicted the 3D structures of individual fusion breakpoint peptides through AI-based RosettaFold (20 . t is a powerful computational method that combines ab initio modeling, comparative modeling and evolutionary information to predict protein structures by taking amino acids as nput. RosettaFold has been successful n predicting protein structures, especially or small o medium-sized proteins. Since the minimum length required for the accurate predictions of protein structure through RoseTTAFold, was 14AA, we made the fusion breakpoint 14AA peptide sequences of $\sim10\mathrm{K}$ fusion breakpoints (Supplementary Table S3) that have the potential fusion neoantigens from running the binding affinitybased prediction tools. We made the library of 3D structures of ${\sim}10\mathrm{K}$ predicted neoantigens or he neoantigen-HLA docking interaction study.  

# Prediction of the interaction between the fusion breakpoint 14AA peptides and HLAs  

We performed molecular docking simulations between the neoantigens library and HLA to obtain the interaction information. Grid size represents the volume of a receptor’s active sites where the small molecule can search for binding while docking. The grid around the receptor of HLA-A was generated using the module Receptor Grid Generation (Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2021). The dimensions of the grid were selected by considering the active site information available in the PDB database. We searched the known structure of HLA-A and bound to it ligands from in the PDB database. While making the grid through the Receptor Grid Generation tool, we consider those residues which are reported in the PDB database as residues that are involved in binding interaction. Virtual screening is a computational technique used in the drug discovery process to select small molecules that are most likely to bind to receptors or target molecules. In this work, we considered around $\sim10\mathrm{K}$ neoantigen small molecule libraries. These selected libraries were preprocessed by LigPrep (Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2021) module and made available for virtual screening. Then, finally, we ran the GLIDE (21 , a tool for virtual screening provided by Schrödinger (2021) against the known 21 HLA 3D structures (Supplementary Table S4).  

# Selection of cell surface fusion proteins  

We download the cell surface gene list from The Cancer Surfaceome Atlas (22 . We have 3557 cell surface protein-coding genes in humans. After overlapping these genes with our ${\sim}14\mathrm{K}$ in-frame fusion genes, there were 4297 fusion genes that have cell surface protein as one of the fusion partners. For these fusion proteins, we investigated the transmembrane domain retention. Then, here were 544 fusion proteins (Supplementary Table S5). To predict the potential of the transmembrane localization, we ran DeepLoc, a multi-label subcellular localization prediction using protein language models (23 . Using RoseTTAFold 20 , we predicted he 3D structures of these cell surface fusion proteins.  

# Manual curation of fusion neoantigen literature  

By investigating the open reading frames from 1.5K manually curated fusion genes from ChimerKB4 (13 , we determined there were only 266 translated fusion genes that could potentially produce fusion proteins. For these 266 fusion genes, we searched the PMC full-text literature that has previous results on neoantigen for individual fusion genes using the search terms, BCR and ABL1 and neoantigen’ (date: July 2023). For this, we made a Python script to grab the HTML page information of the PMC searching results and parsed the number of studies and PMIDs. Then, we manually checked those papers on he usion neoantigens. While we searched he web using our script, we considered gene synonyms also. Ultimately, there were only 56 previous studies on fusion neoantigens for 33 fusion genes.  

# Drug and disease information  

For all genes involved in these curated fusion genes, drug– target interactions (DTIs) were extracted from DrugBank (January 2021, version 5.1.8) with the duplicated DTI pairs excluded (24 . All drugs were grouped using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system codes. We also searched PubMed literature evidence on the drugs that were reported as inhibiting or targeting individual fusion genes using this search expression, ‘((BCR [Title/Abstract]) AND ABL1 [Title/Abstract]) AND fusion [Title/Abstract]) AND drug [Title/Abstract]’. After a manual review of the abstracts, we found 45 fusion genes treated by 34 drugs in 36 types of diseases. We also searched the website of MyCancerGenome of individual 266 fusion genes, we found 34 fusion genes treated by 28 drugs. There were 149 fusion genes expressed in 108 types of diseases. In total, there were 77 fusion genes were targeted by 62 drugs, and 155 fusion genes were reported in 107 diseases.  

# Database architecture  

The FusionNeoAntigen system is based on a three-tier architecture: client, server and database. It includes a user-friendly web interface, Perl’s DBI module and MySQL database. This database was developed on MySQL 3.23 with the MyISAM storage engine.

# Overview of FusionNeoAntigen  

FusionNeoAntigen provides intensive information on the fusion-specific neoantigens that can be potentially derived from 10 320 human fusion genes among ${\sim}14\mathrm{K}$ translatable fusion genes of ${\sim}102\mathrm{K}$ human fusion genes. Figure 1 shows the overview of FusionNeoAntigen annotation. First, we provide ${\sim}13\mathrm{K}$ fusion breakpoint amino acid sequences with $\pm13$ AA length of ${\sim}43\mathrm{K}$ fusion protein sequences as the input for the prediction of the fusion neoantigens (Figure 1A). Second, we provide information on the predicted fusion-specific neoantigens of $\mathord{\sim}500\mathrm{K}$ interaction pairs between fusion breakpoint-specific neoantigens and HLAs. Third, we provide information on the potential cell surface fusion proteins. The main features of FusionNeoAntigen annotations are summarized below.

gens that were reported in the previous studies from wellknown fusion genes (i.e. BCR-ABL1 and TMPRSS2-ERG) did not cross the fusion breakpoints but rather aligned to only one gene part, which can occur with wild type genes also. To avoid this situation, we chose neoantigens that crossed the fusion breakpoints so that at least one AA is aligned with one protein and the left length is aligned to the other protein part. Luckily, $93.1\%$ (10 018 out of 10 759) and $97.7\%$ (5762 out of 5895) fusion genes had the potential fusion neoantigens that are crossing the fusion breakpoints. $10~649$ and 6039 unique fusion breakpoints had $\sim52\mathrm{K}$ and $\sim19\mathrm{K}$ fusion neoantigens that crossed the fusion breakpoints and interacted with the HLA-Is and HLA-IIs, respectively. In total, there were $1\ 008\ 363$ interactions with HLA-Is and 452 038 interactions with and HLA-IIs. Furthermore, upon checking the crossing of the breakpoint of all predicted fusion neoantigens, almost half of the fusion neoantigens with potential interaction with HLA-Is were filtered out. As a result, we had 493 279 pairs of interactions between $51~856$ fusion breakpoint-specific neoantigen candidates and 351 HLA-I alleles. For he HLA-IIs, here were $432746$ pairs of nteractions between 19 223 usion breakpoint-specific neoantigens candidates and 605 HLA-IIs.  

Since the goal of neoantigen prediction is to develop a cancer vaccine, the annotation page of the FusionNeoAntigen website provides the fusion neoantigen mRNA sequences. Since we predicted the fusion neoantigen peptide sequences from fusion transcript sequences, we have the matched fusion mRNA sequence or he usion neoantigen sequences. n otal, we have 51 658 HLA-I interacting and 19 240 HLA-II interacting unique mRNA sequences from the fusion neoantigens. Table 3 shows he most requent usion genes hat have usionspecific neoantigens interacting with 25 known HLA structures. Even hough TMPRSS2-ERG has many sample requencies of fusion genes, after investigation of the open reading frames of those fusion gene/ ranscript sequences, there were not many in-frame and translational fusion genes, indicating a limited number of samples have the fusion-specific neoantigens. However, BCR-ABL1 and EML-ALK had many n-frame fusion genes rom multiple breakpoints and had more samples that have potential fusion-specific neoantigens. Out of these top 100 most frequent fusion genes that have fusion-specific neoantigens, only 11 fusion genes had previous records on the studies of fusion neoantigens.  

# Filtered fusion neoantigens by performing the virtual screening between 25 HLA-is that have known 3D structures and $\mathord{\sim}10\mathsf{K}$ fusion protein breakpoint 14AA peptide structures  

To further validate the interaction between the potential fusion protein breakpoint-specific neoantigens and provide more reliable fusion breakpoint-specific neoantigens, we used the virtual screening approach between the 3D structures of the fusion neoantigens and the publicly available 3D structures of the HLAs. Between 10 836 3D structures of $10~879$ unique $\pm7$ AA (14 AA) from the fusion breakpoints and 21 known 3D structures of the HLAs, we found that $10\ 017$ fusion genes have interaction using the virtual screening approach. We first determined the active site of the predicted structures of 10 879 peptides using SiteMap. Then, we performed the virtual screening of individual pairs using Glide. This yielded a total of 422872 pairs of interactions between $10\ 879$ peptides and $21~\mathrm{HLA}$ known molecules in 10 017 fusion genes (10 649 fusion breakpoints). Overall, $85.7\%$ (422 872 out of 493 279) pairs of fusion-specific neoantigens and HLAs had virtual screening evidence. Figure 2A shows he example of nine frequent and well-known fusion genes’ complexes n 3D between he HLAs and ndividual usion neoantigens. Figure 2B shows their information with the interaction scores.  

# FusionNeoAntigen annotation page  

Figure 3 shows the major annotation categories in the FusionNeoAntigen website. First, we show he usion protein sequences of each usion gene Figure 3A). Considering multiple breakpoints and gene isoforms, each fusion gene can be expressed as multiple fusion protein sequences. From the given DNA breakpoints of individual fusion genes, we made fulllength fusion mRNA sequences and checked the open reading frames. Then, for the in-frame fusion mRNA sequences, we input to the ORFfinder and chose the longest ORF’s amino acid sequences. For the well-known fusion genes, we checked their DNA breakpoints and their fusion amino acid sequences whether our annotation is right or not. From these fusion protein sequences, we made $\pm13$ AA long peptides from the breakpoints at the top of Figure 3B. This is the starting material to predict the fusion breakpoint-specific neoantigens. Then, we show the information of the predicted fusionspecific neoantigens in the table including the breakpoints, fusion neoantigen peptide sequence, interacting HLA allele name, binding affinity scores and immunogenic scores. We also provide the multiple sequence alignment of all predicted fusion neoantigens crossing the breakpoint per fusion breakpoint. To have more reliable fusion neoantigen candidates, we predicted the 3D structures of the peptide of $\pm7$ AA length from the breakpoints and checked the binding between these structures and known 3D structures of 21 HLAs. We show these 3D structures and their docking scores as shown at the bottom of Figure 3B. In FusionNeoAntigen, we also provide information on the potential cell surface fusion proteins as the potential source of CAR-T therapy. As shown in Figure 3C, we show their potential 3D structure, transmembrane domain retention information and subcellular localization prediction result of the given cell surface fusion protein sequence.  

# Clinical usage of FusionNeoAntigen  

Current research primarily focuses on neoantigens resulting from single-nucleotide variants SNVs) and nsertions or deletions (Indels) (25 . However, the scope of tumor neoantigens is limited in tumors with high burdens of SNVs or Indels. Therefore, expanding the range of tumor neoantigens is crucial to extend the applicability of neoantigen-based immunotherapies to a broader population of cancer patients. Gene fusions represent a significant form of genetic alteration in cancer, playing a crucial role in early tumorigenesis and accounting for approximately $20\%$ of global cancer cases (26 . These fusions occur due to structural variations in chromosomes (SV) and can result in the creation of new open reading frames (ORFs) (27 . Peptides derived from the regions where two genes fuse differ from self-antigens and serve as excellent sources of neoantigens. Patients’ T cells can recognize these neoantigens, as observed in cases like BCR-ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia and SYT-SSX1 in synovial cell sarcoma (28 . Consequently, neoantigens derived from gene fusions have the potential to expand the existing repertoire of tumor neoantigens and offer promising prospects for cancer immunotherapy Notably even n umors with ow umor mutational burden (TMB) and limited immune cell infiltration, neoantigens generated by gene fusions can still activate cytotoxic T cells (27–29 . A study examining fusion neoantigens from the TCGA data found that fusion genes have the potential to produce a significantly higher number of novel open reading frames (ORFs) compared to single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions (INDELs), resulting in a six-fold increase in neoantigens and an eleven-fold increase in specific candidate neoantigens. Fusion neoantigens are more likely o elicit a robust mmune response compared o neoantigens generated by SNVs and INDELs. Similar to the burden of candidate neoantigens derived rom SNVs and NDELs, he burden of fusion neoantigens is closely associated with the frequency of fusion mutations, particularly in microsatellitestable tumors with a higher fusion mutation burden (1 30 . In an expanded study across 30 different tumor types, it was observed that $24\%$ of fusion protein-expressing cancers harbored neoepitopes resulting rom such usion events, and hese neoantigens were predicted to bind to patient-specific MHC-I molecules (27 31 . In this context, the information provided in FusionNeoAntigen is useful to develop new immunotherapeutics for multiple types of human cancer.

# Discussion  

In FusionNeoAntigen, we provide comprehensive information on $\sim500\mathrm{K}$ and $19\mathrm{k}$ fusion breakpoint-specific neoantigens that interact with HLA-Is and HLA-IIs in $\sim10\mathrm{K}$ and $5.7\mathrm{K}$ human fusion genes in cancer, respectively. Further virtual screening between the fusion breakpoint-specific peptides of 14 AA length and the known 3D structures of 21 HLAs identified about $85.7\%$ of interacting pairs kept from almost all fusion neoantigens that were predicted as interacting with HLA-Is. We also provide nformation on he potential cell surface fusion proteins. To predict the structures of the fusion breakpoint peptides and cell surface fusion proteins, we used an AI-based protein structure prediction tool, RosettaFold. However, since RoseTTAFold relies on a database of known protein structures to make predictions and neoantigens derived rom he usion breakpoints are unique. As hey may not have structurally similar counterparts in the database, we admit that a lack of training data for fusion proteins can affect the accuracy of the fusion breakpoint peptide structure predictions. Even so, about $85.7\%$ of the binding affinity-based predicted interactions between fusion breakpoint peptides of $14\mathrm{AA}$ and 21 HLA-Is recurred n he virtual screening results. These fusion-specific neoantigen candidates can be novel resources for new therapy development in cancer.

In this study, we predicted the fusion-specific neoantigens that are crossing the breakpoints of all human in-frame fusion genes since our study material, which s he usion breakpoint peptide sequences was made based on our previous study, FusionGDB2.0. In FusionGDB2.0, we focused on the in-frame fusion genes only and did not generate frame-shift fusion protein sequences. This was due to the significance of the reliably translatable fusion genes and the huge data size of all open reading frames’ full-length fusion transcript sequences considering multiple breakpoints and multiple gene isoforms of each fusion gene. However, when we checked the reported fusion neoantigens from previous studies, all the fusion neoantigens regardless of crossing the breakpoints or not, the fusion neoantigen sequences of the well-known fusion genes (BCR-ABL1, EWSR1-FLI1, TMPRSS2-ERG and CBFB-MYH11) were all from the in-frame fusion genes that were included in our prediction. Also, we provide the multiple sequence alignment of all predicted neoantigens at each fusion breakpoint if the neoantigen crosses the breakpoint at least one residue. Even though focused on the in-frame fusion genes, we have $\sim500\mathrm{K}$ fusion neoantigens from $\sim14\mathrm{K}$ in-frame fusion genes, which means there are about 30 fusion neoantigens predicted per fusion gene. Therefore, at this stage, we think in-frame fusion gene-derived neoantigens still provide useful information from the unique combination of two different genes’ degraded peptides. In the future, we will

We hope FusionNeoAntigen can provide helpful knowledge on the development of cancer type-specific fusion-specific targeted immune therapies so that fusion gene-induced cancer patients can have the right personalized therapeutics. We believe FusionNeoAntigen will be routinely used in diverse research communities, ncluding cancer research, genomic study, pharmacology study, etc. We will provide guidelines to improve the findability accessibility interoperability and reuse of digital assets (FAIR).

# ABSTRACT  

Extensive research into hematopoiesis (the development of blood cells) over several decades has generated large sets of expression and epigenetic profiles in multiple human and mouse blood cell types. However, there is no single location to analyze how gene regulatory processes lead to different mature blood cells. We have developed a new database framework called hematopoietic Systems Biology Repository (SBR-Blood), available online at http://sbrblood.nhgri.nih.gov, which allows userinitiated analyses for cell type correlations or genespecific behavior during differentiation using publicly available datasets for array- and sequencingbased platforms from mouse hematopoietic cells. SBR-Blood organizes information by both cell identity and by hematopoietic lineage. The validity and usability of SBR-Blood has been established through the reproduction of workflows relevant to expression data, DNA methylation, histone modifications and transcription factor occupancy profiles.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Hematopoiesis is the process by which pluripotent stem cells divide and differentiate to generate the many types of circulating blood cells. A model of the stages leading to the formation of red blood cells (erythropoiesis) and platelets (megakaryopoiesis) in the hematopoietic hierarchy is provided in Figure 1. Cells at each stage of hematopoiesis are defined by a cohort of cell surface markers. These cell surface markers can be used to isolate different populations using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). The availability of in vitro culture systems and animal models allows for a comprehensive analysis of these populations with regard to their regulation, expression, and function (1). The extensive knowledge of regulatory mechanisms in many hematopoietic cell types make hematopoiesis an excellent system in which to study regulatory correlations and their effects on systemic disorders like anemia, bone marrow failures and leukemia (2,3).  

Hematopoietic cells vary significantly in their mRNA expression, DNA methylation, and histone modification profiles (4–6). These profiles not only provide insight into the properties of the cell types, but they can also be compared against each other to infer relationships between hematopoietic lineages (subsystems). For example, correlation of RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq profiles during erythroid differentiation on a small scale showed that the protein KLF1 activates transcription in erythroblasts when bound to a target gene’s promoter region (7). Performing such analyses on a larger scale, however, requires specialized database considerations.  

Existing hematopoietic databases (Table 1) are each valuable, but they differ in their focus on specific cell types, omics applications or platform sources. Repositories such as BloodExpress (8) and ImmGen (9) allow analysis of multiple hematopoietic lineages but are restricted to expression data. The NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (10) and the ENCODE project (11) host epigenetic nextgeneration sequencing data but lack the functionality to directly compare data sets across different platforms and cell types. Efforts such as HAEMCODE (12) and CODEX (13) are compiling hematopoietic next-generation sequencing data comprehensively, along with a set of analysis tools. Their interface is experiment-driven rather than cell type focused, meaning that for comprehensive comparisons between cell types users must collect the relevant subset of experiments for further analysis. Tools currently deployed at these resources are not designed to study of correlations between different epigenetic marks or expression profiles. The BloodChIP database (14) allows for correlation between epigenetic data and expression data, but it is limited to only microarray-based expression profiles and does not allow cell type-driven analyses.  

Building on established approaches and compiled data while providing missing functionality will enable the use of hematopoietic array and sequencing data for sophisticated analyses and more detailed hypothesis generation. To do this, we developed the hematopoietic Systems Biology Repository (SBR-Blood), a database that integrates both array-based expression and epigenetic data from existing hematopoietic repositories with published and usergenerated next-generation sequencing data. SBR-Blood provides a web-interface to correlate and evaluate data associated with the various cell types and hematopoietic subsystems. By curating and normalizing the included data, SBRBlood enables cross-correlation analyses between microarray and RNA-Seq data. It also provides tools to concurrently assess changes in the methylation, histone modification, and transcription factor binding profiles. An overview of the functionality, design and data provided through the SBR-Blood database is provided in Figure 2.

A common workflow in epigenetic data analysis consists of the compilation and integration of data from multiple experiments into a single model through many format conversions, normalizations, and set operations. Our goal in designing SBR-Blood is to provide users with the ability to make informed and appropriate analytical decisions and to focus on the important biological questions relevant to hematopoiesis without having to install and master different sets of bioinformatics tools. SBR-Blood makes the underlying analytical process apparent and allows transparency of data generation and parameter settings.  

Currently, SBR-Blood content is focused on mouse hematopoietic cells, but the application is highly adaptable and can be expanded to support different organisms, biological systems, and disease states.

Figure 1. Cell types involved in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. Cells are grouped by color into lineages. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) give rise to common myeloid progenitors (CMP), which differentiate into megakaryocyte erythroid progenitors (MEP) and granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMP). GMPs give rise to the granulopoiesis lineage and MEPs to both megakaryopoiesis and erythropoiesis, which produces megakaryocytes (MEG), erythrocytes (ERY), respectively and their corresponding colony forming units (CFU).  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

SBR-Blood is designed as a three-tier web application. The first is a server-based presentation tier that allows the user to select, view and mine information stored in the repository. The second tier, the logic tier, implements the database management and query system, which operate on the third (the data tier) and are responsible for integrating the different hematopoietic datasets into a single repository. This design, common to most bioinformatics web-services, provides users with easy access to the application without concern for system requirements and availability of the database. Ensuring a very basic server infrastructure, using the common gateway interface, the Perl programming environment and the standard Perl database interface (DBI) available to Unix/Linux, Macintosh and Windows platforms, allows portability of the repository in terms of hosting requirements. By ensuring that SBR-Blood is not only open source but also compatible with a large range of data center configurations, it can be adapted to a variety of organisms, biological systems and processes.  

# Integration of existing data  

To provide a unified platform for mouse hematopoietic data, SBR-Blood incorporates the existing body of data, including microarrays and next-generation sequencing datasets (derived from RNA-Seq, Methyl-Seq, and ChIP-Seq). The database contains information from 228 experiments for $23{,}213\ \mathrm{mRNA}$ transcripts and 3227 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA). The data are broken down into 120 expression, 44 methylation, 32 transcription factor binding and 32 histone-modification assays. Each assay has various layers of relevant information that provide important metadata regarding the experiment. Expression levels and epigenetic modifications must be associated with transcripts of protein-coding mRNA and non-coding RNA. We assigned default ranges in and around genes to allow grouping of epigenetic signals into different genomic partitions relative to the transcription start and end sites of known genes (Figure 3).  

Information in the data tier is organized into five explicit layers. Each datum, represented as a measurement associated with an Ensembl transcript ID and its regulatory region (e.g. promoter or gene body), can be linked to an experimental replicate ID. In general, current experimental methodology requires several measurements for expression and intensity of an epigenetic mark in order to test the statistical significance of the observation. Each set of replicates is then associated with a specific cell type. Multiple cell types can be associated with similar experimental types (e.g. DNA methylation profiling) in order to analyze them according to a specific experimental procedure (e.g. lineage commitment or disease state).  

In addition to the required data, an experiment is also annotated with metadata describing the animal model, disease state or the sample’s tissue of origin, as well as the publication where the data are presented. Cell types may be further assigned to different hematopoietic lineages/subsystems and the sets of cell surface markers that are used to identify it. Finally, the database contains information about the genomic coordinates of transcript IDs, the targets assessed in epigenetic experiments, and the genomic partitions containing these marks.  

Microarray expression data were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (10) and the BloodExpress repository (8). RNA-Seq, epigenetic array and sequencing data were retrieved from GEO or the mouseENCODE portal (http://mouseencode.org). In order to provide concurrent expression profiles, mouseENCODE and GEO are mined for new hematopoietic data sets automatically on a monthly basis, processing newly discovered sets automatically and providing them for curation into SBR. Arraybased data were processed using the bioconductor library affy in R (23), and sequencing-based expression data were aligned using STAR (24) and profiled with the RSEM toolkit (25). Epigenetic profiles were constructed by mapping the next-generation sequencing reads using Bowtie2 (26) and peak calling using MACS (27), ERANGE (28) and SICER (29) via the SigSeeker ensemble (30).  

# Quality control annotations  

In addition to experimental quantification, SBR-Blood also assesses data quality. Array-based quality is analzyed with the MetaQC package for R (31), which uses an internal quality control index to characterize the coexpression behavior across different studies and remove potentially inconsistent experiments from the analysis. Next-generation sequencing quality is analyzed via the FastQC module (32), which provides information about the quality of individual bases (e.g. GC content) and the entire sequence (e.g. read duplication levels). Read complexity is analyzed through the samtools flagstat method (33).  

# Correlation of expression patterns with epigenetic data  

Expression and epigenetic profiles are normalized between different array-based and sequencing-based profiling approaches using the R quantile normalization technique available through the preprocessCore package (available through the CRAN repository). SBR-Blood allows users to correlate cell type expression and epigenetic profiles with each other as well as with sets of entire hematopoietic subsystems on the basis of experiment methodology or genomic locus. Correlations can be conducted using genomewide approaches or genomic partitions, and can be based on raw measurements or statistical significance. The statistical significance of internal comparison variances across measurements for cells is established using the ANOVA statistical test and a user-defined significance threshold (34). Additionally, a variety of multiple test corrections (e.g. Bonferroni or Benjamini-Hochberg) can be applied to modify the stringency of the results. Intersections and unions, computed for user-specified combinations of experimental and repository data, and controlled via various statistical thresholds, can be exported as gene lists, peak lists, or as genomic coordinates in BED format. In addition to providing sequence information about gene sets, each gene in SBRBlood is annotated with a link to its location in the UCSC Genome Browser (35) and its specific Genbank record (36).

xpression is determined by microarray andRNA-Seq expression profiles. Methylation is defined as the number of transcripts with a DNA methylation gnal in the promoter. We have annotated a complete set of 23 213 mRNA transcripts and 3227 lncRNAs based on (38).

Methylation data that could not be associated with CMP promoters (6) were chosen to generate a custom peak profile for comparison.  

# Real-time queries of user-specific data  

SBR-Blood is populated with curated published data. Users can apply the database to produce real-time correlations between their own data and these curated sets. The user supplied data are contained in a parallel data tier separated from the main repository in order to maintain database curation. The advantage of this method is that it enables correlation of user-provided data against the database and allows the use of all of SBR-Blood’s features to analyze early-stage experimental data.  

# Database content  

Currently, SBR-Blood is populated with mouse hematopoietic data, primarily from healthy C57BL/6J mice and immortalized mouse-derived cell lines. In addition to microarray expression data extracted from the BloodExpress repository, SBR-Blood also contains publicly available MethylSeq data (6), RNA-Seq expression data (37), ChIP-Seq for several transcription factors including EKLF, GATA1 and GATA2 (5,7), and Histone-Seq data representing several histone modifications (5). All hematopoietic cell types in SBR-Blood (Supplementary Table S1) are defined by cell surface marker expression and fluorescence activated cytometric sorting.  

A web interface depicting the different cell type relationships in the hematopoietic system and subsystems provides the user with the opportunity to query SBR-Blood as a straight-forward information repository. Each of the cell types in the interface can be selected and relevant expression profiles and epigenetic datasets are made available. SBRBlood correlations enable comparisons between expression and epigenetic profiles associated with specific cell types. In addition to providing population correlations, SBR-Blood provides an interface to query the database for changes in expression and epigenetic profiles of user-specified gene sets. In this process the user enters a set of gene symbols or transcript IDs and selects cell types or hematopoietic subsystems to query. Transcript information in all cases is annotated through links to respective locations and records in the UCSC Genome Browser and in Genbank.  

# Example applications  

Localized methylation mapping constructed via representation bisulfite sequencing and genome-wide mapping constructed via MBD2 pulldown, together with RNA-Seq and microarray expression, are applied in a case study describing the erythroid lineage. The cross correlation feature of SBR-Blood reveals that a subset of the cells involved in erythropoiesis (HSC, CMP, CFU-E and ERY, Figure 1) undergo an increase in overall gene expression and a decrease in promoter DNA methylation as they mature (Table 2). Furthermore, there is a strong core for both methylation and expression, meaning that very few genes pick up methylation or lose expression during the differentiation process.  

Using the dynamic correlation feature of SBR-Blood, we used a set of methylation sites identified as specifically absent in promoters of CMP by Hogart et al. (6) as an internal validation for SBR-Blood (Table 3). By showing that the methylation signals are apparent in other cell types aside from CMPs we confirmed that they were specifically demethylated in CMPs and remethylated later in the lineage. Furthermore, genes associated with promoter-specific methylation were incrementally re-methylated with increasing maturation. A similar pattern could be observed for upstream regulatory regions, while the methylation sites associated with coding and downstream regions were subjected to further demethylation in CFU-E before recovering in ERY. This indicates that cell-type specific genomic regions experience temporary changes in their epigenetic profiles.  

To evaluate individual changes in the mRNA levels of several genes during erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis, a progenitor associated gene $(K i t)$ , an erythroid gene (Slc4a1), a megakaryocyte gene $(V w f)$ and two genes involved in the regulation of both erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis (Gata1 and Gata2) were chosen to construct a user-specified SBR-Blood query (Figure 4). The levels of Gata1 mRNA and Gata2 mRNA have been shown to be inversely correlated, a process known as Gata switching (39). In agreement with these results, the level of Gata2 mRNA is highest before erythroid commitment, after which it drops off significantly, while Gata1 is lower than Gata2 during initial differentiation and experiences a subsequent increase during erythroid commitment (Figure 4). Kit is an example of a gene that is highly expressed during the early stages of differentiation but down regulated during differentiation (40). The expression of $V w f$ and Slc4a1 mRNA is consistent with their known behavior. In particular, the level of Slc4a1 mRNA is high in stem cells as well as erythroblasts and low in megakaryocytes (41), while $V w f$ mRNA levels are high in megakaryocytes and low in erythroblasts (42).  

# CONCLUSION  

SBR-Blood enables the user to conduct cell type correlations with previously published data sets and data sets currently under investigation. By reproducing concepts manually validated in the community, it has been shown to be correct in terms of functionality (using the integrated data to confirm established knowledge) and provides a useful resource for studying epigenetic profile changes during stem cell differentiation. The structure of SBR-Blood makes it highly adaptable and can support different organisms and biological systems. In particular, SBR-Blood is an excellent tool to compare transcription and epigenetic regulation profiles. The available instance of SBR-Blood is currently being expanded to support variant or disease-related hematopoiesis comparisons in mouse as well as human. This addition will provide further insights into the epigenetic regulatory changes associated with blood-related diseases.

# ABSTRACT  

Stem cell biology has experienced explosive growth over the past decade as researchers attempt to generate therapeutically relevant cell types in the laboratory. Recapitulation of endogenous developmental trajectories is a dominant paradigm in the design of directed differentiation protocols, and attempts to guide stem cell differentiation are often based explicitly on knowledge of in vivo development. Therefore, when designing protocols, stem cell biologists rely heavily upon information including (i) cell type-specific gene expression profiles, (ii) anatomical and developmental relationships between cells and tissues and (iii) signals important for progression from progenitors to target cell types. Here, we present the Stem Cell Lineage Database (SCLD) (http://scld.mcb.uconn .edu) that aims to unify this information into a single resource where users can easily store and access information about cell type gene expression, cell lineage maps and stem cell differentiation protocols for both human and mouse stem cells and endogenous developmental lineages. By establishing the SCLD, we provide scientists with a centralized location to organize access and share data, dispute and resolve contentious relationships between cell types and within lineages, uncover discriminating cell type marker panels and design directed differentiation protocols.  

# INTRODUCTION  

The field of stem cell biology and the associated data has vastly expanded as more and more researchers attempt to generate therapeutically relevant cell types in the laboratory. Because most attempts to guide stem cell differentiation are based on in vivo development (1), stem cell biologists rely heavily upon developmental biology data such as cell type-specific gene expression profiles, anatomical and developmental relationships between cells and tissues and signals important for development and differentiation of stem cells to mature cell types. This data is currently accessible through a variety of resources (Publications, Databases, etc) and formats. The SCLD aims to consolidate these three key types of information into a database providing a central resource to the stem cell community.  

Years of experimental embryology has generated large amounts of tissue-specific and cell type-specific gene expression data (2) that researchers can use to study cell types outside of their normal anatomical context. Cell type-specific gene expression profiles allow researchers to establish the identity of cells, provide insight to the developmental pathways activated in differentiating cells and monitor the progression of directed differentiation protocols. A wide variety of databases store this data and make it available to the entire research community. None, however, has the ability to compile data across existing databases and allows users to manipulate and edit the information.  

During development, embryonic and somatic stem cells progress through a series of transitional cell types ultimately resulting in terminally differentiated cells. This developmental path is often graphically represented as a cell lineage map. Stem cell biologists rely heavily on these maps as guides when designing directed differentiation protocols to mimic endogenous development in vitro. Several resources are dedicated to describing developmental relationships in a variety of model species to assist in this navigation, yet none provide a complete set of cell lineages in a format that can be readily explored and exploited by a stem cell scientist. Stem cell biologists are currently forced to amass cell lineage information piecemeal from a disparate set of sources ranging from textbooks to primary scientific literature.  

Culture conditions and environmental cues used to direct progenitor cells toward desired lineages or terminally differentiated cell types are among the most crucial pieces of information for the successful differentiation of stem cells toward useful cell types. While an enormous amount of effort has been invested in identifying these cues in vivo and in vitro, to the best of our knowledge no existing database curates this information in a computationally accessible manner. With a majority of stem cell culture protocols being founded upon our knowledge of developmental biology, ready access to this information would be extremely valuable to the stem cell community.  

A large number of databases are dedicated to supporting and disseminating gene expression data [for review, see de Boer et al. (2)]. Some of the expression databases useful to a stem cell biologist include GXD (3) from Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) at Jackson labs (4), which annotates gene expression profiles across all of mouse development. Another example is the Novartis Gene Expression Atlas (5), which stores human tissue-specific gene expression profiles. As useful as these resources are, they are designed to benefit a wide cross-section of scientists and, for this reason, cannot optimally address the specific needs of a stem cell scientist.  

One significant effort to consolidate stem cell data from across labs is the Canadian Stem Cell Network’s (6) StemBase (7), which curates, organizes and stores gene expression data from genome-wide transcript profiling experiments on mouse and human stem cells and their derivatives. While StemBase provides search and analysis tools, it does not provide the ability for users to edit the data or to curate cell types and lineages.  

Other recent data sets and databases do address a subset of these needs within specific cell lineages. The most well developed examples can be found for the hematopoietic lineage and include the HaemAtlas (8); the Erythropoiesis database (EpoDB) (9); LymphTF-DB, a database of transcription factors involved in lymphocyte development (10); Hematopoietic Fingerprints (11) and BloodExpress (12), which unite information on the entire hematopoietic lineage. Many of these databases combine lineage information with expression data in ways that would be advantageous to stem cell biologists if extended to additional lineages including musculoskeletal, pancreatic, neuronal, endodermal and cardiac as well as many others.  

Well-defined lineage maps are required to unite gene expression data with defined stages of differentiation. Several resources describing developmental and lineage relationships in the embryo are available including the Edinburgh Mouse Atlas Project (EMAP) (13), and the Expressed Sequence Annotation for Humans (eVOC) (14), among others. Typically, these projects rely upon standardized ontologies that allow for the precise description of cell types and structures in the developing embryo. One issue with the use of these ontologies for stem cell biology is an extensive reliance upon anatomical and stage-specific relationships, with a relatively minor representation of the lineage relationships most important for the design of directed differentiation protocols. Recognition of this fact led to the initiation of Cell Type ontology (CL) (15) by Bard and colleagues, which lays the groundwork for curating lineage relationships throughout the vertebrate embryo.  

Thus, no existing database brings together the data most useful to stem cell biologists in an expandable, easily accessed and annotated, user-editable interface. To address this need, we present a new resource called the Stem Cell Lineage Database (SCLD). The SCLD provides a user interface for the curation and browsing of cell type gene expression profiles, cell lineage maps and notes on the manipulations and culture conditions necessary to transition between cell types within a lineage. Our database stores information for both human and mouse cell types and lineages, is publicly accessible, directly user editable, and hyperlinked to a series of source databases, thus benefiting from the vast amounts of information presently available and maintaining consistency with current scientific nomenclature. The SCLD provides graphical lineage maps, graphical ontology building, cell type expression data and a variety of other data essential to stem cell biologists. By providing a user-editable interface for the exchange of directed differentiation protocols and sharing of stem cell research advances, the SCLD will help address the need for swift communication of new advances in the rapidly progressing field of stem cell science.  

# DESIGN OVERVIEW  

The SCLD is an internet application accessible through internet browsers (Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari) communicating to a computer server sending and retrieving data. The server contains both the application and database servers. The application server (Apache Tomcat) is the central hub that runs the SCLD. This provides web pages to users as well as controls the data being sent and retrieved to both the user and the database. The database (MySQL) is where the actual data for the SCLD is stored and maintained. Direct access to the database is not provided; instead it is accessed indirectly through the application server. Open source technologies have been used in the design, development and deployment of the SCLD. Additional information on the computational and database design can be found in the Supplementary Data.  

Stem cell research is progressing rapidly and laboratories are often working on different cell lineages making it unlikely that a centrally maintained database would be as useful or timely as an open-source counterpart. For this reason, we have designed the SCLD as a user-editable database. Users submit a request for a user account providing them the means to add/modify the data within the SCLD. Through the user accounts, users can enter and edit the cell types, markers and lineages most relevant to their own work. Researchers can also comment on cell types and lineage maps to facilitate discussion of contentious issues. This structure avoids the strict anticipation of the specific needs of independent users; each can shape the SCLD to be most beneficial to their research goals. To maintain data integrity, any data entered manually is required to have supporting evidence from a published reference(s) retrieved automatically from PubMed. In addition a history is maintained of all edits made to cell types and lineages. If necessary, previous edits can be restored for cell types and lineages.  

Using existing biological resources, the SCLD database is populated with information such as gene names, cell type names and gene expression data. This significantly reduces the barrier to the entry for the annotation of cell types and cell lineages, prevents errors associated with manual entry and provides immediate value-added information to new users. For example, gene names for both mouse and human are automatically downloaded from MGI and the Human Gene Organization (HUGO) (16), and are periodically updated to reflect the latest changes ensuring consistency among entries.  

While there are many instances where the data on cell types and lineages for mouse is similar to humans, this is not always the case. Keeping the data separated between mouse and human ensures that an accurate picture is presented for cell types and lineages for each respective species.  

# CELL TYPES  

Cell types are commonly identified by name and by the expression of a unique set of genetic markers (i.e. insulin is expressed solely in pancreatic $\upbeta$ -cells). The SCLD compiles gene expression data for cell types and allows searching for cell types by name or combination of gene markers expressed or not expressed. This search function allows researchers to efficiently identify the expression profiles of known cell types, determine which genes may be used to identify a cell type, and identify candidate cell types matching known expression profiles. When searching by name, the cell type name is either typed in or selected from the list of stored cell types (Figure 1A). Alternatively, gene markers known to be expressed or not expressed can be entered and the SCLD will produce a list of candidate cell types (Figure 1B). From either of these two searches, additional information on the cell type can be viewed including: (i) species; (ii) name and description of the cell type; (iii) gene markers used to identify the cell type; and (iv) associated publications supporting the data. Each gene marker and its corresponding reference is directly linked to MGI, HGNC or PubMed for easy access to additional information.

![](images/35c43a8919a2b81d764cec1fa6dd992ed1272067d8e8adf4e30638ab02eb0adc.jpg)  
Figure 1. Searching for cell types. (A) Search by cell type. A cell type (i.e. definitive endoderm) is selected from a list box or can be autofilled as a user enters text. Upon selecting cell type, a list of associated gene markers and the corresponding references (right side panel) will appear. (B) Search by gene marker. Gene markers (i.e. SOX17, FOXA2, etc.) are queried individually or by choosing markers linked to a cell type. Searches can be narrowed by specifying all gene markers to match (AND option), or setting a minimum threshold on the number of matches (OR option). The resulting search displays the cell types along with the matching gene markers (right side panel B).The cell types are ordered by descending number of gene marker matches.  

Along with viewing previously defined cell types [such as those in EMAP (13)], the SCLD supports editing cell types and adding new, user-defined cell types. Editing a cell type allows descriptions to be updated or gene markers and references to be added or removed. The SCLD also facilitates discussion by providing space for users to comment on all data corresponding to a cell type. Using these tools, the definition of a cell type can be modified to reflect the most current available data.  

In addition to leveraging existing databases and ontologies, we have extracted condensed cell type definitions from these ontologies that are more applicable to stem cell scientists. Because MGI is annotated as an anatomical lineage, cell types imported from Jackson labs are organized by developmental time point [Theiler stage (TS)]. This organization results in developmentally (lineally) equivalent cell types represented as multiple unique entries, one for each pertinent TS, confounding the study of a single cell type across developmental time. Using the SCLD, we combined these cell types across stages into merged cell groups in a map dubbed ‘Stage All’. This reduced the 16 000 entries from MGI into fewer than 5000 Stage All cell types (Figures 2A and B). Users can search Stage All cell types, EMAP cell types or user-defined cell types as desired (Figure 2C). In order to preserve interoperability, mapping relationships between cell types in discrete ontologies are maintained throughout and stored in the SCLD.  

EMAP also separates lineally equivalent cell types across serially homologous anatomical boundaries within the embryo (such as somites, branchial arches and fore and hind limbs). In order to group these cell types into merged cell types more representative of the lineal relationships of interest to a stem cell biologist, we developed a Python GUI called Cell Type Condenser (CTC). CTC makes use of the ‘part of’ relationships in EMAP and displays a cell type’s path from itself to the root, allowing users to easily identify developmentally equivalent cell types and condense them into a single new cell type within the database. This mapping from a single cell type to a group of cell types enables existing and new annotations to propagate from one ontology or lineage to the other. CTC is available at the SCLD website, and saved files containing mapping information can be uploaded to and processed by the SCLD.

Figure 2. Stage all cell types. (A) Three Theiler Stages 9–11 are shown for definitive endoderm. Cell types having the same names and anatomical hierarchies within each stage are merged. Definitive endoderm defines a single ‘Stage All’ cell type as it has the same name and anatomical hierarchy in all Theiler stages. (B) The cell type (i.e. definitive endoderm) is initially presented to the user as a stage all cell type and can be expanded to reveal all the constituent cell types as shown in (C).  

# LINEAGE MAPS  

Cell lineage maps represent the other major component of the SCLD. Two types of lineage maps are supported: in vivo and in vitro (see Figures 3B and 4A for examples). These maps represent lineal relationships between individual cell types that allow the user to reorder cell types from combined anatomical/developmental ontologies like EMAP into exclusively lineage-based relationships. Stored lineages are defined by the following characteristics: (i) map type (in vivo or in vitro); (ii) description, including starting and terminal cell types; and (iii) published references supporting the data (Figure 3A).  

To find, view or edit a lineage map, the SCLD supports searching based off the type of map, in vivo or in vitro, and/or any cell types contained in a map. For in vivo lineages, the SCLD can display the lineage map in a vertical (Figure 3B) or horizontal (Figure 4A) graphical format showing the cell types and their developmental trajectory from progenitor (top or left) to terminal (bottom or right). Highlighting a cell type on a lineage displays information on the gene markers and associated references for that cell type stored in the database. Gene names and references are hyperlinked to MGI, HGNC and PubMed (Figure 3C).  

As such, the SCLD lineage interface serves as a powerful and intuitive graphical ontology editor where users can access cell types mined from other databases and align them into a developmental lineage complete with gene expression profiles, transition properties, experimental manipulations required for directed differentiation and user notes.

Figure 3. Lineage map. Two types of lineage maps are supported. In this example, an in vivo bone/cartilage lineage from our case study is shown. (A) Information about the lineage map is displayed including the species, type of lineage map, starting and terminal cell types, along with supporting references used to build the lineage. (B) Lineages are displayed as graphical maps showing the progression from a starting cell type to the terminal cell types. For example, the bone/cartilage lineage begins with mesoderm and displays developmental pathways leading to its terminal cell types, cartilagenous tissue, osteoblast, articular chondrocyte and mature chondrocyte. The symbol $"\psi_{//},\psi_{}$ denotes a collapsed portion of the lineage map. (C) Selecting a cell type (i.e. sclerotome) within a lineage map displays additional information including gene markers and their associated references.  

# TRANSITION PROPERTIES  

Specific environmental cues can cause cells to divide or differentiate, or to adopt one fate over another, and this knowledge is essential for effectively guiding stem cells toward therapeutically relevant cell types for use in regenerative medicine. The relationship between cell types in a lineage includes the established ‘derives from’ or ‘develops from’ relationships, but the SCLD has the added value of including information on the amount of time, reagents, physical manipulations and other experimental criteria required for transition between cell types. As shown in the in vitro lineage map example (Figure 4), selecting a transition symbol $(<>)$ , will display the conditions used to generate the next cell type. In order to facilitate debate and discussion, any of the transition properties between cell types can be modified, added or commented on by additional users. To the best of our knowledge, in vitro lineage maps including transition properties are not curated in any other database. Ready access to this data will facilitate the comparison and optimization of difficult steps in directed differentiation protocols.  

# DATA  

To date, the SCLD is comprised of more than 50 000 gene markers and 5000 cell types supported by nearly 4400 published references (Table 1). This database was rapidly populated by utilizing gene expression profiles catalogued within existing data resources that are extensive for mouse, but less comprehensive for human cell types.  

# CASE STUDY: ANNOTATING MESODERM DEVELOPMENT  

To test the functionality of the SCLD, our laboratory curated in vivo lineage maps for the primary mesoderm-derived cell lineages outlined in Figure 5.

Figure 5. Case study: annotating in vivo mouse mesoderm development. (A) Choose lineages to be annotated. (B) Lineages were assigned to individuals for curation. (C) In each lineage, relevant cell types were identified and the corresponding gene markers entered into the SCLD based on published references. (D) Existing EMAP cell types are mapped to the individually annotated cell types (Stage All) for cross-database interoperability. The Stage All cell types are further collapsed into group cell types for easier access to gene expression data and to further reduce redundancy. (E) The next step involved the assembly of each cell type into an ordered lineage map. (F) The final step involves the SCLD users providing comments and adding to all the cell types and lineages to create a collaborative environment and to provide the most accurate lineage maps to the research community.  

Each of the seven mesodermal sub-lineages (bone, cartilage, cardiac, vascular, muscle, adipose and hematopoietic) was assigned to one lab member for curation. Referencing the primary literature, the curator established the critical cell types for their sub-lineage and updated existing relevant cell types or created new cell types with names, gene markers and references in the SCLD. Curators used Stage All cell types and the CTC to link individual EMAP cell types to specific cell types in each lineage. This allowed the SCLD to populate each cell type with known gene expression data from GXD. When available, additional markers were added from relevant publications. Then, using the lineage map editing function in the SCLD, the curator arranged the relevant cell types into a lineage map representing the major developmental transitions and decisions that occur from the mesodermal progenitor to the terminally differentiated cells in each sub-lineage.  

In total, this mapping of mesoderm development covered seven sub-lineages, 112 cell types and 242 gene expression markers, thus summarizing a significant percentage of known mesoderm cell types and developmental lineages. By establishing maps of these mesodermal sub-lineages, SCLD users can now visually explore the relationships between the major mesodermal lineages and cell types, readily access and download gene expression profiles for mesodermal progenitors and differentiated cells, easily map the mesodermal sub-lineage to major developmental ontologies, design directed differentiation protocols based upon these in vivo lineage maps, and debate and discuss the finer points of the annotated developmental relationships with other SCLD users around the world.  

This case study took approximately $5\mathrm{h}$ of data assembly, cell type curation, ontology mapping and lineage building by each of seven individuals. It should be noted that none of these individuals was an expert on the chosen lineages, and that this time investment is likely to be even smaller for experts, especially when annotating the endogenous developmental cues that comprise the in vivo transition properties (not included in the described case study).  

The very rapid manner in which data can be entered and stored for use is an indication of the low barrier to entry and the potential for true community shaping of this stem cell resource. With the support of the general stem cell community, primary literature will be quickly catalogued in the SCLD to produce a unifying reference source for all stem cell biologists.  

# DISCUSSION  

Over the past decade, stem cell biology has become one of the most rapidly advancing fields in biology generating massive amounts of experimental data. A variety of databases have been established to organize, store and distribute this data, yet no resource has been developed that brings together the key components of developmental biology most helpful to a stem cell biologist. The user-friendly SCLD provides the stem cell field with a customizable framework to easily edit and navigate gene expression data, lineal relationships and transition properties between cell types. Its power lies in the ability to rapidly and effectively construct developmental lineages relevant to the user and serve as the basis for hypothesis building and experimental design as demonstrated by our case study.  

# FUTURE DIRECTIONS  

We will continue to expand the SCLD’s compatibility so that we can utilize future cell type ontologies, genome-wide expression databases and literature sources and maintain the most current data in the database. Another important goal will be programming the automatic extraction of unique marker profiles for specific cell types with estimates of discriminative power to aid in in vitro cell type identification. Along these lines, we plan to provide an API providing direct read-only access to the database. This will provide better integration and interoperability among current biological databases as well as providing an interface allowing users to write bioinformatic programs to analyze the data according to their own needs. We also intend to implement private lab-specific domains that will allow users to manipulate their data in the SCLD and store proprietary data until publication. Finally, we expect to expand the user communication and annotation functions of the SCLD in order to facilitate discussion between scientists researching complementary problems. This will include automatic flagging of related lineages and apparent conflicts between related cell types and lineages to exploit the power of social networking between investigators for resolving persistent areas of uncertainty.

# ABSTRACT  

Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are a superfamily of $\mathsf{C a^{2+}}$ -permeable cation channels that translate cellular stimuli into electrochemical signals. Aberrant activity of TRP channels has been implicated in a variety of human diseases, such as neurological disorders, cardiovascular disease and cancer. To facilitate the understanding of the molecular network by which TRP channels are associated with biological and disease processes, we have developed the TRIP (TRansient receptor potential channel-Interacting Protein) Database (http://www.trpchannel.org), a manually curated database that aims to offer comprehensive information on protein–protein interactions (PPIs) of mammalian TRP channels. The TRIP Database was created by systematically curating 277 peerreviewed literature; the current version documents 490 PPI pairs, 28 TRP channels and 297 cellular proteins. The TRIP Database provides a detailed summary of PPI data that fit into four categories: screening, validation, characterization and functional consequence. Users can find in-depth information specified in the literature on relevant analytical methods and experimental resources, such as gene constructs and cell/tissue types. The TRIP Database has user-friendly web interfaces with helpful features, including a search engine, an interaction map and a function for cross-referencing useful external databases. Our TRIP Database will provide a valuable tool to assist in understanding the molecular regulatory network of TRP channels.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are a large family of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ -permeable cation channels that encompass 28 isotypes in mammals (1–5). The TRP channel superfamily is divided into six subfamilies (1–5): TRPC (canonical), TRPV (vanilloid), TRPM (melastatin), TRPP (polycystin), TRPML (mucolipin) and TRPA (ankyrin). TRP channels convert a wide range of environmental stimuli into electrochemical signals via membrane potential and intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ . These common transductions play crucial roles in many physiological processes (6–8). A detailed explanation of the role of TRP channels in physiology is beyond the scope of this paper, and the reader is referred to the excellent review articles found in refs (1–8) and ‘Further Reading’ on the main page of the TRIP Database website.  

Accumulating evidence indicates that aberrant TRP channels have causal roles in various human diseases. Mutations in these channels are increasingly linked to genetic disorders, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, mucolipidosis type IV and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (9,10). In addition, deregulation of TRP channel activity is associated with various human diseases, including neurological disorders, cardiovascular disease and cancer (11–13). Furthermore, studies of mice with ablated TRP channels provide insight into the relationship between TRP channel functionality and disease processes (14,15). Thus, TRP channels would make attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. However, the molecular mechanisms by which TRP channels are involved in the diseases are largely unknown.  

Most proteins form complexes to achieve specific functions in virtually all biological systems. Correctly identifying and characterizing the protein–protein interactions (PPIs) and the networks they comprise within these complexes are crucial for understanding the molecular mechanisms determining biological phenomena and disease processes (16–20). Recently, PPI interfaces have emerged as promising drug targets (21). In addition, the PPI data gathered comprise frameworks for system-based drug discovery (22–23). In the field of TRP channel research, the publication of PPI papers has markedly increased in recent years (Supplementary Figure S1). Therefore, there is a need to map the molecular landscape of TRP channel PPIs to assist those seeking to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms by which TRP channels are associated with a variety of diseases. However, the ongoing accumulation of information on TRP channel PPIs is scattered.  

Enormous information on the global PPI network is hosted by several existing PPI databases, such as DIP (24), IntAct (25), MINT (26), STRING (27) and BioGRID (28). However, these databases do not provide sufficient information to scientists who want to focus their research on particular protein families. Thus, it is desirable to construct databases that contain detailed information on relevant analytical methods, experimental resources and summarized results. Such PPI databases can provide in-depth information on specific molecules or molecule families and will be more effective than the present global PPI network in stimulating the formulation of new knowledge, hypotheses or experiments.  

Here, we present the TRIP (TRansient receptor potential channel-Interacting Protein) Database, a manually curated database that aims to provide comprehensive information on PPIs of mammalian TRP channels. The TRIP Database can be accessed at http://www.trpchannel.org.  

# CONTENTS AND DESIGN  

The current version of the TRIP Database documents 490 PPI pairs among 28 TRP channels and 297 cellular proteins (Supplementary Figures S2 and S3). We selected 277 peer-reviewed articles on TRP channel PPIs from a pool of more than 500 to serve as the source of information for the database. An overview of the information described in each article is presented in the form of a matrix (Figure 1). Based on common research schemes of PPI studies (29), columns are labeled with the following categorizations: screening, validation, characterization and functional consequence (Supplementary Table S1). These categorizations give answers to four basic questions about PPIs: how to identify PPIs (screening); how to confirm PPIs (validation); what are the biochemical properties of PPIs (characterization); what is the biological meaning of PPIs (functional consequence). Each category is assigned to the brief summary of experimental results or the information on experimental resources (e.g. gene constructs and cell/tissue types). Rows are labeled with relevant analytical methods as described in the literature (29,30). Based on the information in the ‘Materials and Methods’ section of each paper, we listed 15 analytical methods used to obtain PPI data (Figure 1).

In addition, the TRIP Database provides information on the amino acid sequences of TRP channels and their interacting proteins, which is retrieved from the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and UniProtKB/TrEMBL databases (31) and available as FASTA, EMBL and GenBank formats (Supplementary Figure S4).  

Screening refers to the type of high-throughput experimental methods (i.e. yeast two-hybrid screens or affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry) used to identify the TRP channel-interacting proteins (interactors). Because TRP channels are almost exclusively used as baits in the experiments, we include information on the TRP channel constructs and the target sample sources with regard to species, organ/tissue and sample types as specified in the literature. In addition, we curated the substantial number of TRP channel PPIs discovered by speculation, inference or other non-experimental methods under the category of screening.  

Validation is classified either as in vitro or in vivo depending on the experimental techniques used to validate PPIs. In vitro validation refers to the methods that use assays with the recombinant proteins encoded by either TRP channels and/or their interactors (e.g. fusion protein pull-down assays), whereas in vivo validation represents those processes that use assays with endogenous proteins (i.e. assays without transfection) or overexpressed proteins (i.e. assays with transfection). The TRIP Database provides a detailed summary of experimental resources, including the gene constructs and expression systems used for recombinant protein preparation and cell/tissue types.  

Characterization refers to the data on the biochemical properties of PPIs, such as binding region mapping, stoichiometry or affinity among interacting proteins as specified in the articles. We curated the mapping data for binding regions with regard to the gene constructs used and amino acid region (e.g. 1–324). In the TRIP Database, stoichiometry is described in quantitative terms (i.e. binding ratio), and affinity is defined by a dissociation constant (i.e. $K_{\mathrm{d}}\mathrm{\Omega}$ ).  

Because activity of TRP channels is usually modulated by the changes in post-translational modification (PTM) or subcellular trafficking, we classified the functional consequences described in each article into three subcategories: PTM, subcellular trafficking and activity. We curated the information described in the articles on PTM and subcellular trafficking with regard to the types of PTM (e.g. phosphorylation) and the changes in subcellular trafficking of TRP channels, respectively. In addition, we briefly summarize the experimental results concerning the changes of TRP channel activity.  

# IMPLEMENTATION  

# Data collection  

The literature on TRP channel PPIs found in the PubMed database serve as the primary information source for constructing the TRIP Database. First, a list of synonyms for the term ‘TRP channels’ was constructed from UniprotKB, Entrez Gene (32), membrane protein databases (Supplementary Table S2) and published review papers for nomenclature (33,34). Second, using these synonyms, a list of articles was obtained through a PubMed search. Third, salient articles were collected through a survey of PubMed abstracts and subsequently by search of full-text papers. Finally, we selected articles that contain evidence for physical binding among the proteins denoted. To prevent omission of relevant papers, we manually screened information in other databases, such as DIP, IntAct, MINT, STRING, BioGRID, Entrez Gene, IUPHAR-DB (35) and ISI Web of Knowledge (from Thomson Reuters). All 277 articles used for database construction are listed in our database website (Supplementary Figure S5). Every entry in our database has corresponding articles for those interested in seeking further information.  

# Data curation  

We curated the data based on analytical methods, experimental results, resources (e.g. genes or proteins, primary cells, tissues and cell lines) and nomenclature. The curation of analytical methods and experimental results was partly described in the earlier section on categorization (see the ‘Contents and design’ section). Regarding nomenclature to describe analytical methods (Figure 1), we employ popularly used names in the papers. However, the names of two methods are arbitrarily designated; one is fusion protein pull down assay, which includes the assays using the recombinant proteins fused with GST, histidine hexamer or other peptide tags; the other is fluorescence probe labeling, which represents the assays using protein labeled with various fluorescence probes.  

We manually curated the information on the gene constructs denoted in the literature with respect to species (e.g. mouse) and amino acid region (e.g. 1–324). As with regard to nomenclature to describe the proteins, we adopt common names that are widely used in the literature. If information on the gene constructs was not found in the literature, but relevant references were provided, we gathered information from referenced articles. However, if no appropriate data were available, it is designated as ‘Not specified’ in the TRIP Database.  

We also curated nomenclatures for the primary cells, tissues and cell lines used in the validation of TRP channel PPIs. Because the nomenclatures describing primary cells or tissues are mostly unified, we faithfully cited primary cell or tissue names designated in the literature texts. Contrastingly, because the nomenclatures delineating cell lines have not been standardized (36), we sometimes, as previously described, modified the corresponding names by referring to the CLDB (37) and ATCC databases (36).  

# Database construction and web interface development  

The data contained in the TRIP Database are stored on a carefully designed relational database on a MySQL server (version 5.1.41). The web interfaces to the database were developed using XHTML 1.1, CSS, Javascript and Ruby on Rails 2.3.8 technologies. The web application runs on a  

Phusion Passenger application server (version 2.2.15) with an Apache HTTP server (version 2.2.14) hosted on an Ubuntu Linux server (version 10.0.4 LTS). The web-based visualization tool of the TRIP Database was developed using Adobe Flex 4 SDK and Flare, an open-source data visualization library for Adobe Flash Player.  

# WEB INTERFACES  

The TRIP Database has user-friendly interfaces with several helpful features, including a search engine, an interaction map and a tool that cross-references other useful external databases. Navigation of the TRIP Database is illustrated in Figure 2, and the website also provides instruction in the ‘Tutorial’ section (see also Supplementary Figure S6). Users can browse the database based on TRP channel subfamilies or isotypes. If users choose to begin their search based on a specific TRP channel subfamily, they will get a summary of the subfamily, including information on isotypes, amino acid sequences or UniprotKB IDs. If users choose to browse based on a specific TRP channel isotype, they will see lists of TRP channel PPI pairs. For example, the interface might provide one TRP channel with all of its interactors whereas in another instance all TRP channels with one interactor.  

# Search  

The TRIP Database provides full-text search capability on proteins, PPIs and relevant literature (Supplementary Figure S7 and Tutorial 5 on our website). When a user enters a query (i.e. protein names or UniprotKB IDs) into the search form, the system presents corresponding information on all proteins and PPI pairs. In addition, the system can provide a list of indexed entries that contain the search word in the title, author, affiliation or abstract.  

# Interaction map  

The TRIP Database provides a visualization tool that graphically displays the network of TRP channel PPIs. Proteins are represented as round-shaped nodes labeled with their names, and PPIs are illustrated as edges connecting the protein nodes (Supplementary Figure S8). By clicking the nodes, users can highlight all PPI pairs generated by a particular protein. Detailed information of a PPI can be obtained by double-clicking the representative node. A control panel on the left side of the toolbar allows users to choose TRP channel subfamilies and PPI categories.  

# External links  

In order to complement the TRIP Database and provide additional information on each gene contained in the TRIP Database, we provide hyperlinks to other useful databases (Supplementary Table S3), including UinprotKB, DIP, IntAct, MINT, STRING, BioGRID, Entrez Gene, IUPHAR-DB, KEGG (38) and OMIM (39). Thus, the TRIP Database works as a central hub for the collection of structural, functional, pharmacological and pathophysiological information on TRP channels and their PPIs.

# DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS  

The TRIP Database provides extensive information about TRP channels and their interactions with cellular proteins that allows for in-depth characterization of the molecular network of TRP channels. This database is manually curated and presently contains 490 PPI pair entries. Automated data collection and curation via machine learning techniques often include extraneous data or omit desirable data; therefore, manual curation is currently the best method for constructing reliable biological databases. The superiority of manual curation becomes more obvious when comparing PPI databases (Supplementary Table S4). Compared to our TRIP Database, considerable information on TRP channel PPIs are omitted in other experimentally verified PPI databases. On the other hand, the curator is also able to include all the detailed information, such as species of genes, regions on proteins, or cell/tissue types. Therefore, the TRIP Database will be a useful, convenient and accurate resource for research on TRP channels.  

Looking forward, there are several challenges for the TRIP Database. First, a wiki page will be added onto the TRIP Database website to encourage researcher participation. Researchers will be able to comment, add new information or revise the entries in the TRIP Database. We hope to improve the TRIP Database through the collaborating participation of other researchers. Next, we will develop machine learning techniques to cluster new meaningful protein complexes and predict new PPIs. This will stimulate the possible formulation of new hypotheses for the novel role of TRP channels in physiology and provide an integrated view of TRP channel biology. Lastly, we hope to propose a standard format to describe information on TRP channel PPIs. As far as we know, currently there is no standard format to describe information on TRP channel PPIs. The proposed standardized format will aid researchers to exchange or explain their works more effectively and efficiently.

# ABSTRACT  

Drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) are critical determinant of drug safety and efficacy, and the interactome of DMEs has attracted extensive attention. There are 3 major interaction types in an interactome: microbiome–DME interaction (MICBIO), xenobiotics– DME interaction (XEOTIC) and host protein–DME interaction (HOSPPI). The interaction data of each type are essential for drug metabolism, and the collective consideration of multiple types has implication for the future practice of precision medicine. However, no database was designed to systematically provide the data of all types of DME interactions. Here, a database of the Interactome of Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes (INTEDE) was therefore constructed to offer these interaction data. First, 1047 unique DMEs (448 host and 599 microbial) were confirmed, for the first time, using their metabolizing drugs. Second, for these newly confirmed DMEs, all types of their interactions (3359 MICBIOs between 225 microbial species and 185 DMEs; 47 778 XEOTICs between 4150 xenobiotics and 501 DMEs; 7849 HOSPPIs between 565 human proteins and 566 DMEs) were comprehensively collected and then provided, which enabled the crosstalk analysis among multiple types. Because of the huge amount of accumulated data, the INTEDE made it possible to generalize key features for revealing disease etiology and optimizing clinical treatment. INTEDE is freely accessible at: https://idrblab.org/intede/

# INTRODUCTION  

Drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) transform the parent drug to a metabolite with substantially different physicochemical and pharmacological properties, and are critical determinants of drug safety and efficacy (1,2). The interactome of DMEs has therefore attracted considerable attention (3–12). There are three major types of interactions: (i) microbiome–DME interactions (MICBIOs) determining the dynamic nature (5) and interpersonal variability (6) of drug metabolism; (ii) host protein–DME interactions (HOSPPIs) essential for predicting in vivo efficacy or clearance based on in vitro result (7) and revealing the mechanism underlying drug resistance (8) or adverse drug reaction (9); (iii) xenobiotics–DME interactions (XEOTICs) that are the key factor of metabolism-based drug–drug interaction (5) and a constant inspiration of clinical treatment optimization (10). Because the metabolism of drugs is collectively determined by multiple types of interactions, the accumulation of DME interactome data may give vital insight into the prediction of clinical consequences (7) and will have implication for the future practice of precision medicine (5).  

![](images/303698e91ad91634e37846d71b8a892adae12c76867a08327667d075ad3328aa.jpg)  
Figure 1. INTEDE statistics of (i) the DMEs, and their corresponding drug(s) and tissue/disease specific protein abundances (orange) and (ii) three types of DME interactions: MICBIOs (green), HOSPPIs (blue) and XEOTICs (red). MICBIO determines the evolving and dynamic nature of metabolizing capacity and the interpersonal variability of drug metabolism; HOSPPI is essential for predicting in vivo efficacy/clearance based on the in vitro data, and revealing the mechanisms underlying drug resistance and toxicity; XEOTIC is one of the leading factors of the metabolism-based drug-drug interaction and the constant inspiration of clinical treatment optimization.  

Moreover, because of its dynamic evolvements (5), wide distribution (13), and rich repository of enzymes (14), the microbiome and its DMEs are found to be not only as critical as human DMEs in drug metabolism (10), but also key in the study of individual or tissue-specific metabolism of drugs (13,14) and the discovery of novel therapeutics targeting microbial protein (10). As a result, there was an explosive growth of interest in studying the interactome of microbial DME (15–19). Particularly, the MICBIO between actinobacteria Eggerthella lenta and microbial DME tyrosine decarboxylases was found to collectively regulate the metabolism of levodopa (10); the HOSPPI between host UDP-glucuronosyltransferases and microbial DME beta-glucuronidases could lead to an adverse drug reaction of irinotecan (20); the XEOTIC between antibiotic ciprofloxacin and bacterial DME cytidine deaminase was discovered to abrogate the resistance of gemcitabine (21). Thus, it is important to collect these interactome data, and collectively analyze the multiple types of interactions for not only human but also microbial DMEs (7,10,15).  

Nowadays, various databases have been developed to provide DME-related data, the majority of which are freely accessible and remain active. Some of these databases (such as DrugBank (22), PDB (23), PharmGKB (24), Protein Atlas (25), TTD (26) and UniProt (27)) provide the enzyme or DME information as part of a broader collection of biological/pharmacological data, and some others (including BRENDA (28), KEGG (29), MetaCyc (30), Reactome (31), SMPDB (32) and VMH (33)) contain the general enzymatic classifications or metabolic reaction/pathway data for a comprehensive set of enzymes. Since all these databases do not include DME interactome data, some databases have been designed to provide the interactions between ${\sim}2800$ xenobiotics and ${\sim}190$ DMEs (including CTD (34),  

T3DB (35) and Transformer (36)). However, no database has been designed to describe the key role of microbial DME in drug metabolism, and the interaction data of neither microbiome (MICBIO) nor host protein (HOSPPI), that alter drug metabolism by affecting human/microbial DME, are provided in any available knowledge base. As the crosstalk among interaction types is crucial for drug metabolism (7,10,15), it is critical to construct a database that comprehensively describes all three types of DME interactions.  

Here, a newly developed database, Interactome of DrugMetabolizing Enzyme (INTEDE) was therefore introduced. First, a comprehensive literature review of all $(>1900)$ drugs approved by U.S. FDA and ${>}3000$ drugs in clinical trial or preclinical research was performed. Different from the small amount of DMEs $(\sim30)$ that were officially described in the U.S. FDA guidance (37,38), 553 DMEs (241 and 312 from human and microbiome, respectively) were confirmed in INTEDE to metabolize approved drugs, 421 DMEs (188 from human and 233 from microbiome) were to metabolize the drug in clinical or preclinical test, and 494 DMEs (208 from human and 286 from microbiome) were to metabolize the pharmaceutically investigative agents. Second, for all these newly confirmed DMEs, INTEDE comprehensively provided all three types of their interactions (MICBIOs, HOSPPIs and XEOTICs, as shown in Figure 1), which allowed the crosstalk among multiple interaction types (7,10,15) and could thus facilitate the study of disease etiology and the optimization of clinical treatment. All in all, since such crosstalk is key for drug metabolism, the INTEDE is expected to have implications for the future practice of precision medicine.  

# FACTUAL CONTENT AND DATA RETRIEVAL  

# Confirmation and collection of human/microbial DMEs  

The DMEs collected in INTEDE were first confirmed by the drugs of clinical importance (either approved or clinical/preclinical/investigative). Particularly, a comprehensive literature review of all drugs approved by FDA (1921 in total, collected from the U.S. FDA official site), 2958 drugs in clinical trial (data from the ClinicalTrial.gov (39) and TTD (40)) and 10 213 pharmaceutically investigative agents (obtained from the TTD (40)), was performed to confirm their corresponding DMEs by searching the PubMed (41) using such keyword combinations as “Drug Name’ $^+$ drug metabolizing enzyme’, “Drug Name’ $^+$ metabolism’, “Drug Name’ $^+$ enzyme’, “Drug Name’ $^+$ drug metabolism’ and “Drug Name’ $^+$ metabolized’. Moreover, to facilitate the discovery of microbial DMEs, ${>}2000$ microbial species (from bacteria, fungi, metamonada, amoebozoa and archaea (3,42,43)) colonizing throughout the human body (such as bladder, blood, eye, gut, lung, oral cavity, skin, stomach, urethra and vagina (44–46)) were collected, and the microbial DMEs were then discovered by the literature review of PubMed (41) using such keyword combinations as “Species Name’ $^+$ ‘Drug Name”, “Species Name’ $^+$ drug metabolism’, “Species Name’ $^+$ drug metabolized’ and “Species Name’ $^+$ metabolizing enzyme’.  

As a result, 553 DMEs (241 host and 312 microbial) were identified to metabolize 924 approved drugs, 421 DMEs (188 host and 233 microbial) were to metabolize 560 drugs in preclinical and clinical, and 494 DMEs (208 host and 286 microbial) were to metabolize 405 pharmaceutically investigative agents. In total, there were 1047 unique DMEs in INTEDE (448 from human and 599 from microbes). On one hand, 448 human DMEs were grouped to diverse enzymatic families (43 families in total defined by the second level of the Enzyme Commission (EC) nomenclature (28)), and the Top-5 popular DME families were: Paired Donor Oxidoreductase (EC: 1.14, 67 DMEs), CHOH Donor Oxidoreductase (EC: 1.1, 47 DMEs), Ester Bond Hydrolase (EC: 3.1, 41 DMEs), Glycosyltransferase (EC: 2.4, 34 DMEs) and Kinase (EC:2.7, 32 DMEs). On the other hand, 599 microbial DMEs also belonged to diverse enzymatic families (29 families in total defined by the second level of EC nomenclature), and the Top-5 popular DME families were: Carbon-Nitrogen Hydrolase (EC: 3.5, 99 DMEs), Glycosylase (EC: 3.2, 91 DMEs), Paired Donor Oxidoreductase (EC: 1.14, 33 DMEs), CH-NH Donor Oxidoreductase (EC: 1.5, 31 DMEs), and Acyltransferase (EC: 2.3, 20 DMEs). Experimentally assessed kinetic parameters $(K m)$ and catalytic efficiencies (Kcat/Km) between 235 drugs and 190 human/microbial DMEs were also offered. As shown in Figure 2, a full list of drugs metabolized by certain DME were displayed in INTEDE.  

# Tissue and disease specific protein sbundances of DMEs  

Tissue and disease specific DME abundances are critical for the mitigation of drug toxic reaction (47) and alteration of drug pharmacokinetics (48). In particular, tissue specific DME abundances can not only maintain the functional homeostasis of drug, but also mitigate their tissue-dependent adverse reactions, such as cardiotoxicity, nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity (47); the variations in DME abundances among different disease indications (such as infection, immunodeficiency and inflammation) can significantly affect hepatic/renal clearance, and therefore reduce drug efficacy or aggravate adverse drug reaction (48). Since these tissue/disease-dependent variations in DME abundances were expected to provide new therapeutic strategies (49–52), the relevant data should be accumulated and further analyzed to promote modern drug discovery.  

Disease specific DME abundance data were collected as follows, the detailed procedure of which was illustrated in Supplementary Method S1. First, 5304 series records from the same microarray platform (Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2.0) were gathered from the Gene Expression Omnibus (53). Second, the collected records were sequentially processed by data normalization, transformation, integration, perfect match correction, quantile, robust multiarray average and median polish (54). Third, the differential expression analysis (55) was conducted by comparing the DME abundance among sample groups (defined in Supplementary Method S1). Fourth, the violin-plot describing the differential expression pattern of the studied DMEs among sample groups was drawn (shown in Supplementary Figure S1). Furthermore, tissue specific DME abundances data were collected using the following procedure, and the detailed process was elaborated in Supplementary Method S1.

Figure 2. A typical INTEDE page providing the details of DME, which included: (i) the general information (DME name, EC nomenclature, taxonomy lineage, hyperlink to detailed interactome and molecular or functional data); (ii) the full list of drugs metabolized by this DME (categorized based on clinical status: FDA approved, clinical, preclinical, investigative and discontinued. By clicking on each category, the detail information of each drug can be viewed); (iii) the tissue and disease specific protein abundance of the DME (the differential abundance profiles of 394 DMEs in 60 tissues and 106 diseases, and the expression profiles of 348 DMEs across 36 human tissues).  

First, a benchmark dataset that contained the protein expression data across 36 human tissues (56) was collected. Second, the intensities of each DME were processed via data integration and scaling. Third, the expression bar plot of studied DME across 36 tissues was drawn (Supplementary Figure S2). Overall, the differential abundance profile of 394 DMEs in 20,663 patients and healthy individuals of 60 tissues and 106 diseases, and the expression profile of 348 DMEs across 36 human tissues were provided in and downloadable from the website. As shown in Figure 2, the tissue and disease specific DME abundances were described.  

# The interactome of human and microbial DMEs  

INTEDE comprehensively provided all three types of DME interaction data (as shown in Figure 1) for those 1047 unique DMEs (448 from human and 599 from microbe) confirmed in previous section. These interaction data included: (i) microbiome–DME interactions (MICBIOs); (ii) host protein–DME interactions (HOSPPIs) and (iii) xenobiotics–DME interactions (XEOTICs).  

Interactions between microbiome and DMEs. The microbial manipulation of drug metabolism by interacting with DME is characterized by (i) the vast diversity of involved microbial species (including various bacteria or fungi from dozens of taxonomic phyla (6,10,20,21,57–59)) and (ii) the wide distribution of these species throughout the human body (not only in gut, but also in skin, vagina, and many other sites (17,21,44,60–62)). Since the microbiome-DME interactions (MICBIOs) are key in determining the dynamic feature (5) and interpersonal variability (6) of drug metabolism, it is very essential to have the MICBIOs data for understanding the controls/effects of the circadian timing system (63) and individualized microbiota compositions (21,61) on the metabolism of certain medication (Figure 1).  

Because the MICBIOs data were largely dispersed in literatures, PubMed database (41) was first searched to find the interactions between microbiome and human/microbial DMEs. In particular, the keyword combinations of “Microbial Species Name’ $^+$ ‘DME Name”, “Species Name’ $^+$ ‘Drug Name” and “Species Name’ $^+$ drug metabolism’ were used in literature reviews, and the discovered publications were manually assessed for retrieving any MICBIOsrelated information. Moreover, due to the collective determination by multiple factors present in a drug delivery route (64), the metabolism of a drug should be assessed by simultaneously considering its DME(s) and the colonizing microbes, if both DME and microbe are involved in the same route (64). Therefore, additional literature reviews were then conducted using the keyword combination of “Microbial Species Name’ $^+$ ‘DME Name’ $^+$ ‘Drug Name”. The studies that describe the DME and microbe that metabolized the same drug and present in the same delivery route were identified, and these publications were also manually evaluated for retrieving the MICBIOs-related data.  

As a result, the collected data included the taxonomic lineage of each microbe (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species), the human body site distributed by each microbe (bladder, blood, eye, gut, lung, oral cavity, skin, stomach, urethra and vagina), the list of drugs affected by the interaction between microbial species and DME, and the mechanism of how drug metabolism is influenced by the corresponding interactions. All in all, the latest version of INTEDE contained 3359 MICBIOs between 225 microbes and 185 human/microbial DMEs. These microbes came from 3 kingdoms, 19 phyla, 31 classes, 40 orders, 69 families and 107 genera as defined by the NCBI Taxonomy database (65), and colonized in 10 different human body sites (such as: bladder, blood, eye, gut, lung, oral cavity, skin, stomach, urethra and vagina). The MICBIOs data can be assessed and retrieved by various search strategies in both the Home page and the subpage entitled ‘Microbiome-DME interaction’ of INTEDE (as shown in Figure 3).

Host protein–DME interactions (HOSPPIs) were frequently encountered in drug metabolism, and widely acknowledged to be critical determinant of drug safety and efficacy (7–9,66– 69). A variety of HOSPPIs were of great interest in recent metabolic study, which included (i) oligomerizations that are essential for predicting in vivo drug efficacy or clearance based on the in vitro results (7), (ii) transcription factor regulations that are critical for revealing the mechanisms underlying drug resistance (8) and metabolic variation (70,71), (iii) epigenetic regulations (like DNA methylations, histone modifications and non-coding RNA regulations) that lead to inter-individual variability in drug responses and adverse reactions, and highlight the implications for personalized medicine (9,72,73). Furthermore, the effects of HOSPPIs on altering the drug metabolisms varied between healthy and pathological condition, and differed among disease indications (74). It was therefore essential to collect HOSPPIs to facilitate the prediction of clinical consequence (Figure 1).  

The HOSPPIs data was identified by literature search using different keyword combinations. For example, when searching for the oligomerization of a DME, “DME Name’ $^+$ oligomer’, “DME Name’ $^+$ oligomerization’, “DME Name’ $^+$ dimer’, “DME Name’ $^+$ trimer’, “DME Name’ $^+$ dimerization’, “DME Name’ $^+$ trimerization’ and “DME Name’ $^+$ protein-protein interaction’ were used; when discovering the transcription factor regulations on a DME, ‘transcription factor $^+$ ‘DME Name” and ‘transcriptional regulation $^+$ ‘DME Name” were reviewed; when finding the DNA methylations of a DME, “DME Name’ $^+$ methylation’, “DME Name’ $^+$ epigenetics’ and “DME Name’ $^+$ methylate’ were searched. Moreover, the additional DNA methylation data for all DMEs in INTEDE were further collected using the following processes. First, 1377 series records of a very popular microarray platform (Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip) were collected from the Gene Expression Omnibus (53), and 136 series records with both patients and healthy individuals data were selected, which contained 16 256 samples of 86 disease indications. Second, all these collected records were sequentially processed by quality control, normalization and batch effect correction (75–78), and differential methylations were discovered by calculating both $P$ -values and delta-beta values (79,80). According to the definition in previous reports, the threshold of $P$ -values was set to 0.05 ( $P$ -value $<0.05$ was considered to be statistically significant (79)), and the cutoff of delta-beta values was set to 0.2 and 0.3 (the absolute value of delta-beta ${>}0.3$ was considered as ‘significant methylation’ (79), and $0.3\geq$ |delta-beta| $>0.2$ was reported as ‘moderate methylation’ (80)). Third, the above differential methylations were discovered among four different sample groups, which included: (i) DME methylation in the normal tissue adjacent to the disease tissue of patients (blue), (ii) DME methylation in the disease tissue of patients (red), (iii) DME methylation in the normal tissue of healthy individual (green) and (iv) DME methylation in the tissue other than the disease tissue of patients (yellow). Fourth, the methylation plot across samples was drawn using ggplot2 in $R$ environment, and the violin plots of methylation variation between two studied groups was generated using ggplot2 and ggbeeswarm in $R$ All plots can be viewed online (Supplementary Figure S3) and downloaded from the website.  

Consequently, the HOSPPI information included the interaction types (oligomerization, transcription factor regulation, DNA methylation and drug co-metabolism), the studied diseases (95 diseases standardized in a latest version of International Classification of Diseases (81), ICD11), the targeted cell lines (289 cell lines, such as A549, Caco-2, HEK293, HepG2 and MCF-7), the levels of DNA methylation (significant or moderate) together with the corresponding $P$ -value and delta-beta value, the drugs which metabolism was affected by studied HOSPPIs, the detailed mechanism of a HOSPPI on drug metabolism, and the violin/bar plots illustrating the differential methylation between different sample groups. All in all, INTEDE contained 7849 HOSPPIs between 565 host proteins and 566 DMEs: oligomerization (homo-/hetero-), transcription factor regulation (activation/repression), DNA methylation (hypo-/hyper-), drug co-metabolism (direct/indirect). HOSPPIs data can be assessed in INTEDE (Figure 4).

Figure 3. A typical INTEDE page offering the data of microbiome-DME interaction (MICBIO). The INTEDE contained 3359 MICBIOs between 225 microbes and 185 DMEs. These microbes came from 3 kingdoms, 19 phyla, 69 families and 107 genera, and colonized in 10 different host body sites (bladder, blood, eye, gut, lung, oral cavity, skin, stomach, urethra and vagina).  

Interactions between xenobiotics and DMEs. The activity or expression of DMEs could be inhibited or induced by xenobiotics, which, in turn, affected the hepatic clearance of drug and led to the reduced efficacy and therapeutic failure (82–85). These xenobiotics included: (i) pharmaceutical agents (FDA approved, clinical, preclinical, patented and investigative), (ii) health toxicants (biotoxin, carcinogen, environmental pollutant, mycotoxin, and neurotoxin), (iii) natural substances (biological extract, natural product/mixture and traditional medicine), (iv) agricultural chemicals (fungicides, herbicides and insecticide), (v) additive agents (food additives and cosmetic additives) and (vi) proteins/peptides. Since all these xenobiotics are one of the leading factors of the metabolism-based drug–drug interactions (5) and the constant inspiration of clinical treatment optimizations (10), it was essential to collect those xenobiotics-DME interactions (XEOTICs), and clarify the effects of an XEOTIC on modulating the activity or expression of human/microbial DMEs.  

Therefore, the XEOTIC data were systematically searched by literature review in PubMed based on the keyword combinations between ‘DME Name’ and ‘biotoxin’, ‘environmental pollutant’, ‘extract’, ‘fungicides’, ‘inducer’, ‘inhibitor’, ‘insecticides’, ‘nature product’ and ‘pesticides’. Those discovered literatures were evaluated manually to identify the xenobiotics affecting DMEs. The collected data included the name of xenobiotics, the modulation types (inducer and inhibitor), the xenobiotic classifications (additive, agricultural chemical, health toxicant, natural substance, and pharmaceutical agent), the modulation activity (measured by MIC/IC50/Ki values), and the affected cell system (choriocarcinoma, hamster ovary, and high five). All in all, the INTEDE provided 47,778 XEOTICs between 4150 xenobiotics and 501 human or microbial DMEs. These miscellaneous xenobiotics cover all the xenobiotic types described in the previous paragraph (from (i) pharmaceutical agents to (vi) proteins/peptides).

Figure 4. A typical INTEDE page offering the data of host protein-DME interactions (HOSPPIs). The INTEDE contained 7849 HOSPPIs between 565 host proteins and 566 DMEs. Various types of HOSPPI were in the INTEDE, which included: oligomerization (homo-/hetero-), transcription factor regulation (activation/repression), and DNA methylation (hypo-/hyper-).  

All XEOTICs can be assessed in the subpage of INTEDE entitled ‘Xenobiotics-DME Interaction’ (Figure 5).  

# Data standardization, access and retrieval  

To make the access and analysis of INTEDE data convenient for all users, the collected raw data were carefully cleaned up and then were systematically standardized, which included the disease standardization, EC classification, unit unification, structure availability and crosslink to various reference databases. Detailed description on the way to clean and standardize data was provided in Supplementary Method S2. Furthermore, INTEDE has been smoothly running for months, and tested from different sites around the world. All data could be viewed, accessed, and downloaded (Supplementary Figure S4). Currently, the INTEDE is freely assessed without login requirement by all users at: https://idrblab.org/intede/.  

# INTERACTION CROSSTALK AND PERSPECTIVES  

Although the data of each type of DME interaction in INTEDE were essential for current clinical studies, the crosstalk among different interaction types had emerged to be increasingly important due to the extremely complex mechanisms underlying drug metabolism (10,20,57,86,87). Taking the primary medication for treating Parkinson’s disease––levodopa––as an example, it must enter the brain and be converted there by the human DME aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) to its active form––dopamine. However, the delivery of levodopa to blood–brain barrier is greatly restricted by its intestinal metabolisms of both human and gut microbiome (10). Particularly, the host intestinal AADC and gut microbes Enterococcus faecalis and Eggerthella lenta can convert levodopa into a different chemical before it reaches the brain, which causes unwanted side effects (10). Therefore, levodopa should be co-administrated with other drug by collectively considering multiple DME interactions: (i) the MICBIO between the above microbes and brain DME AADC; (ii) the XEOTIC between xenobiotics carbidopa (inhibitor of intestinal AADC) and AADC (10). In other words, the crosstalk between the MICBIO and XEOTIC of human DME AADC inspired a new strategy that combines AFMT (a microbe inhibitor) and carbidopa (a DME inhibitor)  

![](images/b26fce0532c299c5bf985b841d4c995fcd65553fe255b1cc851663e0f9fbfc9d.jpg)  
Figure 5. A typical INTEDE page offering the data of xenobiotics-DME interaction (XEOTIC). The INTEDE provided 47 778 XEOTICs between 4150 xenobiotics and 501 DMEs, which were diverse. Particularly, the types of xenobiotics included (i) pharmaceutical agents (FDA approved, clinical, preclinical and investigative), (ii) health toxicants (biotoxin, carcinogen, environmental pollutant, mycotoxin and neurotoxin), (iii) natural substances (biological extract, natural product and traditional medicine), (iv) agricultural chemicals (fungicides, herbicides and insecticide), (v) additive agents (food additive and cosmetic additive) and (vi) proteins /peptides.  

with levodopa, for effectively overcoming the serious side effects of anti-Parkinson drug (10).  

Similarly, the HOSPPI between host protein carboxylesterase and DME CYP3A4 was found as the leading cause of drug resistance, which could therefore be reversed by the XEOTIC between xenobiotics vitamin D and DME CYP3A4 (87); the HOSPPI between host protein UGT1A1 and microbial DME beta-glucuronidase was reported to cause diarrhea, which needed be relieved by the XEOTIC between xenobiotic amoxapine and the microbial DME beta-glucuronidase (20,57). Thus, the multiple types of DME interaction in INTEDE might keep inspiring new strategies for dealing with drug resistances and side effects.  

To make the crosstalk analysis of each DME possible, the data of multiple interaction types were systematically collected. As a result, 453 $(43.3\%)$ out of 1047 DMEs were described in INTEDE with multiple interaction types. Moreover, the number of interaction data for each type was from thousands to tens of thousands, which made it highly possible to identify the differential features or generalize the common characteristics from these DME-related big data. Meanwhile, because of the lack of multiple interaction types for the remaining $56.7\%$ DMEs, it is essential to continue drug metabolism studies for a further extension of our knowledge on DME interactome.  

In summary, INTEDE is unique in: (i) providing the largest number of DMEs that are manually curated and systematically confirmed based on their metabolizing drug(s), (ii) covering the novel DME data of diverse microbes (parasitizing in different sites of human body) together with their metabolizing drug(s), (iii) describing the comprehensive interactome data from three perspectives for both human and microbial DMEs and (iv) enabling the crosstalk analysis among various types of DME interaction. With the extensive efforts made on describing DME interactome (3–10) and revealing the crosstalk among interaction types (10,20,57,86,87), those immense, connected and structuralized data provided in INTEDE are expected to have implications for the future practice of clinical treatment optimization (88–92) and personalized medicine (93–96).

# ABSTRACT  

Drug resistance is a major challenge for the treatment of many diseases and a significant concern throughout the drug development process. The ability to understand and predict the effects of mutations on protein–ligand affinities and their roles in the emergence of resistance would significantly aid treatment and drug design strategies. In order to study and understand the impacts of missense mutations on the interaction of ligands with the proteome, we have developed Platinum (http://structure.bioc.cam. ac.uk/platinum). This manually curated, literaturederived database, comprising over 1000 mutations, associates for the first time experimental information on changes in affinity with three-dimensional structures of protein–ligand complexes. To minimize differences arising from experimental techniques and to directly compare binding affinities, Platinum considers only changes measured by the same group and with the same amino-acid sequence used for structure determination, providing a direct link between protein structure, how a ligand binds and how mutations alter the affinity of the ligand of the protein. We believe Platinum will be an invaluable resource for understanding the effects of mutations that give rise to drug resistance, a major problem emerging in pandemics including those caused by the influenza virus, in infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, in cancer and in many other life-threatening illnesses.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Mutations can result in a range of changes to protein function by altering its stability and affinity for binding partners including other proteins and peptides, nucleic acids and small molecules. The strong selective pressure imposed by small molecule drugs on many quickly evolving systems, including viruses, bacteria and human cancer, can lead to the rapid development of resistance (1–4). While rapid and cheaper DNA sequencing has allowed these mutations to be quickly identified in members of large populations (5,6), the significance and characterization of any novel polymorphisms currently requires time-consuming and costly experiments.  

Ligand-binding affinity data for proteins have been an essential source of information for understanding the effects of polymorphisms in disease (7), in addition to identifying those that result in the development of resistance, an increasingly significant problem (8,9). Efforts to link missense mutations to the development of resistance in specific diseases, for example in cancer, tuberculosis and HIV (10–12), have highlighted the importance of these mutations. However, the understanding of the effects of mutations on ligand binding will help expand our knowledge of mechanisms of action, allowing extrapolations to novel mutations and systems. Awareness of these changes is also an essential step toward more effective, personalized and targeted treatment strategies. For example, the resistance profile of emerging influenza strains has been of significant interest to ensure that appropriate antiviral therapeutics can be rapidly administered in the event of an outbreak (13).  

Databases that have linked non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) with structural information and experimentally measured changes in thermodynamic data (14–16) have enabled the development of computational approaches to evaluate missense mutations $(17-$ 19) for their effects on protein stability and binding to protein and nucleic acid partners, expanding our understanding of their roles in disease. Despite its relevance and potential to support studies on emerging phenomena such as drug resistance, no such information is readily available to interrogate the effects of mutations on ligand-binding affinity.  

A compilation of small molecule structural and affinity data for wild-type and mutant proteins would therefore be a valuable resource for developing methods to elucidate mechanisms behind ligand binding and to predict the effects of mutations. In order to fill this gap, we have designed and implemented a freely accessible database, called Platinum, which compiles and associates small molecule affinity data with structural information, experimental methods and conditions, and ligand properties. Furthermore, we have provided a web interface to facilitate searching the database, sorting, visualizing and downloading the results (http://structure.bioc.cam.ac.uk/platinum).  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Data acquisition and curation  

The scientific literature available in PubMed was mined in order to select papers containing structural information of protein–ligand complexes and affinity data for complexes of both wild-type and mutant proteins.  

An initial pool of papers was compiled for manual inspection by selecting those with mutation information associated with deposited protein–ligand complexes in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (20). In order to do so, paper titles and abstracts were filtered using regular expression matching in order to identify candidates for manual curation. The set of terms used on the regular expressions included root words of ‘mutation’, ‘resistance’ and mutation codes in the format $<W T^{-}R e s><R e s-N u m><M T-R e s>$ , where WT-Res is the one-letter code for the wild-type, Res-Num is the residue number and MT-Res is the one-letter code for the mutant residue.  

This procedure identified over 1000 papers, which were manually evaluated against filtering criteria that include requiring affinity data for the construct for which the threedimensional structure had been determined.  

To minimize differences arising from experimental techniques and to be able to compare directly binding affinities (21), we considered only affinity changes measured by the same group, using the same technique and conditions, and with the same amino-acid sequence used to determine the three-dimensional structure, providing a direct link between protein structure, how a ligand binds and how mutations alter the affinity of the ligand for the protein. EC50/IC50 measurements in the absence of the Michaelis constant were not considered due to their inherent dependency on experimental conditions, and incompatibility with binding affinities. Only data from techniques that directly measure the ligand affinity to a protein were entered into Platinum, since indirect methods such as cellular assays have many confounding factors and were therefore discarded.  

Approximately $20\%$ of the identified papers matched our criteria and were manually curated to obtain data that would reflect the effects of mutations on protein–ligand affinity. Over 1000 different affinity data points were manually collated from 182 papers indexed by PubMed. Additional details regarding the experimental techniques and conditions were also entered into Platinum. The PDBcoordinate files for 250 different protein–ligand complexes were downloaded from the RCSB Protein Data Bank, preprocessed and used to supply additional information regarding the protein.  

In order to account for additional consequences of the mutations, the predicted effects of single point mutations on protein stability in the three-dimensional structure were calculated using the integrated approach DUET (17), when a wild-type PDB structure is available. The effects of the mutations on the affinity of a protein–protein interface were predicted by mCSM-PPI (18) when a single-point mutation was within $\mathbf{\check{5}}\mathbf{\AA}$ of a biologically relevant interface, as defined by the author-assigned assemblies.  

Ligand properties such as molecular weight, logP, number of hydrogen acceptors and donors were calculated using RDKit and complementary ligand information such as Canonical Smiles and ligand type were obtained from the PDBeChem (22). All entries were manually doublechecked, with additional filters used to confirm the correctness of all structural and affinity information. Figure 1 shows the workflow for data collection and curation used to build Platinum.  

# Database architecture and web interface  

The collected data were consolidated as a MySQL relational database (version 5.5.35). The information stored in Platinum can be easily queried and downloaded via a userfriendly web interface. Its front-end was implemented using the Bootstrap framework version 2.0, while the backend was built in Python via the Flask framework (version 0.10.1), running on a Linux server.  

# RESULTS: DATABASE FEATURES  

# Web interface  

The web interface to the database displays the home page of Platinum. From here users can access the entire database through a ‘Browse’ function or query the database through a ‘Search’ function (Figure 2). For each data point, displayed by default (Supplementary Figure S1 in Supplementary Material) are the protein name, mutation details, whether the mutation is within $5\mathrm{\AA}$ of the ligand-binding site, the ligand ID (as appears in the PDB), the type of affinity measurement, the affinity for the ligand of the reference and mutant proteins (nM), the PDB codes of the reference and/or mutant protein in complex with the ligand and the PubMed ID of the paper where the affinity data were published.  

Additional information regarding the mutation, protein, ligand and affinity measurements can be toggled on and off depending on requirements of the user. Detailed information of thelocation of the mutation, including secondary structure, hydrogen bonding and solvent accessibility of the reference residue, can be displayed by toggling on residue properties. The extra experimental information includes the method, pH and temperature at which the affinities were measured, as well as the predicted changes in the affinity. The ‘protein toggle’ reveals information about the structure, including the organism, resolution and R-factors. The ‘ligand toggle’ will show several properties calculated using RDKit or obtained from PDBeChem. To facilitate downstream analysis, hyperlinks to the RCSB PDB entries and PubMed abstracts have been included.

Figure 2. Platinums web interface search page. It allows users to query the database by combining different searching criteria such as ligand type, organism from which the protein originates and functional classification as well as mutation properties.  

# Querying the database and downloading the results  

The database can be queried using the web interface (Figure 2). This provides the ability to search the database by ligand and protein type, the kingdom of the organism from which the protein originates, the effect of the mutation on the affinity for the ligand, how the affinity was measured and whether only high-resolution structures, $K_{\mathrm{D}}$ ’s or singlepoint mutations should be displayed.  

The web interface also provides several methods for exporting data. Firstly, the entire platinum database can be downloaded as a comma-delimited file. All the processed and filtered PDB files linked in Platinum can also be downloaded as a separate file. Secondly, the results retrieved by a query can be exported separately as a comma-delimited file.

# Data statistics  

Currently Platinum contains more than 1000 unique data points, with $72\%$ of mutations leading to either a significant increase $(16\%)$ or decrease $(56\%)$ in protein–ligand affinity of over 2-fold (Figure 3A). Most mutations in Platinum $(75\%)$ involve residues directly interacting with the ligand in the three-dimensional structure. Approximately $80\%$ of the data points are from single-point mutations, which are more amenable to computational predictions. The information stored in the database represents a diverse range of proteins, ligands and interactions, as summarized in Table 1. The ligands in the database are quite varied, with molecular weights ranging from 90 to $900\ \mathrm{Da}$ (Figure 3B) and including fragments, inhibitors and therapeutics as well as natural co-factors and substrates (other properties of ligands in Platinum are also depicted in Supplementary Figure S2 of Supplementary Material). The proteins present in the database represent a wide range of biological activities (Figure 3C) highlighting the broad range of effects encompassed within Platinum. While the proteins are from a diverse selection of organisms, the majority $(60\%)$ are from organisms in the Bacterial Domain and Animalia Kingdom (Figure 3D), with approximately $20\%$ of the data from Homo sapiens proteins. This reflects the research emphasis within these areas.  

# DISCUSSION  

The threat of resistance to current therapies is becoming of increasing concern and is widely publicized, especially in regard to the use of antibiotics (23) and emerging pandemics including those caused by the influenza virus (4), in infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (24), in cancer (3) and many other life-threatening illnesses. A repository of mutations and the protein structures within which they occur should be a useful tool to aid the understanding of ligand binding, the development of resistance or the target of a drug or chemical tool. However, no attempt has been made previously to catalog these results, and thus this useful information is currently difficult to access.

Figure 3. Platinum entries statistics. In (A), the histogram of the density distribution of the effect of mutations on protein–ligand affinity within Platinum is shown as the fold change (ratio between affinities of reference and mutant). In (B), the histogram of the density distribution of molecular weights of unique ligands in Platinum is shown. The proteins in Platinum are classified by their function, with the proportion of proteins in the most common classes shown in (C). The proteins are also classified phylogenetically in groups and the proportion of data points per class is shown in (D).  

Previous resources such as PDBbind (25), AffinDB (26) and BindingMOAD (27) provide only the affinity for crystal complexes, while Platinum also maps the effects of mutations on binding affinity. Platinum is also significantly different from BindingDB (28)––only $25\%$ of affinities in Platinum are also present in BindingDB.  

Platinum is the first comprehensive database of its kind that provides experimental information related to changes in protein–ligand affinities upon mutation and their threedimensional structures. Besides providing a collection of affinity and structural data, various analyses and links to web-based databases have been integrated into Platinum to facilitate the detailed examination of these mutations. Platinum will also be useful for developing novel in silico predictive approaches.  

We have observed that predicted changes in protein stability and protein–protein affinity upon mutation show a poor correlation with experimentally measured changes in ligand affinity; therefore a new general method to encompass these effects is required. Some properties appear to correlate better with affinity change, including the distance of the mutated residue to the binding site as well as changes in residue properties. We are currently using structural signatures together with these observations to develop a universal predictive method. The accurate prediction of the changes in ligand affinity upon mutation may not only enhance our understanding of ligand binding and aid in the drug development process but also allow directed administration of therapeutics most likely to be efficacious.

# ABSTRACT  

Deciphering the cell-type composition in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) can significantly increase the efficacy of cancer treatment and improve the prognosis of cancer. Such a task has benefited from microarrays and RNA sequencing technologies, which have been widely adopted in cancer studies, resulting in extensive expression profiles with clinical phenotypes across multiple cancers. Current state-of-the-art tools can infer cell-type composition from bulk expression profiles, providing the possibility of investigating the inter-heterogeneity and intra-heterogeneity of TIME across cancer types. Much can be gained from these tools in conjunction with a well-curated database of TIME cell-type composition data, accompanied by the corresponding clinical information. However, currently available databases fall short in data volume, multi-platform dataset integration, and tool integration. In this work, we introduce TIMEDB (https: //timedb.deepomics.org), an online database for human tumor immune microenvironment cell-type composition estimated from bulk expression profiles. TIMEDB stores manually curated expression profiles, cell-type composition profiles, and the corresponding clinical information of a total of 39,706 samples from 546 datasets across 43 cancer types. TIMEDB comes readily equipped with online tools for automatic analysis and interactive visualization, and aims to serve the community as a convenient tool for investigating the human tumor microenvironment.

# INTRODUCTION  

In cancer, the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is characterized by dynamic interactions between tumor and immune cells (1,2). Deciphering the cell-type composition in the TIME can significantly improve cancer prognosis and increase the efficacy of cancer treatment (3). TIME cell-type composition could illuminate details on how tumor cells escape the immune response. In clinical trials, TIME celltype composition can stratify patients and assign the most appropriate treatment regimen according to the target cell types, thus enhancing the treatment options and ultimately improving overall survival (4).  

Wet-lab approaches like fluorescence-activated cell sorting and immunohistochemical staining have been adopted as the gold standards for assessing the number of immune cells in tumor samples. However, flow cytometry demands plenty of cells, which limits its use in tumor biopsies. Immunohistochemical staining estimates individual tumor dissection slides, which cannot represent the heterogeneous immune panorama of the tumor. Additionally, both methods merely infer a small number of cell types. Recent breakthroughs in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) have been used to catalog cell type and status. However, it is still costly and tedious for routine clinical applications (5–7).  

Microarray and bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) have been widely adopted in cancer studies, accumulating extensive bulk expression profiles with clinical phenotypes in multiple cancers (6). Present state-of-the-art tools estimate the cell-type composition from bulk expression profiles, allowing the investigation of inter-heterogeneity and intraheterogeneity of TIME across cancers. However, there are very steep learning curves in running these tools for nonbioinformaticians and in curating the corresponding clinical data for non-clinicians. The task can be made more accessible with a well-curated database that brings together TIME cell-type composition data, the corresponding clinical information, and the tools for effective TIME exploration.  

Existing online databases that estimated TIME cell-type composition from bulk expression profiles include CancerImmunityQTL (7), GEPIA2021 (8), TCIA (9), TISMO (10), and TIMER2.0 (11). However, these databases have several limitations. (i) Most of the TIME cell-type composition profiles are estimated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) repositories (12); the TIME cell-type composition profiles from the extensive pool of bulk expression outside TCGA are ineffectively exploited. (ii) The TIME cell-type composition profiles from the state-of-the-art tools are unavailable in the current databases, and the computational biases from different approaches are incompletely presented. (iii) Integration analyses of TIME cell-type composition among multiple datasets are required to infer the landscape of tumor-specific TIME signatures (1,2). However, such integration analyses from multiple datasets are either missing from these databases or only provided rudimentarily. (iv) These databases offer little in the way of interactive visualizations that are helpful to scientific explorations (13,14).  

To overcome these limitations, we propose TIMEDB (https://timedb.deepomics.org), an online human tumor immune microenvironment cell-type composition database with automatic analysis and interactive visualization. TIMEDB has three key features: (i) A curated TIME database of more than 39,706 samples and 546 datasets across 43 cancers, including bulk expression data, clinical data, TIME cell-type composition data estimated by ten state-of-the-art tools, C1-C6 immune subtyping data, etc. (ii) Automatic interfaces of 21 tumor immune microenvironment analyses, including TIME cell-type composition estimation, survival, etc. (iii) Interactive visualizations of gene expression, TIME cell-type composition estimation, patient subtyping, survival, and correlation result from the database or analysis.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Data collection  

We first summarized and collected gene expression data for 32 cancer types from Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (12) and six cancer types from Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) (Supplementary Table S1) (15) . TCGA clinical data and raw RNA-Seq (HTSeq) counts were downloaded through TCGAbiolinks (16). Collapsed files from the publicly available TARGET clinical and level 3 gene expression matrix were downloaded from https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target/ data-matrix (15). Then, we conducted a systematic search in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, https://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/geoprofiles/) (17) and the Array Express portal (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/) (18) with the names of 38 cancer types and ‘Expression Profile’ as keywords during June 2021–June 2022. As a result, we collected a total of 39,706 samples from 546 publicly available datasets with curated clinical information and gene expression profiles. The brief descriptions and references of the 546 datasets are listed in Supplementary Table S2.  

# Clinical data curation  

We manually assigned each sample to 38 cancer types according to their primary lesions and metastatic statuses. Tumors other than the 38 types were assigned to SCLC (Small Cell Lung Cancer), CLL (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia), RT (Rhabdoid Tumor), CML (Chronic Myelogenic Leukemia), and Other, resulting a total of 43 cancer types except ‘Other’ (Supplementary Table S1). We curated two primary endpoints for each dataset: overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). OS refers to the date of diagnosis to death or the last follow-up, and PFS indicates the date of recurrence/relapse/progression or last follow-up. Tumor subtype, stage, grade, type, metastasis, treatment response, etc., are curated if available. All manually curated profiles are checked by at least three individuals. The curation details can be viewed at the ‘Curated Clinical Headers’ on each dataset information page. Here, we also included any available normal or blood samples labeled with ‘tumor subtype: normal’ in each dataset.  

# Bulk expression profiles preprocessing  

We first transferred the array probe id (microarray) or the gene ensemble id (RNA-Seq) to the HUGO gene symbol for each data set. Duplicated gene entries are aggregated with their mean expression data. The normalization and transformation of the expression data conform to the guiding principles of Quackenbush (19), Ali et al. (1), and Gao et al. (2). We applied quantile normalization, $\log_{2}$ , and scale to microarray intensity datasets. We converted the raw count of RNA-Seq into logarithmic transcripts per kilobase million ( $\log_{2}$ TPM) values. The preprocessing steps for each dataset are recorded in the ‘Dataset’ table with the ‘TIMEDB RNA process’ field.  

# Batch effect elimination  

In an analysis involving multiple datasets, we employed sva (20) to eliminate batch effects of expression profiles from different datasets or platforms. We applied Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) (21) into the expression profiles to check the efficacy of the batch effect elimination. In the UMAP plot (Supplementary Figure S1A), each point represents a sample. Before batch effect removal, samples in different datasets and platforms stay apart in the UMAP plot. After batch-effect removal, samples with the same molecular characteristics from different datasets or platforms tend to be mixed (Supplementary Figure S1B).  

# TIME cell-type composition quality control, estimation, and other data processing  

The details of the TIME cell-type composition quality control, estimation, and further data processing are recorded in Supplementary Methods.  

# Platform development  

TIMEDB is hosted on a CentOS 7.4 server with 128GB memory and 60TB storage. The backend is supported by in-house framework (22), consisting of Ruby (v2.7.1), Ruby on Rails (v6.0.2), Apache (v2.4.6), and PostgreSQL (v12.3). The frontend support includes HTML5, Bootstrap4, ES6, Node.js, Vue.js (v2.6.10), and Oviz (13) (https:// oviz.org). We have tested TIMEDB on the following operating systems and browsers. Linux: Firefox, Chrome; macOS: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge; Windows: Firefox, Edge, and Chrome.  

# RESULTS  

# TIMEDB database  

TIMEDB holds curated gene expression profiles and the corresponding clinical information (basic characteristics, survival, etc.) from a total of 39,706 samples across 546 datasets across 43 cancer types (Figure 1, Supplementary Table S1, and Supplementary Figures S2–S3). Sequencing protocols include microarray and RNA-Seq. The data sources consist of TCGA, TARGET, GEO (17), and ArrayExpress (18).  

TIMEDB stores the TIME cell-type composition profiles estimated by ten state-of-the-art methods. TIME celltype composition estimation methods are classified into regression-based deconvolution approaches and gene set enrichment-based approaches. ABIS performs deconvolution of the absolute cell proportion of 29 immune cell types on RNA-Seq and microarray data (23). CIBERSORT infers the fraction of 22 TIME cell types from gene expression data (24). This method relies on cell-specific gene signatures and Nu-support vector regression. CIBERSORTx, which extends on CIBERSORT, incorporates ComBat to address possible cross-platform batch effects in gene experssion data (25). EPIC quantitatively analyzes the ratio of immune and non-tumor cells in TIME from expression profiles by applying constrained least squares regression (26). The quanTIseq method quantifies the proportion of ten different immune cell types and the proportion of other noncharacteristic cells from bulk gene expression of heterogeneous samples. It solves cell-type composition devolution problems by constrained least squares regression (27). TIMER selects marker genes negatively correlated with tumor purity for 32 cancer types from TCGA. It adopts constrained least squares to infer the fraction of six immune cell types (28). TIMEDB database stores the predicted cell-type composition profiles of ABIS, CIBERSORT, CIBERSORTx, EPIC, quanTIseq, and TIMER of the datasets 513, 513, 507, 37, 512, and 455, respectively.  

In addition, there are four enrichment-based tools. ConsensusTME (29) is an ssGSEA-based approach. It first integrates gene sets from Bindea et al. (30), Davoli et al. (31), Danaher et al. (32), CIBERSORT LM22 (24), MCPcounter (33), TIMER (28), and xCell (34). Then, consensus marker genes for 18 cell types and 32 TCGA cancer types are curated. This package allows users to choose a type of TCGA cancer and uses ssGSEA to generate normalized enrichment scores and infer the relative TIME cell-type fractions. ImmuCellAI is an online cell abundance identifier based on ssGSEA, explicitly focusing on determining the abundance of $18\mathrm{T}$ cell subtypes (35). MCPcounter quantifies the absolute abundance of eight immune cell types and two stromal cell types from gene expression data via ssGSEA (33). xCell is a cell quantitative analysis tool based on ssGSEA; it calculates the enrichment fraction of 64 types of immune and nonimmune cells (34). In the TIMEDB database, we obtained ConsensusTME-, ImmuCellAI-, MCPcounter-, and xCell-inferred cell abundance for the 452, 475, 483, and 461 datasets, respectively.  

Furthermore, TIMEDB provides the consensus and integrated TIME cell-type composition estimation by ten stateof-the-art tools for each dataset. The consensus result removes cell types that occur only once among ten tools. The integration result means that the cell-type composition is inferred from all tools, and the composition profiles of all cell types are combined into one file.  

TIMEDB also keeps immune subtypes predicted by ImmuneSubtypeClassifier (36,37), which forms a part of the ‘Immune Landscape of Cancer’ (38). The tool accepts RNA sequencing data as input and calculates the probabilities for a patient concerning six immune statuses, including C1 (wound healing), C2 (IFN- $\cdot\gamma$ dominant), C3 (inflammatory), C4 (lymphocyte depleted), C5 (immunologically quiet), and C6 (TGF- $\cdot\upbeta$ dominant). Currently, TIMEDB contains the ImmuneSubtypeClassifier-inferred C1–C6 subtyping results for 511 curated datasets.  

The ‘Immune Landscape of Cancer’ (38) also asserts seventy-nine immunomodulators. These immunomodulating proteins can be categorized into TNF, MHC Class II, Immunoglobulin, or CXC chemokine gene family; they can also be classified into ligand, receptor, or antigen presentation. From an immune checkpoint view, they can be inhibitory or stimulatory. In the TIMEDB database, we provide 520 immunomodulatory gene expression profiles from curated datasets.

# TIMEDB analysis  

TIMEDB offers an automatic TIME analysis workflow for researchers to run their newly sequenced bulk expression profiles (Figure 2). This workflow includes all the tools mentioned earlier for TIME cell-type composition estimation, TIME cell-type composition-guided patient subtyping, survival analysis, correlation analysis, differential expression analysis, etc. Users can upload their gene expression data or select TIMEDB datasets for independent or integrated analyzes with simple mouse operations.  

Regarding TIME estimation, with the exception of CIBERSORTx and ImmunecellAI, which only provide online interfaces, all remaining composition estimation tools are included in the TIMEDB analysis interfaces. We have five deconvolution-based interfaces: ‘TIMEDB Deconv ABIS’, ‘TIMEDB Deconv CIBERSORT’, ‘TIMEDB Deconv EPIC’, ‘TIMEDB Deconv quanTIseq’, and ‘TIMEDB Deconv TIMER’. Similarly, we have three enrichment-based analysis interfaces: ‘TIMEDB Deconv ConsensusTME’, ‘TIMEDB Deconv MCPcounter’, and ‘TIMEDB Deconv xCell’. TIMEDB also includes the LinSeed software into the analysis interface ‘TIMEDB Deconv LinSeed’. Unlike supervised prediction, Linseed utilizes nonnegative matrix factorization to reveal the TIME cell-type composition without prior knowledge of the cell types and their abundances (39). It predicts the fraction of $k$ TIME cell subtypes and the gene signatures of the corresponding cell subtypes. Users need to manually annotate resolved cell subtypes.RNA-Seq  

Furthermore, TIMEDB implements ‘TIME Consensus RNA-Seq’, ‘TIME Consensus Array’, ‘TIMEDB ALL RNA-Seq’, and ‘TIMEDB ALL Array’ to provide comparison analysis among different datasets and estimation tools. ‘Consensus’ mode keeps cell types occurring more than twice among different tools, and the ‘All’ mode combines absolute results for all TIME cell types.  

TIMEDB also supports several downstream immune analyses. Molecular subtyping of tumors is an approach to categorizing cancer patients into different subgroups based on molecular profiles and unsupervised clustering tools. ImmuneSubtypeClassifier is included in TIMEDB as the analysis interface ‘TIMEDB C1–C6 Subtyping’ for researchers to predict the six immune statuses, C1–C6 as explained in database section. Moreover, we provide the TIME cell-type composition-guided patient subtyping. Unsupervised clustering approaches, including $k$ -means, hierarchical clustering, and nonnegative matrix factorization, are available in the analysis interface ‘TIMEDB Cell Fraction Subtyping’. Furthermore, we group the patients into quantiles based on the TIME cell-type composition and consider the quantiles as the patient subtype. For example, patients can be classified into Q1 B cell $(0-25\%)$ , Q2 B cell $(25-50\%)$ , $\mathbf{Q}3\mathbf{\beta}\mathbf{B}$ cell $(50-75\%)$ , and Q4 B cell $(75-100\%)$ according to the quantiles of the fraction of B cell types.  

Survival analysis is essential to draw the clinical implication from TIME cell-type composition. The Kaplan–Meier (KM) study shows the probability of OS or PFS for a patient subgroup at a specific time, illustrating the difference in prognostic events between different subtypes of patients. The hazard ratio (HR) and the odds ratio (OR) of prognostic associations between the subtypes of patients and survival outcomes customized (OS or PFS) are also vital prognostic indications. Here, the ‘TIMEDB KM Estimator’ and ‘TIMEDB HR OR’ allow researchers to run their newly sequenced data and custom clinical subgroup labels.

Figure 3. The overview of TIMEDB visualization design.  

Cell-type interaction and correlation are essential in TIME. We provide ‘TIMEDB Correlation’ and ‘TIMEDB Interaction’ for researchers to calculate the Pearson correlation and associated significance test.  

Understanding the expressions of immunomodulatory genes in different stages of TIME is critical for immunotherapy (38). TIMEDB provides an analysis interface ‘TIMEDB Immunoregulator’ that shows the differential expression of immunomodulatory genes among different patient subtypes, including tumor grades, tumor stages, tumor types, etc., wherever available.  

# Interactive visualization  

TIMEDB supports interactive visualizations of TIME cell-type composition estimation (Supplementary Figures S4 and S5), patient subtyping (Supplementary Figures S6 and S7), survival (Supplementary Figures S8–S10), cell-type correlation, interaction (Supplementary Figures S11 and S12), and immunoregulator data (Supplementary Figure S13) from databases or analyses (Figure 3). Multiple interaction options are available, including informative tooltips, changeable plot size, edited labels, and color picker, etc. All visualizations are downloadable in high-quality publication-ready format.

For instance, CancerImmunityQTL offered downloadable datasets, but no dataset could be downloaded when the button was clicked. In addition, CancerImmunityQTL provides some visualizations about the cell-type composition and KM survival estimation, but the current version does not successfully display these visualizations. ‘o’ means only a few are included.

# DISCUSSION  

Understanding the cell-type composition in the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) can significantly improve the cancer prognosis and increase cancer treatment efficacy. Here, we present TIMEDB, an online human tumor immune microenvironment cell-type composition database with automatic analysis and interactive visualization. TIMEDB has the following merits compared to existing online TIME cell-type composition databases and webservers (Table 1):  

First, TIMEDB manually curated bulk expression and clinical profiles of 39,678 samples and 545 datasets across 43 types of cancer from TCGA, TARGET, GEO, and Array Express. Other databases such as CancerImmunityQTL, GEPIA2021, TCIA and TIMER2.0 only contain 33, 33, 33 and 32 TCGA datasets, respectively. TIMEDB provides the opportunity to effectively explore the heterogeneity of TIME from the extensive pool of bulk expression profiles outside TCGA.  

Second, we conducted TIME cell estimation using ten state-of-the-art tools, including ABIS, CIBERSORT, CIBERSORTx, EPIC, quanTIseq, TIMER, ConsensusTME, ImmuneCellAI, MCPcounter, and xCell. Such comprehensive TIME cell-type composition profiles from state-of-the-art tools are unavailable in existing databases. For instance, CancerImmunityQTL, GEPIA2021, TCIA, and TIMER2.0 only adopted one (CIBERSORT), one (CIBERSORT), and three (CIBERSORT, EPIC, quanTIseq), and six (CIBERSORT, EPIC, quanTIseq, TIMER, MCPcounter, xCell) estimation tools, respectively. This comprehensiveness can help avoid possible computational biases in the individual tool. Third, TIMEDB infers the landscape of tumor-specific TIME signatures through integration analysis of TIME cell-type composition among multiple datasets, including the above TIME cell-type composition estimation tools, TIME cell-type composition guided patient subtyping, survival analysis, correlation analysis, differential expression analysis, etc. In contrast, CancerImmunityQTL and TCIA databases do not support online analysis. GEPIA2021, TISMO, and TIMER2.0 embed a few TIME cell-type composition tools and do not have inconvenient integration analyses for multiple datasets.  

Fourth, TIMEDB provides informative visualizations to boost productive scientific explorations, including gene expression, TIME cell-type composition, patient subtyping, survival, and correlation data from databases or analyses. Multiple interaction options are available, including informative tooltips, changeable plot size, edited labels, optional color picker, etc. All visualizations are available for download in a high-quality publication-ready format. In contrast, CancerImmunityQTL, TISMO, and TIMER2.0 only provide static low-resolution pictures.  

One thing to note here is that TIMEDB focuses on the cell-type composition profiles estimated from the bulk expression. Recent breakthroughs in scRNA-Seq have been used to classify cell types and states in TIME with singlecell resolution. Currently, we are collecting and collating cell-type composition profiles from scRNA-Seq for the upgraded version of TIMEDB.  

With comprehensive TIME cell-type composition profiles, analyses, and visualizations at the pan-cancer level, we envision TIMEDB to become a convenient tool for scientists to investigate the biological understanding of human tumor microenvironment study.

# ABSTRACT  

CRISPRz (http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/CRISPRz/) is a database of CRISPR/Cas9 target sequences that have been experimentally validated in zebrafish. Programmable RNA-guided CRISPR/Cas9 has recently emerged as a simple and efficient genome editing method in various cell types and organisms, including zebrafish. Because the technique is so easy and efficient in zebrafish, the most valuable asset is no longer a mutated fish (which has distribution challenges), but rather a CRISPR/Cas9 target sequence to the gene confirmed to have high mutagenic efficiency. With a highly active CRISPR target, a mutant fish can be quickly replicated in any genetic background anywhere in the world. However, sgRNA’s vary widely in their activity and models for predicting target activity are imperfect. Thus, it is very useful to collect in one place validated CRISPR target sequences with their relative mutagenic activities. A researcher could then select a target of interest in the database with an expected activity. Here, we report the development of CRISPRz, a database of validated zebrafish CRISPR target sites collected from published sources, as well as from our own in-house large-scale mutagenesis project. CRISPRz can be searched using multiple inputs such as ZFIN IDs, accession number, UniGene ID, or gene symbols from zebrafish, human and mouse.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein (Cas9) is an acquired immunity system found in archea and bacteria that protects against invading viruses, baceteriophages and other exogenous DNA (1–3). The Cas9 is a programmable, RNA-guided endonuclease that functions together with CRISPR RNA crRNA and transactivating crRNA (tracrRNA) to create a DNA target site for cleavage (4). The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been exploited by researchers as an in vivo genome-editing tool in a wide variety of cell types and organisms, including zebrafish (5–9).  

The bipartite RNA-guided component was further simplified into a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) (4,6) the sequence of which directs Cas9 to a target site and causes a double-stranded break. That cleavage site is then either repaired using error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology directed repair (HDR) when a donor DNA is present. CRISPR/Cas9 has been used in a variety of applications such as generating gene knockouts via indels, making precise sequence alteration in the genome with knock-in strategies, chromosomal rearrangements, transcriptional activation, transcriptional repression, conditional mutagenesis, genome-wide screens, genomic locus imaging, and human therapeutics (10,11). In zebrafish, CRISPR/Cas9 has been shown to work for both generating gene knockouts (8,12) and integrating exogenous DNA into a specific locus (i.e. knock-ins) (13–15). Efficient guide RNAs have been shown to generate bi-allelic mutations in zebrafish, and phenotypes can often be observed in injected embryos (8), making it possible to perform large-scale phenotypic screening in injected embryos (16). The modular nature of CRISPR/Cas9 also allows targeting multiple genes simultaneously. With approximately $20\%$ of the zebrafish genome duplicated, making double or triple mutants simultaneously is an important application of CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis for zebrafish. Recently, we showed that CRISPR/Cas9 is six-times more efficient than two other genome-editing techniques, ZFNs and TALENs, in generating germline mutations (12). Two other large-scale studies measured somatic activities for more than 1000 genomic targets in zebrafish (17,18) and many other studies are using CRISPR/Cas9 in various applications (13,14,16,19–26). Given the increasing popularity of zebrafish as a model organism (27) and the rapid adoption of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in zebrafish, an integrated resource for all CRISPR target sites that have been validated is useful to the community. Here, we report the development of CRISPRz, the first database of experimentally validated CRISPR/Cas9 target sequences from our ongoing large-scale genome-editing project as well as other published sources.

Figure 1. Overview of data collection methods. (A) Two sgRNA and Cas9 was injected into 1-cell stage embryos and the somatic and germline mutagenesis activities were measured according to Carrington et al. (30) and Varshney et al. (12). (B) CRISPR target sequences were extracted from the published sources and related information was obtained from the UCSC genome browser.  

embryos were raised to adults. To determine germline mutagenesis activity, the ‘founder’ fish were either outcrossed or inbred to generate $\mathrm{F}_{1}$ embryos and the mutagenesis activity was determined using fluorescent PCR (29). The somatic activity was measured using the CRISPR-STAT assay (30) from 2-day post-fertilization embryos. We also obtained data from published sources: the target sequences, their mutagenesis activity and genotyping primers, the genomic co-ordinates and protoacceptor-motif (PAM).  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Data sources  

CRISPRz contains data from published sources as well as our ongoing genome-editing project (Figure 1). Currently, CRISPRz has 479 validated targets from 10 sources (5,7,8,12,14–16,18,25,28). There are 146 targets that have not been previously published and 333 targets that have been extracted from published sources. The somatic and germline activities were measured using different methods depending on the source. Each target is assigned an activity based on the techniques used for each published CRISPR target (12). We used the $\%$ mutagenesis rate based on germline transmission for each target. For our in-house mutagenesis project, the CRISPR targets were designed using a Browser Extensible Data (BED) track that contains 18 367 469 CRISPR targets in the zebrafish genome (13). For each gene, two targets were chosen and the sgRNA was prepared in vitro from a synthesized template. The two sgRNAs and Cas9 was injected into one-cell stage embryos and the  

# Database structure and implementation  

The CRISPRz database is hosted on an Apache web server (2.2.15) running Scientific Linux release 6.6 (Carbon) and utilizes the Common Gateway Interface (CGI), developed using perl programming, that connects with an Oracle $11\mathrm{g}$ relational database. The Web site uses Perl, HTML, Java Script and Template toolkit, and the search function was developed in Perl and CGI. The connectivity between the CGI and the database was implemented using Perl’s database Interface (DBI) module, and the Oracle database driver for the DBI module (DBD::oracle). The database is composed of tables that store data content, including the zebrafish gene names and gene symbols, as well as the human and mouse orthologs. The gene annotation data and orthologs were downloaded from the Zebrafish Information Network (http://zfin.org). A set of Perl scripts was developed to add new data and annotation into CRISPRz.

Figure 2. CRISPRz search interface and search output. (A) The CRISPRz database can be queried with accession numbers from a number of sources, including Ensembl, GenBank, RefSeq and ZFIN. Users can also query by human, mouse, or zebrafish gene symbols and gene names, either single entry or multiple entries. CRISPRz can also be searched using a source lab name or using the last name of the first author of a publication. All searches allow for an exact match (is) or a query with wildcards (contains) (B) The zebrafish gene symbol ‘ptp’ was entered in the Search by Single Gene box. Since the ‘contains’ radio button was selected, all zebrafish gene symbols in ZFIN containing the text string $\cdot_{p t p},$ are returned. Each gene name is linked to ZFIN entries for specific genes.  

# RESULTS  

# Database navigation  

The CRISPRz Web interface has a navigation sidebar that provides links to various sections of the database. Users can search CRISPRz by clicking on the Search link on the left sidebar. We provide a user-friendly search interface that accepts multiple inputs and allows users to search using different identifiers. There are four different ways to search CRISPRz - search by ID, search by single gene, search by gene list and search by the source lab or publication. The search by ID accepts different identifiers such as Ensembl (e.g. ENSDARG00000039077), GenBank (e.g. BC133731), RefSeq (e.g. NM 13108), UniGene (e.g. Dr.75081) or ZFIN (e.g. ZDB-GENE-990415-171). The user can use either a single ID or a list of IDs separated by commas, spaces or carriage returns. The search by single gene accepts gene symbols (e.g. tyr) or gene name (e.g. tyrosinase) from zebrafish, mouse, or human. CRISPRz also has a bulk search option that allows users to use a list of gene names or gene symbols separated by commas, spaces or carriage returns. Since CRISPRz contains data from various labs, users can search by the source lab (e.g. Shawn Burgess or Chen). CRISPRz can also be searched using the first author’s last name for the publication (e.g. Jao).  

# CRISPRz search output  

An example of the result of a search is shown in Figure 2. For each query term, the CRISPRz ID, zebrafish gene name, chromosome number, target sequence, PAM site, Cas9 used (e.g. Streptococcus pyogens $(S.p.))$ , the somatic or germline activity $\%$ mutagenesis rate or active/inactive)  

with the identification method (e.g. sequencing or fluorescent PCR or surveyor assay or T7 endonuclease assay), genotyping primers, source lab and the reference if available are shown. Each gene is linked to the ZFIN gene page and the target sequence is linked to the UCSC genome browser track allowing users to locate the position of the target in the genome. The reference link is connected to PubMed.  

# CRISPR target tracks  

We previously pre-computed all possible CRISPR targets in the zebrafish genome and generated a Browser Extensible Data (BED) track that contains 18 367 469 CRISPR target sites (12). This data hub is hosted on the UCSC genome browser and is available for upload in Ensembl. CRISPRz hosts a link to the data hub on the UCSC genome browser. Users can select a CRISPR target from the UCSC genome browser by searching for their gene name or the gene’s genomic coordinates.  

# Methods and protocols  

CRISPRz hosts protocols for making sgRNA, microinjection, genotyping (12), somatic activity measurement by fluorescent PCR (CRISPR-STAT) (30) and a calculator for determining the amount of sgRNA and Cas9 used for microinjection (CRISPR-CALC).  

# Data submission  

We have generated a template in Excel that will allow users to submit their data to CRISPRz by email. All usersubmitted data will be reviewed and verified manually for a consistent format and then moved to the database. In the future, we will provide an online submission for entering data.  

# Accessibility  

CRISPRz can be accessed at http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/ crisprz. The CRISPRz data can also be downloaded in CSV format.  

# CONCLUSIONS  

CRISPRz was developed in an effort to provide a comprehensive list of validated CRISPR targets from published sources as well as from an ongoing genome-wide knockout project in the zebrafish genome. Data will be added as more validated CRISPR targets are published or contributed from unpublished, in-house projects. The database is also open for data submission from the research community. An effort is being made to cross-reference CRISPRz with the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN) database. CRISPRz will host the most up-to-date protocols and methods from the Burgess lab. We believe by providing a list of validated CRIPSR targets, the community will save significant time and resources.

# ABSTRACT  

The Addgene Repository (http://www.addgene.org) was founded to accelerate research and discovery by improving access to useful, high-quality research materials and information. The repository archives plasmids generated by scientists, conducts quality control, annotates the associated data and makes the plasmids and their data available to the scientific community. Plasmid associated data undergoes ongoing curation by members of the scientific community and by Addgene scientists. The growing database contains information on ${>}31$ 000 unique plasmids spanning most experimental biological systems and organisms. The library includes a large number of plasmid tools for use in a wide variety of research areas, such as empty backbones, lentiviral resources, fluorescent protein vectors and genome engineering tools. The Addgene Repository database is always evolving with new plasmid deposits so it contains currently pertinent resources while ensuring the information on earlier deposits is still available. Custom search and browse features are available to access information on the diverse collection. Extensive educational materials and information are provided by the database curators to support the scientists that are accessing the repository’s materials and data.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Plasmids are circular fragments of double-stranded DNA that can replicate independently of chromosomal DNA. In 1952, Joshua Lederberg was the first scientist to give this name to small, extra-chromosomal, heritable determinants (1). By the 1970s and the advent of molecular biology tools, such as restriction enzymes and DNA ligases, scientists were able to use plasmids to study individual genes. Today scientists study genes and other genetic elements using a multitude of specifically engineered plasmids. Plasmids have become a ubiquitous research tool fulfilling a large number of functions for many reasons. First, steady advances in cloning methods have made it increasingly easy to generate useful and diverse plasmid constructs. Second, plasmid DNA is stable and, once introduced to bacteria, can be stored and indefinitely replicated. Finally, plasmids are useful for studies on virtually any biological pathway or system in a wide variety of organisms. For all these same reasons, plasmids are excellent research materials for archiving and sharing.  

As grant funding becomes harder to access, scientists are finding it increasingly important to be efficient with resources (2,3). Time and money are wasted in regenerating similar plasmid constructs in different laboratories. It makes sense for useful plasmids to be shared widely to accelerate research. In the past, plasmids were generated by graduate students and postdoctoral candidates then used for a few or even one publication before being relegated to the freezer when the trainee moved on to their next position. Valuable materials were languishing unused and potential collaborations were never initiated. The Addgene Repository and other plasmid repositories prevent this waste by helping scientists to archive and share plasmids (4–6). The Addgene Repository and database are focused on encouraging materials sharing and collaboration in addition to careful archiving of samples (7). Search functions are improved to make sure that the information on all materials can be discovered by researchers. New deposits are always being added to the database to ensure that the materials remain relevant for current research. That being said, some of the most popular plasmids have been in the database for over 10 years (8).  

Repositories also play a role in standardization of reagents as an important part of improving data reproducibility (9–11). Most journals and funding agencies suggest or require that scientists make research materials available to other scientists after publication. It is not easy for every lab to comply with this best practice. Materials sharing, especially for international collaboration, can be hampered by logistical constraints. Repositories provide tested, standardized reagents and associated data to help scientists confirm and extend published results.  

# OVERVIEW OF THE PLASMID DATABASE  

# Growth and curation of the database  

More that 31,000 unique plasmids are available for request from the Addgene database. Deposits come to the repository by a few mechanisms. The Addgene Scientist Team scans the literature and solicits the deposit of published plasmids. Addgene Outreach Scientists visit laboratories around the world to meet as many scientists as possible in person. Finally, as more laboratories join the Addgene Repository community and are familiar with the advantages of using a data and materials repository, an increasing number of contributions are initiated by depositing scientists themselves.  

The Addgene Repository archives plasmids and plasmid collections that may be published, unpublished or published only in part (some example plasmid collections are listed in Table 1; see for example, the Davidson FP collection). In the process of generating data for publications or grant applications, current cloning methods often result in useful intermediate constructs or plasmids that would not be used in a publication but are useful to others and merit database inclusion.  

Relevant plasmid information, such as cloning sites, mutations, resistance markers and available sequence information, is stored in the database. If applicable, plasmids are linked to the article in which they were first described, which provides relevant information for requesting scientists and ensures that depositing labs are cited appropriately. Supporting data and documents can also be provided for each plasmid. For example, a plasmid encoding a fluorescent protein might have associated data files with example images of cellular localization. These associated data are a valuable component of the database for scientists planning experiments.  

After data entry, every plasmid undergoes sequence analysis of key regions (ends, tags, mutations, etc.) for construct validation and quality control. Any discrepancies from the depositor-provided sequences are resolved before the plasmid cloning data and sequences are posted to the database. Samples are stored in triplicate (including storage of the full library at an offsite back-up facility). The technology transfer process largely goes on behind the scenes so that depositing and requesting scientists can receive the benefits of having the correct agreements in place without having to spend a significant amount of time for each exchange.  

Scientists are able to initiate a deposit before a planned paper is submitted. All of the information provided for the deposit can be embargoed, that is, not made publicly visible until publication. Pre-publication deposit is a valuable benefit to scientists. As soon as the deposit is initiated each plasmid is assigned a unique Addgene Accession number which can be included in the materials and methods section of a publication. Similar to a reagent catalog number, inclusion of an Addgene Accession number in the publication helps readers to quickly find plasmid cloning details. On the Pubmed database of indexed citations and abstracts (http: //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), the abstract listings for publications containing Addgene Repository plasmid references include a direct link to the webpage displaying the plasmids deposited for that paper. Easy access to this page and detailed plasmid information adds value to online publications.

Species Representation of Gene Inserts (%)   
Figure 1. Species Representation of Gene Inserts. As of July 2014 the proportion of plasmids in the Addgene library with inserts from each of the indicated species. Insert species data were provided by depositors or available for 22,825 plasmids in the library. For some plasmids (e.g. research tools, synthetic genes) there is no appropriate inserts species.  

# The plasmid library  

Plasmids in the database are useful for studies in a wide variety of different experimental systems and model organisms. This diversity reflects the research fields of the ${>}2000$ depositing laboratories from ${>}500$ institutions around the world. Almost half of the library’s plasmids have been designated as containing human gene sequence inserts (Figure 1). Most fields of research are represented in the library. Some areas for which the repository has especially rich resources include: neuroscience, stem cell research, lentiviral transduction, fluorescent protein tagging, optogenetics and genome engineering. A review of the 25 most accessed plasmids over time reflects popular plasmid technologies that are all well represented in the library (12). This top 25 list includes plasmids for retroviral expression, lentiviral expression, luciferase reporter assays, RNA interference studies, generation of induced pluripotent stem cells, mammalian Cre-Lox control and TALEN and CRISPR plasmids for genome engineering.  

The library is curated into convenient collections to allow requesting scientists to more easily browse plasmids for experimental design and planning (Table 1). For example, one of the most popular collections pages is the Plasmid Backbone Guide (addgene.org/emptybackbones), which helps requestors choose among the library’s 2,500 empty backbones (Figure 2). Examples of other highly accessed pages include the Fluorescent Protein Guide (addgene.org/fluorescent-proteins), Lentiviral Plasmid Collection (addgene.org/lentiviral), Popular Plasmids (addgene.org/popular-plasmids) and Genome Engineering Guide (addgene.org/genome engineering).

Figure 2. Empty Backbone Plasmids at Addgene. The number of backbone plasmid vectors in the Addgene library designated by depositor recommended expression. As of July 2014 the total number of plasmids designated as ‘Empty Backbone’ is 2,596.  

Research consortia also work with the repository to generate customized consortium home pages to make their plasmid collections as accessible as possible to scientists in their fields. See, for example, the Biobrick Public Agreement Collection (addgene.org/biobrick public agreement collection), the Parkinson’s Disease Plasmid Resource (addgene.org/PD) and the Structural Genomics Consortium Collection (addgene.org/sgc). The consortium pages offer collaborative research programs a way to highlight their resources and to encourage deposit to the database.  

# ACCESSING THE ADDGENE DATABASE  

# Search features  

Addgene Database queries start with the search box in the top right corner of every page at addgene.org. Scientists can search by gene name, gene alias, depositing scientist, publication author, Addgene Accession Number or any other relevant search term. The search results page displays two separate search boxes. The ‘Full Site Search’ box searches all of the site’s web content. This search can be used, for example, to find information about ordering, educational resources or to search for a publication author that is not the Principal Investigator (PI). The ‘Search for Plasmids’ box is optimized to search and retrieve plasmid-specific results. The plasmid search can be refined by toggling ‘Show/hide additional search fields’ and entering criteria in multiple fields.  

If a gene name/alias is used in the ‘Search for Plasmids’ box, the first results will be associated resource pages if there are matches to the search term. These will be followed by the summary list of matching plasmid records. The summary list entries link to the Plasmid Data Page (see description below). Plasmid search results can be sorted or filtered with check-box toggles to the right of the results. A flame icon indicates if a plasmid has been requested more than 20 (yellow), 50 (red) or 100 (blue) times. This information is provided because the popularity of a plasmid is one indication of its usefulness and level of experimental validation.  

If the name of a PI is used in the ‘Search for Plasmids’ box, the first results will be links to the Lab Plasmid Pages of depositors with that last name. A customized, public Lab Plasmid Page is generated for each depositing PI or lab head. A link back to the depositing lab’s webpage on their university site is displayed here. Deposited plasmids can be browsed on the Lab Plasmid Page in lists organized by plasmid name or, alternatively, by the associated publication. HTML code is also provided to make it easy to post a link from the institutional lab website to their corresponding Addgene Lab Plasmid page. This makes it simple for other scientists to find plasmid-associated data.  

# Plasmid data page  

Each plasmid in the collection has a unique Addgene Accession number and Plasmid Data Page (Figure 3). The Plasmid Data Page first displays the depositing laboratory and the associated publication, if applicable. The ‘Purpose field information is provided by depositors or by Addgene Repository curators. It describes, in simple terms, a suggested experimental use for the plasmid. This field can be particularly helpful when scientists are comparing similar reagents to decide on what will work best for their planned experiments. The Plasmid Data Page displays details of the backbone, growth conditions, gene inserts and cloning information for each inserted sequence. Any additional documents that have been provided by the depositing scientist, such as protocols or maps, can be found under ‘Resource Information’. Maps for the Plasmid Data Page are constructed based on available sequence information. Some sequences might be partial or insert-only sequence. Actual or predicted full sequence is available for some plasmids. From the ‘View all sequences’ link on the Plasmid Data page, users can access a simple analysis tool for basic sequence manipulations including feature mapping, sequence download, NCBI ‘BLAST’ search, sequence alignment, restriction pattern prediction and translation.  

At the bottom of the Plasmid Data Page, recommended citation text is displayed. This text can be used to cite the plasmid in the methods and references sections of a publication resulting from experiments done with a requested reagent. Every effort has been made to make plasmid citation as easy as possible to ensure the depositing scientists are acknowledged when their materials are used in published studies. Citation is required by the terms of every request to acknowledge the depositing scientist. Future requestors find it helpful when the Addgene Accession number is included in the publication. One of the many advantages of sharing materials through a repository is that this sharing has been demonstrated to increase the number of citations of the original publication in which the reagent appeared (13).  

# PI and Technology Transfer Office (TTO) account pages  

Each depositing scientist is provided with access to a password protected PI Account Page. The PI Account Page lists all requests made for that lab’s deposited plasmids including the material requested, the date of the request, the requesting PI and their institution. The PI also has the option to receive daily, weekly or monthly email updates with this information. Easy access to plasmid distribution information allows depositors to connect with requesting scientists who may become future collaborators. In addition, depositors can use these data in grant applications to comply with ‘resource sharing plan’ requirements.  

The TTO for each organization is provided with access to a password protected TTO Account Page. This page displays an inventory of all materials deposited by labs at this organization and allows TTOs to manage organizational contacts and reporting options. TTOs can view a log of all plasmids distributed on their behalf. The TTO Account Page also provides information on all plasmid requests fulfilled for their organization through the Addgene Repository.  

# PLASMID INFORMATION RESOURCES  

The Addgene website contains extensive support information for using and requesting materials from the database (for example, addgene.org/faq). Addgene also has a team of molecular biologists available to help scientists find appropriate reagents. As the size of the Addgene database has increased over the years, so have the number of technical service questions. Realizing that the breadth of technical support questions provides good insight into the information scientists need to plan and carry out plasmid cloning projects, the Addgene Repository scientists have responded by creating a substantial amount of educational content for the community.  

In addition to the detailed guides for specific collections (Table 1), Addgene Repository scientists have developed broad educational resources and reference information for the molecular biologist (addgene.org/plasmid reference). The Molecular Cloning Guide includes an ever growing series of protocols for molecular biology procedures including cloning, plasmid analysis, bacterial culture, DNA purification and nucleic acid quantification. Additional protocols for plasmid handling and analysis can be found under the Protocols for Addgene Plasmids section, including how to treat requested plasmids when you receive them. The Molecular Biology Tools and Resources section has basic information, such as a listing of common bacterial strains and a table of common epitope tags. One  

# Caddgene  

Thenonprofitplasmidrepository of the most accessed reference guides is a digital collection of over 4000 vector backbones assembled from publications and commercially available sources called Vector Database (addgene.org/vector-database). Vector Database, along with the Addgene Guide to Choosing a Perfect Backbone (addgene.org/empty backbones), helps scientists find and select plasmid starting points for their plasmid constructs.

Figure 3. The Addgene Plasmid Page. Each plasmid has a unique information page. See text for details on the different informational sections.  

In late 2013, the Addgene Repository launched a blog to enable rapid publishing of timely informational and educational articles for the scientific community (blog.addgene.  

org). Addgene Scientists write content for the blog, ‘A Better Way to Share Science’, and excellent contributions are provided by guest bloggers. Topics include highlights of new plasmids in the repository, technical tips on plasmid design, editorial viewpoints on current topics in science, as well as career content of interest to science trainees and their mentors.  

# OUTCOMES  

The Addgene Repository’s distribution service can influence uptake and dissemination of new technologies. One example of this is how rapidly labs have been able to design and carry out experiments related to the growing field of CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering (14,15). Over 25,000 CRISPR/Cas9-associated plasmids have been distributed since the first papers describing the use of this technology were published in late 2012 and early 2013 (16–19). The dedication of this research community to sharing materials and information has accelerated research on this promising technology. A recent search on Google Scholar (http: //scholar.google.com) for the terms ‘addgene AND crispr returned almost 500 publication results in just 2 years.  

The repository distributed ${\tt>}94{,}000$ plasmids in 2013 and is on track to distribute over 115,000 in 2014. The proportion of plasmids distributed internationally has steadily increased such that over half of all requests are now from outside the United States. The Addgene Repository is proud to be helping scientists share plasmids and data in all 50 of the United States and in 79 countries internationally. The mission to improve access to useful research materials includes a focus on helping all scientists share plasmids and data wherever they are located. The richness and scale of the library and database will make it possible for the Addgene Repository to continue to grow its community of collaborative scientists.

# ABSTRACT  

Gaining information about structural and functional features of newly identified proteins is often a difficult task. This information is crucial for understanding sequence–structure–function relationships of target proteins and, thus, essential in comprehending the mechanisms and dynamics of the molecular systems of interest. Using protein energy profiles is a novel approach that can contribute in addressing such problems. An energy profile corresponds to the sequence of energy values that are derived from a coarse-grained energy model. Energy profiles can be computed from protein structures or predicted from sequences. As shown, correspondences and dissimilarities in energy profiles can be applied for investigations of protein mechanics and dynamics. We developed eProS (energy profile suite, freely available at http://bioservices. hs-mittweida.de/Epros/), a database that provides $\sim76000$ pre-calculated energy profiles as well as a toolbox for addressing numerous problems of structure biology. Energy profiles can be browsed, visualized, calculated from an uploaded structure or predicted from sequence. Furthermore, it is possible to align energy profiles of interest or compare them with all entries in the eProS database to identify significantly similar energy profiles and, thus, possibly relevant structural and functional relationships. Additionally, annotations and cross-links from numerous sources provide a broad view of potential biological correspondences.  

# INTRODUCTION  

The amino acid sequence-based predictions of protein structure features, stability analyses of known protein structures as well as secondary structure predictions are important tasks in protein modelling (1). Several energy functions and force fields that model the protein freeenergy landscape have been developed to address these protein modelling problems. On the one hand, they contribute to protein modelling (i.e. comparative modelling, threading or ab initio folding) and protein model assessment. On the other hand, force fields are essential in molecular simulations and can account for the understanding of dynamics in molecular systems (2). They can also help to comprehend the relations between protein structure and function.  

Energy models can be based on first principles approaches using physics laws. In addition, statistical analyses of experimentally derived structures form the basis for the development of so-called knowledge-based energy potentials (2–4). Although the approaches for computing knowledge-based energy potentials are simplified, they can reproduce experimental data with a high level of accuracy if adapted to a specific problem.  

For example, elastic network models use simplified coarse-grained interaction models and have proven themselves to accurately determine protein dynamics (5,6). In general, the continuous application of coarse-grained interaction models is because of the reduction of system complexity and, thus, computational demands.  

In 2006, Kozielski and colleagues (7) proposed that the sequences of energy values, so-called energy profiles, derived from protein structures by using potential functions can be compared using modified Needleman and Wunsch (8) and Smith and Waterman (9) alignment procedures. They have shown that pairwise comparisons and detected energy profile similarities can lead to the identification of proteins assigned to the same protein families. Additionally, conformational modifications as a result of enzymatic reactions or, in general, protein–environment interactions can be inspected (7,10,11). These studies substantiate the possible fields of application of energy profile-based methods. However, to allow large-scale or even databank-wide investigations, the generation of large data sets is required. Because of the semi-automatic computation and error-prone nature often implicated by all-atom-based models, generating data sets on a large scale, for example, comparable with the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (12), becomes difficult. This holds especially if physics-based approaches are used as proposed by Kozielski and colleagues (7,10,11).  

To allow large-scale energy profile-based analyses, we have developed eProS (energy profile suite), a database and toolbox for energy profile-based studying and comparing sequence–structure–function relationships and protein stability. Energy profiles are derived by using a straightforward coarse-grained energy model, which is suitable for globular and $\mathfrak{X}$ -helical membrane protein structures. In the process of energy profile calculation, spatial and physicochemical information is integrated. As a result, energy profiles can be interpreted as protein-specific representations (see the Supplementary Data for further details). For example, the eProS output of the human angiogenin variant H13A (PDB ID 1b1j) is illustrated in Figure 1. The sequential visualization of an energy profile (Figure 1B and D) is the most intuitive. However, energy-to-structure mappings, as shown in Figure 1C, can contribute to identify low-energetic and, thus, stabilizing regions and properties in protein structures.  

Currently, eProS stores 74 900 pre-calculated energy profiles derived from experimental globular protein structures and ${\sim}1300$ pre-calculated profiles of $\textsf{\textsf{Q}}$ -helical membrane protein structures.  

The eProS toolbox and the underlying eProS database provide various ways of visualizing, downloading and accessing energy profile data. The toolbox also includes database-wide searching for similar energy profiles. Here, the query energy profile can be defined by specifying a structure by PDB ID, by uploading a structure in PDB format from which the query energy profile is generated or by uploading an energy profile file that, for example, has been retrieved from the eProS database. Additionally, an amino acid sequence can be used as input. Starting from this, an energy profile prediction algorithm is used, leading to an energy profile that can be used for database-wide searching. The best matching hits are visualized by the eProS toolbox. Various sources of annotation [e.g. Gene Ontology (GO) (13), PDB, CATH (14), SCOP (15) and Pfam (16)] provide a wide view on structural and functional features of the best hits, which can be further broadened through the reverse annotation lookup provided by eProS. The reverse annotation lookup lists all energy profiles that match with the annotation specified by the user. For example, energy profiles of all proteins sharing the same structural topology or molecular function can be investigated concerning common energetic features that point to their similar structure or function. Thus, starting from a protein structure or sequence, estimations about correspondences of protein function and structural features can be drawn from these results and annotations.  

# DATABASE AND SEARCH TOOL DESCRIPTION  

# Content and data organization  

At present, eProS supplies energy profiles for $\sim76200$ PDB entries that are internally separated into 74 900 globular protein and 1300 $\mathfrak{X}$ -helical transmembrane protein energy profiles. The corresponding PDB flat files, containing protein structure information, are stored in a local directory on the Web server hosting eProS. Based on these files, energy profiles for each available PDB entry have been pre-computed. Energy profiles are stored in files of a specifically tailored format. The following file formats have been defined and are available for download and analyses:  

![](images/aca1b066bec04e2f4b4e47fe54fcbe2e3cfaf8bdb203cac8b6a58f6a454a5849.jpg)  
Figure 1. In this figure, the eProS output of the human angiogenin variant H13A (PDB ID 1b1j) is depicted. In (B) and (D), the energy profile is shown as a sequence of energy values. Colouring schemes for energy-to-structure mappings (C and D) and structure-to-sequence mappings (A and B) are provided. The energy colouring is discretized by assigning each energy value to one of the 4-quantiles in the energetic spectrum derived from the eProS database. This measure is because of visualization and performance purposes. The colour mappings provide insights that can contribute to identify low-energetic and, thus, stabilizing regions and properties in protein structures.  

\*.ep: Tab character separated files with each row containing five columns (chain identifier, PDB residue index, amino acid one-letter code, secondary structure assignment and energy value). The first two lines are reserved for listing the PDB ID and the header row. \*.ep2: Extended \*.ep file. Each line represents a record, whereat the first four characters specify the record type. Record fields are tab character-separated. The following record types are currently defined: ‘NAME’ (PDB ID), ‘TYPE’ (‘TM’ for $\mathfrak{a}$ -helical transmembrane protein structures, ‘nTM’ for globular protein structures), ‘HEAD’ (header row), ‘ENGY’ (energy value for a single residue, the five record fields correspond to the five columns of a row in a \*.ep file) and ‘REMK’ (indicating a comment line). \*.eps: Binary files. This file format is going to be used in upcoming standalone software applications. It is only in use in server-internal routines at present.  

For each protein structure in the local PDB file repository, an energy profile has been saved in each of these three file formats.  

The annotation entries displayed on the detailed view of a protein are retrieved from internal relational databases at runtime. All information provided by the database has been obtained from external sources and related databases. For an overview of the integrated data and their sources see Figure 2. The data integration has been achieved as follows:  

# TMDET prediction  

TMDET is a service that implements a neural network-based method for the prediction of membrane spanning regions in 3D structures (17). For each $\mathfrak{X}$ -helical membrane protein structure present at eProS database, a prediction has been computed. These predictions are essential for deriving an energy profile from $\textsf{\textsf{q}}$ -helical membrane protein structures by using the coarse-grained model (for details see the elucidations given in the Supplementary Data). Additionally, if the user has uploaded an $\mathfrak{a}$ -helical membrane protein structure for analyses, TMDET is applied for predicting the location of the membrane bilayer, and according to these predictions, the energy profile is generated.  

# Pfam classification  

The current release of the Pfam database is available in terms of an SQL dump (16). As for the annotation retrieval, only two tables are required, ‘pfama’ $(\sim2200$ rows), containing the Pfam classifications, and ‘pdb_pfama_req’ ( ${\sim}110000$ rows), mapping PDB IDs to their corresponding classifications.  

![](images/e2df5a50e5226da7eaa810358b090fed55d854d8199976556510276faa400d0f.jpg)  
Figure 2. The eProS database integrates data from the PDB (12) and TMDET (energy profile calculation) as well as the Gene Ontology database (13), CATH (14), SCOP (15) and Pfam (16) (energy profile annotation). Energetic discrepancies and similarities between proteins can be investigated by the eProS toolbox. The energy profile annotations provided by the data integration can broaden the understanding of the relationships between energetic, functional and structural properties. Furthermore, the advanced reverse annotation lookup can be a valuable method to identify functional- and structural-related proteins and study their energetic similarities.  

# SCOP classification  

The SCOP classification releases are not provided in terms of an SQL database dump but as character-separated value files instead (15). According to this data, the following tables have resulted: ‘des’ ${\sim}144000$ rows) contains descriptions for all SCOP classifications, ‘hie’ ( $\sim144000$ rows) represents the SCOP classification hierarchy and ‘cla’ $(\sim111000$ rows) assigns PDB IDs to SCOP classifications.  

# CATH classification  

Two files of the current CATH database release (14) served as source of annotation data, ‘CathDomainList’ and ‘CathNames’. The resulting tables ‘domains’ $\mathord{\sim}153000$ rows) and ‘names’ $(\sim3900$ rows) provide information about assigned CATH domains and names of CATH classification nodes, respectively.  

# GO term annotation  

Of the 44 tables found in the images of the GO database (13), the following are required to gain the GO terms associated with a protein structure: ‘term’ ( $(\sim37000$ rows) containing the GO terms, ‘gene_product’ $(\sim13000000$ rows) containing gene products and ‘species’ ${\sim}890000$ rows) containing species the gene products originate from. The ‘association’ table lists $(\sim770000000$ rows) assignments of GO terms to gene products. To find GO terms matching to a PDB ID, the name of each macromolecule of the entry and their sources (NCBI Tax ID) are required. Therefore, two auxiliary tables have been created $(\sim122000$ rows and $108000$ rows, respectively). However, searching for GO terms and especially performing reverse annotation lookups had caused unacceptable response times because of complex query statements that had been originated in the database development. For performance improvements, an additional table ${\sim}610000$ rows) has been created, which assigns the GO terms to each protein directly. Thereby a speedup $(>5\mathrm{{min}}$ to $100\mathrm{ms})$ ) has been achieved for reverse annotation lookup.  

![](images/f1bc56c729e4977e06f80b249425d1799a39cdc59e9b7c6cd6f62dd14fda1910.jpg)  
Figure 3. The eProS database can be accessed through the eProS homepage (A) by specifying a PDB ID, by browsing the data set (‘Dataset’ link, on the left in A) or by using the eCalc tool of the eProS toolbox (see list in A on the left). The graphical output of energy profile data given by eProS (B) includes visualizations by graphs and a 3D structure viewer. Annotations related to foreign databases (Figure 2) are reported, and they provide a wide spectrum of information about structural and functional aspects of the protein of interest (shown in B). Additionally, annotations can be accessed interactively. By that, the integrated reverse annotation lookup lists all PDB IDs that match the specified annotation and that are currently present at the database (C). From this, the listed protein structures can be investigated concerning common energetic properties that point to their structural and functional similarity.  

# Working with the eProS database  

The eProS and the collection of energy profiles are freely available to the scientific community in a separate download section (accessible through the ‘Dataset’ link at the eProS homepage). In the download section, it is possible to browse the database and inspect energy profiles of interest. For this purpose, eProS provides the access of energy profile data thropugh flat HTML page tables or by automated download programs, such as wget (http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) or similar software. This ensures large-scale downloading of energy profile files and high-throughput analyses. The eProS toolbox permits accessing the data by more sophisticated energy profile visualizations, for example, plotting of energy profiles and viewing the protein structure of interest highlighted with energy value-based colouring schemes (Figures 1C and 3). Cross-links and annotations retrieved from various foreign sources (Figures 2 and 3B) are available. From these annotations, the reverse annotation lookup can be accessed, and, subsequently, energy profiles of proteins matching the user-specified annotation are listed (e.g. Figure 3C). As an example, after querying the N-terminal domain of the riboflavin synthase by specifying its PDB ID (1pkv) at the eProS home page (Figure 3A), the corresponding energy data and structure as well as the related annotations are listed (Figure 3B). Reverse annotation lookup is accessed by clicking the annotation of choice, which leads to the list of energy profile data available at eProS that share the specified annotation, in this case riboflavin synthase activity (Figure 3C).  

Further methods have been implemented and integrated into the toolbox that allow energy profile analysis, calculation, sequence-based prediction and a database-wide searching for identical or similar energy profiles. An overview of these tools and the implemented data flow is given in Figure 5. The following elucidations explain these tools briefly:  

![](images/515af957304c33247f738502617a7ae497cb9516160b86e23292496fbd61b5ee.jpg)  
Figure 4. eSearch is a tool that provides eProS-wide searching for similar protein energy profiles. It can be queried (A) by specifying an energy profile by its PDB ID, by uploading structure from which the corresponding energy profile is subsequently computed or by specifying a sequence. In the last case, an energy profile (eGOR) is applied. Because of long com puting times, the user has to enter a valid e-mail address. Access to previous direct-links session ids sent by e-mail. eSearch results are given as lists that are ranked according to derived dista er rofile alignment and, thus, energy profile similarity thioredoxin has been queried, leading to a 3hhv) ation is given. With respect to the ed by reverse annotation lookup, can be detected tha all identified energy profiles, including 3hhv. From this, GO-term 3hh osed  

downloaded for further analyses or reused as input for the eProS toolbox.  

# eAlign  

This tool provides modified Needleman Wunsch (8) and Smith-Waterman-like (9) alignment procedures for computing pairwise energy profile alignments. Generated alignments are presented as graphs, ASCII-formatted texts as well as dotplots in which energetic identities and similarities are highlighted. In addition, eAlign computes a so-called distance Score (dScore). The dScore gives a hint about the energy profile similarity observed in the alignment (see the Supplementary Data for details).  

# eGOR  

Adopted to the concepts and implementations of protein secondary structure prediction (e.g. GOR I–V) discussed by Garnier and colleagues (18–20), eGOR applies information theory-based methods and knowledge derived from known energy profiles to predict a residues energy value according to its sequence neighbourhood composition. This algorithm is the basis for the eGOR tool, and it allows the prediction of an energy profile starting from a user-specified sequence.  

# eCalc  

eCalc provides the energy profile computation. On the one hand, a PDB ID can be specified, and the corresponding energy profile data are displayed if they are present in the database. If this is not the case, the corresponding coordinates are retrieved from the PDB, and the energy profile is computed. On the other hand, the user can upload a protein structure from which the energy profile is generated, subsequently. The output can be investigated,  

# eMut  

This tool visualizes the energetic similarities and dissimilarities of proteins of the same length. Thus, analysis of, for example, (point-)mutated proteins, structure trajectories obtained from molecular dynamics or coarse-grained dynamics simulations or influences of temperature variations on protein stability is supported by eMut.  

# eSearch  

The eSearch tool facilitates database-wide searching for identifying similar energy profiles to a query. The query energy profile can be specified in various ways. First of all, eSearch enables searching by a user-specified PDB ID. Additionally, the user can provide a protein structure (e.g. a structure model) by uploading the coordinate data in PDB format from which the energy profile is generated and queried to the eProS database. Third, an energy profile file can be uploaded, which has been generated by means of eCalc, eGOR or which has been retrieved from the database.  

In the process, pairwise alignments of the query energy profile to all entries of the specified entry set (e.g. globular proteins or $\mathfrak{X}$ -helical membrane proteins) are generated. From each alignment, the corresponding dScore is heuristically computed and recorded. This process requires ${\sim}3\mathrm{h}$ of computation for querying an average-sized protein structure ( $\approx120$ amino acids) to the set of globular protein energy profiles. Because of the time demands, the user has to specify a valid e-mail address to run an eSearch query. After the computation has finished, an e-mail is sent to the user, which provides a link to the result session as well as a session id. The results are presented as an interactive list ranked according to the derived dScores. An example of using eSearch is illustrated in Figure 4. In this case, the energy profile of Trypanosoma brucei brucei thioredoxin (PDB ID 1r26) has been queried, and numerous similar energy profiles have been identified (Figure 4A and B). As a representative example for the general observations that can be made from this query, the energy profile alignment to the ninth match (PDB ID 3hhv) indicates numerous global energetic correspondences (Figure 4C). As shown, the best matching energy values are located in the first helix and second strand in both structures. By using the reverse annotation lookup of functional annotations (e.g. ‘cell redox homeostasis’ and ‘glycerol ether metabolic process’) and structural annotations (e.g. ‘glutaredoxin’) of 1r26, corresponding energy profile entries are listed. Note that most proteins present in the reverse annotation lookup list are reported as best-matching energy profiles. As 3hhv has not been annotated by GO-terms; yet, it can be proposed that the GO-terms associated to the best matches can be applied for annotating 3hhv. Furthermore, integrating the profiles reported by eSearch and reverse annotation lookup to the analyses, the energetic properties can be identified that are responsible for stabilizing the fold. For example, mainly low-energetic residues can be found in the second strand (Figure 4C). In contrast, the third strand is consisting of residues with alternating energy values. Both observations are in agreement in all proteins sharing this topology. On the other hand, functional energetic features might be basically corresponding to residues located in the first helix and second strand, as these residues are found to be energetically conserved in all energy profiles listed by the functional reverse annotation lookup.  

In a similar way, the functional clarification of protein structures of unknown function can be facilitated.  

# similar energy profiles  

![](images/15e76457f03c17af0a5dafaa0e37712a605b17311e529a80bfab1fd6cf1f18f9.jpg)  
Figure 5. The eProS toolbox affords several, interconnected methods for accessing and working with the eProS database. Besides energy profile data access and calculation (eCalc), methods for predicting (eGOR) and aligning (eAlign) energy profiles have been implemented. These techniques can be used to derive or retrieve energy data that can be queried for at the eProS database (eSearch). Identified significantly similar energy profiles can be further investigated. Provided annotations and detected similarities can aid in understanding the dynamics and functional aspects of the protein of interest.  

# CONCLUSION  

The analyses of proteins based on energy profiles can contribute in understanding correspondences of protein sequence to structure, stability and function (7,10,11,21). However, the generation of large scale databases of energy profiles derived from physics-based approaches is difficult to automatize, error-prone and slow. The eProS database and the eProS toolbox provide energy profile-based calculation, analysis, prediction and comparison of protein energy profiles computed using a coarse-grained energy model. Cross-links and annotations, which are related to structure and annotation databases, provide a wide information spectrum of the protein of interest. eProS also provides reverse lookup techniques for browsing energy profiles that match a user-specified annotation of the investigated protein. From this, energetic similarities can be identified that might correspond to structural and functional features (see Figure S1 for an illustration). Such insights can be helpful for coarse-grained analyses of protein dynamics and protein–protein interactions. Additionally, the investigation of protein families on the basis of energy profiles can contribute to elucidate family memberships and functional variability. Especially the eGOR algorithm provided by the eProS toolbox can aid in approaching such biological questions.  

Future developments of eProS are going to include the improvement of time-performance of eSearch. Additionally, implementing cross-links between energy profile data will provide a more user-friendly data access. Furthermore, an automated energy profile and annotation retrieval system is currently work in progress. This system is going to be capable of updating the eProS database automatically on a weekly or monthly basis. At the moment, an approach for predicting the topology of an $\textsf{\textsf{Q}}$ -helical membrane protein based on its predicted energy profile is under evaluation and will be integrated to the toolbox.

# ABSTRACT  

The Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program is a national consortium funded by the NIH to generate a diverse and extensive reference library of cell-based perturbation-response signatures, along with novel data analytics tools to improve our understanding of human diseases at the systems level. In contrast to other large-scale data generation efforts, LINCS Data and Signature Generation Centers (DSGCs) employ a wide range of assay technologies cataloging diverse cellular responses. Integration of, and unified access to LINCS data has therefore been particularly challenging. The Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC) has developed data standards specifications, data processing pipelines, and a suite of end-user software tools to integrate and annotate LINCS-generated data, to make LINCS signatures searchable and usable for different types of users. Here, we describe the LINCS Data Portal (LDP)  

(http://lincsportal.ccs.miami.edu/), a unified web interface to access datasets generated by the LINCS DSGCs, and its underlying database, LINCS Data Registry (LDR). LINCS data served on the LDP contains extensive metadata and curated annotations. We highlight the features of the LDP user interface that is designed to enable search, browsing, exploration, download and analysis of LINCS data and related curated content.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Since the completion of the Human Genome Project (1), increasingly powerful technologies for large-scale multi-omics profiling and integrative data analytics have transformed the ability to gain insights and model the complex and dynamic networks of molecules and biological processes involved in human disease (2). Increasingly large and diverse datasets have empowered team-based research and big data approaches to model complex biological systems and drug action (3,4). Accordingly, systems biology and big data are also transforming drug discovery (5–7). The  

Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) project (http://lincsproject.org/), initiated by the NIH in 2011, aims to catalyze systems-biology approaches to model complex diseases and the development of novel therapeutics via an extensive catalog of perturbation response signatures in a wide array of cell model systems. The current LINCS Phase 2 includes six Data and Signature Generation Centers (DSGCs) and one Data Coordination and Integration Center (DCIC). The LINCS catalog of signatures can be thought of as a data cube, with three main dimensions: (i) the cell model system, including proliferating immortal cell lines, primary cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs); (ii) the perturbation, including small molecules, genetic perturbations, and microenvironment effectors and (iii) the cellular readout, including gene expression, phosphoproteins, epigenetic states, and various cellular phenotypes including morphology, signaling and cell fates, global proteomics, and biochemical small moleculeprotein binding.  

Another goal of LINCS is to develop information management and analysis software tools to make LINCS data accessible and useful to the research community. In contrast to other large-scale data generation efforts, the LINCS DSGCs employ a wide range of assay technologies of more than 20 high-throughput assays, posing a significant challenge to data processing and integration. To accomplish this goal, rigorous metadata specifications and data exchange standards were developed in the Pilot Phase and are maintained and expanded as new assays, cells, and perturbations are introduced in the Consortium (8). LINCS data standards are based on community best practices (9) to enable the linking and integration of LINCS to other resources.  

All LINCS data have been organized via the LINCS Data Registry (LDR) after extensive data standardization and annotations with reference ontologies and identifiers so that all datasets have consistent metadata, enabling their integration and mapping to many external resources. The LINCS Data Portal (LDP) provides a unified interface to access LINCS datasets and metadata contained within the LDR. The LDP provides various options to explore, query, and download LINCS dataset packages and related objects, such as metadata for small molecules and cell lines utilized in the experiments.  

In addition to managing the large quantity and diversity of data and extensive metadata records and reference annotations, the implementation of the LDP and design of the underlying registry were guided by the FAIR principles to make digital research objects Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (10) and by the Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles (JDDCP) (Force11 Data Citation Synthesis Group (2014); https://www.force11.org/ datacitation) to cite (attribute) LINCS datasets to their authors. Here we describe for the first time the LDR and the LDP as the two main resources to manage LINCS data and make LINCS resources accessible to the community.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# LINCS content overview  

The LINCS Consortium produces data through the use of numerous assays and technologies, including multiple -omics categories (proteomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics), imaging, and the microenvironment microarray assay (MEMA), a novel platform for evaluating the effect of combining microenvironment perturbagens (e.g. growth factors, extracellular matrix proteins) on specific biological endpoints such as proliferation, differentiation, DNA damage, and senescence. High-throughput, large-scale assays include RNA-seq, L1000 (A Next Generation Connectivity Map: L1000 platform and the first 1,000,000 profiles: https: //www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/10/136168), assay for transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (ATACseq), fluorescence microscopy, P100, global chromatin profiling (GCP), reverse phase protein array (RPPA), and sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion mass spectra (SWATH-MS). A full list of LINCS assay technologies and assays is provided in Supporting Table S1. In addition to various assays and corresponding data types, the LINCS data matrix expands over numerous cell types and perturbagens. Over 1000 cell types have been used in LINCS experiments, including established cell lines, embryonic stem (ES) cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), differentiated cells, and primary cells. Most are cancer cell lines covering a wide range of cancers such as melanoma, leukemia, lung, colon and breast carcinoma. Additionally, primary cells, ES cells, iPSCs, and differentiated cells are used in numerous disease modeling experiments, such as iPSCs derived from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) patients and the corresponding in vitro differentiated motor neurons. The cells are treated with small molecules (which represent the largest group of perturbagens, with ${\sim}42~000$ small molecules tested), protein ligands, micro-environments, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR associated protein 9 (CAS9) mediated gene editing, or other perturbagen reagents or environmental factors. The small molecule collection covers a wide range of chemical perturbagens such as FDA-approved drugs, tool compounds (or chemical probes), and screening library compounds including those with clinical utility, known Mechanism of Action (MoA), and compounds previously tested in the NIH Molecular Libraries Program (11).  

LINCS data for both experimental reagents and assays are standardized according to the previously established LINCS data standards (8), incorporating annotations from various ontologies, such as Cell Line Ontology (CLO) (12) for cells, Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) (13) for small molecules, and the BioAssay Ontology (BAO) (14,15) for assays. A full list of these ontologies, standards, and associated LINCS data/metadata elements is provided in Supporting Table S2. These data are used to construct the primary DCIC data product, the dataset packages, which contain datasets, their metadata, and any other related digital objects, e.g., property mapping and readme files. These comprehensive, data-analysis-ready packages are available for download as .tar groups from the LDP Landing Pages described below.

# External data sources for value-added annotation and validation  

LINCS data standardization, including reference ontologies, enable the mapping, validation, and incorporation of value-added information from various external repositories, including UniProt (16), PubChem Compounds (17), ChEMBL (18), and Cellosaurus (http://web.expasy.org/ cellosaurus/). A comprehensive list of these external resources is provided in Supporting Table S3. To automate this integration, extract-transform-load (ETL) pipelines were built for the external data repositories including cleaning, aggregation, and data-type conversions before mapping to the LINCS research objects (e.g. small molecules, cell lines, protein targets, etc.). Examples include pipelines that garner MoA annotations, controlled vocabulary disease terms, aggregated bioactivities $(\mathrm{IC}_{50}$ , $K_{\mathrm{d}}$ , etc.), and clinical indications for small molecules and protein targets (see Supporting Table S3). Other pipelines were built to validate consistency in biological annotations such as donor sex, tissue, disease associations, cell markers, culture conditions, and naming for cell lines and other biological entities.  

# Architecture and data processing  

The LDR is the central data repository for the LINCSDCIC and is the primary data source for the LDP. Data and metadata from DSGCs are transferred and processed by the DCIC via a collection of tools and protocols (e.g. Dataset Submission Tool, Metadata Submission Tool, Application Programing Interfaces (APIs), data downloads, or via a Center Website). The process includes data standardization and annotations from external sources (see MATERIAL & METHODS, External data sources for value-added annotation and validation) via a suite of well-defined automated pipelines (specific to the data types), which have several quality control (QC) inspection and validation points.  

All data objects and metadata are then registered into the LDR.  

The LDR schema is implemented as a relational database combining a standard relational schema with key-value store. The key-value store captures all metadata fields and attributes. This design provides flexibility as the metadata standards evolve, with the ability to ensure data integrity using a relational model for the well-defined connections among entities, datasets, Centers, assays, and projects. The digital objects in the LDR include LINCS datasets, dataset groups, small molecules, cell lines, proteins, nucleic acid reagents, and peptide probes. An Entity Relationship (ER) diagram for the entire LDR is available in Supporting Figure S1.  

In order to achieve fluid and intuitive user experience in searching and navigating LINCS data, all data from the LDR are transformed and indexed using Apache Solr, a reliable and scalable search platform. Representational state transfer (REST) APIs have been developed using this Solr index to fetch data for display in the LDP and for public API accessibility (http://lincsportal.ccs.miami.edu/ apis/), as illustrated in Figure 1. The LDP is a multi-tier, web-based application intended to function on a wide range of screens and devices. We have used open-source technologies for its three tiers: (i) PostgreSQL and Apache Solr to store data, (ii) Angular Javascript (JS) for presentation and (iii) Java-based servlets deployed on Tomcat as a service layer. For chemical structure search, we use the ChemAxon JChem PostgreSQL Cartridge (JChem Cartridge 2.6, 2017, ChemAxon, (http://www.chemaxon.com). Supporting Figure S2 illustrates a stack diagram of the LDP technologies and data flow.

Here, a specific selection of the KINOMEscan assay by Subject Area $>$ Binding $>$ KINOMEscan is shown, which contains 163 datasets and 147 small molecules.  

# RESULTS  

# Presentation and usability features  

The LDP is designed to be broadly applicable and of use to both computational and non-computational scientists. The LDP includes several dedicated modules for exploring the complete collection of LINCS Datasets and the various associated objects, such as small molecules, cells, and other reagents and their metadata and annotations. These LDP modules have a summary page and a catalog browser with search functionality and facets for filtering content. For each category of research object, such as datasets or small molecules, the content is organized into dedicated (landing) pages (see below). The hierarchy of pages to organize and search/explore LINCS content is illustrated in Supporting Figure S3.  

Augmenting the LDP is a REST API (http://lincsportal. ccs.miami.edu/apis/) that supports programmatic access to the search functionality and to all the data contained within the LDR. The API is designed to be self-describing with responses returned in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. The API is of primary interest to computational scientists and developers building novel applications and research pipelines. We anticipate the most common interaction to be via the web interface; hence, here we focus on a description of features implemented in the web interface that enhance usability and exploration of the LINCS content.  

# Summary home page  

The entry point into the LDP is an interactive Summary Home Page (Figure 2). It allows users to get a quick overview of LINCS content based on categories, such as their respective methods (e.g. RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, L1000), biological processes (e.g. gene expression, cell proliferation), and general subject areas (e.g. transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics). For example, one can quickly find all binding assays, their corresponding datasets, and the number of tested small molecules (Figure 2). The LDP currently contains more than 350 datasets, almost 42 000 small molecules (including drugs and clinical compounds), and almost 1200 cells. The Summary Home Page links out specific modules including those for datasets, small molecules, or cells, and clicking on each symbol will direct the user to the list of respective objects corresponding to the selections in the Summary page. At the bottom, the home page shows brief descriptions and references for the selected LINCS assays, providing the user with a brief description of their selection.  

# Search functionality  

The LDP provides various options to search, explore, and download the processed LINCS Dataset Packages, small molecules, cells, and other reagents along with their metadata and annotations. Free text search for all content is enhanced by autocomplete suggestions and grouped by various categories. The autocomplete feature is designed to be the primary entry point for exploring datasets and reagents. Ontologies, which are used to standardize and annotate LINCS content (see MATERIAL & METHODS, LINCS Content Overview), further expand the search. For example, while typing text, suggestions for drug names, biological targets, mechanisms of action, disease terms, etc., are made. The LDP also provides chemical structure search, enabling users to draw or paste/import .mol files to find small molecules (and associated datasets) by chemical substructure or topological similarity.

Figure 3. Overview of the LDP catalog: (A) facets for filtering, (B) datasets count, (C) selected filters, (D) search bar for text search, (E) toggle between the views, (F) shopping cart for dataset bulk download.  

Facet filter controls provide simple and intuitive means of filtering search results for datasets and reagents. Facetbased filtering can be used to filter datasets by various categories, such as general study/subject area, assay method, assay name, biological process, center name, etc. For example, by selecting the ‘Transcriptomics’ area of study, the dataset list is instantly reduced to 11 from the complete list of 350 (Figure 3). The results can be further filtered using other facets or keywords. Both text search and facet filters are enabled by rich metadata annotations and the use of ontologies and controlled vocabularies for identifying the reagents and assays. Selecting a filter will automatically display the matching list of datasets, and multiple filters may be combined using a logical OR within a panel and logical AND in between panels. The count of datasets is dynamically updated and displayed next to each filter. The selected filters and search terms are displayed as tags below the search bar, and can quickly be individually removed or all cleared. Combining filters allows the construction of complex queries. Search results can be viewed in Table and List views, which can be toggled via buttons below the search bar. The tabular view, which is the default, provides a summary of each dataset including the name of the Center that generated the dataset, the assay name, assay method, available data levels, and various other summaries (as action links), such as count of reagents (small molecules, cells), link to the source, visualizations of dataset, and a download. Clicking on the dataset links to the Dataset Landing Page.  

# Dataset landing pages  

Among the central features of LDP are the Dataset Landing Pages. Because LINCS signatures are generated via several stages (data levels) starting from the raw data, the Dataset Landing Pages refer to a dataset group that includes all data levels derived from an experiment. LINCS data levels typically range from level 1 to level 4, from raw instrumentproduced data points to derived cellular signatures (Table 1). Each such LINCS dataset group is assigned a landing page by which all relevant information to the corresponding data are presented. The format of the landing pages is uniform across all LINCS dataset groups and currently consists of four sections (tabs): Description, Metadata, Download, and Analysis Tools (Figure 4). The Description tab provides important details describing how and by whom the dataset was generated and processed including a description and protocol of the assay, relevant publications, and standardized keywords. The Metadata tab contains searchable and downloadable information regarding the research objects associated with the dataset, such as small molecules, proteins and cells. Links to relevant external resources are also available in this section.

pipelines, the data are organized into standardized dataset packages. A dataset, in this context, refers to one specific data level (in contrast, the group includes the corresponding datasets for all levels). Each dataset package contains: (i) a readme file with all the relevant annotations regarding the dataset, (ii) the original data files as produced by the DSGC, (iii) the standardized metadata of all the reagents used in the dataset, with one file per category (e.g. small molecule, cell, protein) and (iv) mapping files that associate the metadata and data files. These files are created by secondary data processing, standardization, annotation, and curation (see MATERIAL & METHODS, Architecture and data processing). Because metadata are all standardized with unique identifiers, different datasets can easily be mapped and integrated. The LINCS data packages are available to download via the Download tab. Citations for the different dataset levels are also made available in the Download tab. Finally, the Analysis Tools tab includes a list of the computational tools that allow the exploration and analysis of the dataset as well as links to pre-generated reports containing the results of analyses that have been performed on the dataset.  

To cite LINCS data, we created collections of LINCS digital research objects (DROs) in the Minimal Information Required in the Annotation of Models (MIRIAM) Registry that generate unique, perennial, and location-independent identifiers (http://identifiers.org/) (19). Such collections include data-level specific dataset packages, dataset groups (all data levels), small molecules, and cells. The identifiers.org service, which is built upon the information stored in MIRIAM, provides directly resolvable identifiers in the form of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). This system provides a globally unique identification scheme to which any external resource can point and a resolving system that gives the owner/creator of the resource collection flexibility to update the resolving URL without changing the global identifiers. These dataset and dataset group identifiers are the central component of the LINCS dataset citation record, which further includes the authors, title, year, repository, resource type, and version. These citation records have been incorporated into the LINCS Data Portal and can be downloaded in several formats, making it easy to cite a specific LINCS dataset or dataset group. All LINCS datasets are indexed in bioCADDIE DataMed (https://datamed.org/) and OmicsDI (http://www.omicsdi. org/), which link back to the dataset landing pages via their global IDs.  

# Dataset download and shopping cart  

LDP supports individual dataset download from the Dataset Landing Page and also bulk download using the shopping cart that allows the addition of selected datasets directly from the catalog page. Bulk download is particularly useful to access related datasets, such as those generated by the same assay. The shopping cart downloads the highest dataset level available, which is what typical end users want, and also contains a Python script that facilitates merging the various files into a single file based on the assays and data format.  

# LDP small molecule module  

The Small Molecule Landing Page (http://lincsportal.ccs. miami.edu/SmallMolecules/) provides an overview page with statistics displayed by FDA clinical phase and source, a prominent search window, and links to the catalog (browse) and chemical structure search (Figure 5). Before registration into the LDP, LINCS small molecules were standardized following business rules at the DCIC so that different variations of the same compound (such as salt forms, tautomers, and ionization states), but not different chemical structures (e.g. stereoisomers or geometric $\mathrm{E}/Z$ isomers), receive the same unique ID to enable data integration. Standardized small molecules are currently cross-referenced to PubChem Compounds (17) (via CID), ChEMBL (18), ChEBI (13), and UniChem (https://www. ebi.ac.uk/unichem/), which provides cross-reference to 37 additional public databases. In addition, small molecules were extensively annotated and curated with characteristics including FDA approval status, clinical trial phases, mechanisms of action, biochemical targets, clinical disease indications, and many computed drug-relevant properties. The small molecule pages are integrated with the datasets so that all datasets in which a drug was tested are immediately available and cross-linked. The database also keeps track of the original specific samples tested at the DSGCs. Small molecules can be searched by (drug) name, MOA, biological target, clinical disease indication, and by free text and chemical structure. The small molecule catalog allows browsing and filtering via various facets, including MOA, clinical phase, and pharmacological class. Similar to datasets, each small molecule has a landing page with a unique URL (which resolves globally via identifiers.org). Each small molecule landing page consists of several sections including Description with basic information (name, synonyms, ID, cross-references, various descriptors), associated LINCS and external Datasets (with an overview by areas of study and cell types), and Curated Data including biological targets and diseases. Via the Description tab, a user can also search for structurally similar compounds.  

# Other modes of data access  

APIs. To accommodate users who seek information about a single dataset, as well as computational biologists who can programmatically operate on the data, the LDP includes advanced search functionality, and serves the data in JSON format through an API (http://lincsportal.ccs.miami. edu/apis/).  

R Package. In addition to the REST API, R users can also programmatically access the LDP through the R package LINCSDataPortal (https://github.com/schurerlab/ LINCSDataPortal/). This package provides easy access to all the data and metadata that are stored in the LDP. More specifically, LINCS data packages can be retrieved using a variety of search terms for entities of interest (e.g. small molecule, protein, gene, cell line) and downloaded for any of the available data levels. Moreover, all metadata associated with any reagent used in LINCS experiments can also be retrieved.

# DISCUSSION  

The LDP organizes LINCS content by datasets and metadata categories via different modules that feature catalog and landing pages (see Supporting Figure S3). The LDP provides extensive search functionality, flexible browsing and filtering, and data download. Citation records for LINCS datasets can easily be created, leveraging unique global identifiers. In building the LDP and the underlying infrastructure and processes, particular emphasis has been placed on data standards including the use of ontologies, extensive curated annotations of LINCS content, globally valid identifiers, and easily accessible APIs. These efforts have been guided by the FAIR principles to make LINCS data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (10). For example, LINCS data are already indexed in bioCADDIE DataMed (https://datamed.org/) and OmicsDI (http: //www.omicsdi.org).  

Via its current functionality, the LDP enables a wide range of use cases. For example, if the user wishes to discover all LINCS registered compounds that are indicated to treat glioblastoma (GBM), they can query the Small Molecule Application for the disease by the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) term or Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) annotations; this search returns 26 compounds. These compounds can be filtered by protein kinase inhibitors (via the pharmacological class facet), reducing the list to 11 compounds. Search results can be additionally filtered by approved drug (clinical Phase facet), leaving 9 drugs. The corresponding datasets for any of these compounds, including the complete kinase profile (KINOMEscan) or the transcriptional profile in various cells, can be downloaded. To continue this exploration, as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) could be a relevant target in GBM, one can further filter the list by MoA target through the facet or a text search that will suggest EGFR as a target. That leaves one compound, afatinib. The available datasets and annotations are easily accessible through the compound’s landing page. Any identified dataset can easily be cited via the Cite button on the Dataset Landing Page, and the citation can be downloaded in several formats. In the described manner, LDP functionality can be utilized in efforts for drug repositioning. As another approved drug studied for GBM, but not a kinase inhibitor, doxorubicin (LSM-4062) can easily be identified using a similar workflow. If a user is interested in related heterocycles with trapped quinones, one can search by chemical structure similarity directly in the doxorubicin page. The 13 compounds that are retrieved at $95\%$ similarity include three additional approved drugs (epirubicin, daunorubicin, idarubicin), which are all also DNA topoisomerase inhibitors. These compounds could be purchased from commercial sources and screened for this activity, if desired. For better understanding, the described workflows are illustrated in Supplementary Figures S4 to S10.  

The LDP is the primary access point to all data produced in the LINCS project, including the Pilot Phase and the current Phase 2. As described above, the LDP makes it easy for end users to browse, query, and filter LINCS data based on numerous categories and curated annotations, which were rigorously standardized to enable an integrated view across all LINCS content. The LDP also enables integration with external resources via added links, curated mappings, and external IDs. Content from many resources has been incorporated into the LDP. In addition to the Webbased user interface, LINCS data can easily be accessed via APIs and the R package. Global, perennial identifiers for LINCS datasets, as well as the most important related research objects and their mapping and description by community standard ontologies, are also critical components to ensure the persistence of LINCS data in the future. As the LINCS project progresses, many new released datasets will appear in the LDP, and we will add new features, including user-specific queries, lists, and settings, and further improve the annotations of LINCS content and integration with external data sources. The LDP makes LINCS data widely accessible thus contributing to the success of the LINCS program as a valuable scientific resource.

# ABSTRACT  

Small RNAs (sRNAs) constitute a large portion of functional elements in eukaryotic genomes. Long inverted repeats (LIRs) can be transcribed into long hairpin RNAs (hpRNAs), which can further be processed into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) with vital biological roles. In this study, we systematically identified a total of 6 619 473 LIRs in 424 eukaryotic genomes and developed LIRBase (https: //venyao.xyz/lirbase/), a specialized database of LIRs across different eukaryotic genomes aiming to facilitate the annotation and identification of LIRs encoding long hpRNAs and siRNAs. LIRBase houses a comprehensive collection of LIRs identified in a wide range of eukaryotic genomes. In addition, LIRBase not only allows users to browse and search the identified LIRs in any eukaryotic genome(s) of interest available in GenBank, but also provides friendly web functionalities to facilitate users to identify LIRs in user-uploaded sequences, align sRNA sequencing data to LIRs, perform differential expression analysis of LIRs, predict mRNA targets for LIR-derived siRNAs, and visualize the secondary structure of candidate long hpRNAs encoded by LIRs. As demonstrated by two case studies, collectively, LIRBase bears the great utility for systematic investigation and characterization of LIRs and functional exploration of potential roles of LIRs and their derived siRNAs in diverse species.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Small RNAs (sRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs with regulatory roles in almost every biological process of plants and animals by modulating gene expression levels (1). The biological functions of the majority of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are a sort of sRNA with the largest quantity and species, remain elusive (1). In 2006, Henderson et al. reported a new biogenesis pathway of siRNAs from long inverted repeats (LIRs) in Arabidopsis thaliana, which was soon verified and characterized in Drosophila (2– 4). An inverted repeat is a single stranded DNA sequence followed by its reverse complement at the downstream, designated as the left arm and the right arm of the inverted repeat, respectively. The two arms are intervened by zero or more nucleotides, termed as the loop of the inverted repeat. It was found that LIRs can form secondary stem-loop structures and can be transcribed into long hairpin RNAs (hpRNAs), which are much longer than typical animal or plant pre-miRNAs (3,4). The long hpRNAs can be further processed into 21-nt and 22-nt siRNAs by canonical RNA interference factors including Dicer-2, Hen1 and Argonaute 2 (3).  

In the past decades, LIRs as well as their derived siRNAs have been extensively reported to play vital biological roles in diverse species (3–11). LIRs were deemed to be able to lead to tumorigenesis in human by causing DNA rearrangements in somatic cells (12). In 2018, Lin et al. identified two long hpRNAs encoded by LIRs with ${\sim}2.8\$ - and ${\sim}3.1\mathrm{-kb}$ in length in Drosophila simulans, which were processed into 21-nt siRNAs (5,13,14). These siRNAs can repress the expression of the Dox and MDox genes, thus promoting X chromosome transmission by suppressing Ybearing sperms. As a result, the two LIRs and the derived siRNAs are critical to the maintenance of balanced sex ratio in the offspring of $D_{\cdot}$ . simulans. In mouse, siRNAs derived from LIRs were reported to regulate gene expression in oocytes (8,11). In apple, a 1489 bp LIR and the generated 21-nt siRNAs contributed to the resistance of apple to leaf spot disease caused by the Alternaria alternata f. sp mali (ALT1) fungus, by targeting five resistance genes (6). In soybean, 22-nt siRNAs derived from an intronic LIR with ${\sim}5–\mathrm{kb}$ , formed by the chalcone synthase (CHS) genes CHS1 and CHS3, targeted other $C H S$ genes to regulate the seed coat color of soybean (7,15,16). Additionally, in our previous study, we conducted sRNA sequencing of the flag leaves of a rice $\mathrm{F}_{2}$ population derived from a self-cross of an elite rice hybrid (10,17) and found that the presence/absence variations of two LIRs (with 15 012-bp and 3013-bp in length) were associated with expression variations of siRNAs derived from the LIRs in the $\mathrm{F}_{2}$ population (10).  

Despite the vital biological roles as identified above, functionally studying LIRs and their derived siRNAs is still a great challenge, since there lacks a database that houses a comprehensive collection of LIRs across diverse species. Equally important, it is in urgent need for a database to facilitate the identification of LIRs underlying phenotype variations in confidence intervals delimited by QTL mapping and GWAS (genome-wide association study), and to allow the alignment of user-uploaded sRNA sequencing data to all collected LIRs, with the aim to identify LIRs encoding long hpRNAs and siRNAs. Although valuable efforts from different research groups were made in the identification of LIRs and long hpRNAs in different organisms (18,19), they only focused on very limited species (20–22). To make it short, there is no database up to now designed for genome-wide identification and annotation of LIRs and long hpRNAs across a wide range of species.  

In this study, we identified a total of 6 619 473 LIRs in the whole genomes of 424 eukaryotes and constructed LIRBase (https://venyao.xyz/lirbase/), a comprehensive collection of LIRs across diverse eukaryotic genomes, with the aim to facilitate the annotation and identification of LIRs encoding long hpRNAs and siRNAs. Users can browse and search LIRs in LIRBase by genomic locations, LIR identifiers, or sequence similarities. LIRBase also provides friendly functionalities to allow users to upload and align sRNA sequencing data to all collected LIRs, perform differentially expression analysis of LIRs or sRNAs, and visualize the predicted secondary structure of long hpRNAs encoded by LIRs.  

# DATA COLLECTION AND METHODS  

# Collection of eukaryotic genomes  

The whole-genome sequences and genome annotations of 77 invertebrate metazoa genomes and 208 vertebrate genomes were downloaded from Ensembl (https://www. ensembl.org) (23). The genome sequences and annotations of 44 plant genomes were extracted from Gramene (http: //www.gramene.org/) (24). The other 95 plant genomes were obtained by searching PubMed and NCBI for featured plant species. As a result, a total of 424 eukaryotic genomes were collected (Supplementary Table S1).  

# Identification of LIRs in eukaryotic genomes  

We tested several tools including detectIR (25), findIR (26), Inverted Repeats Finder (IRF) (20) and Lirex (27) to identify LIRs, and found that IRF is the only tool that was able to identify LIRs with imperfectly matched arms longer than 600 bp. On the contrary, detectIR and findIR were used to identify inverted repeats shorter than $100\mathrm{nt}$ developed based on the commercial software MATLAB (25,26). Lirex was able to identify LIRs with long internal loops, but failed to identify LIRs with long arms harboring multiple mismatches and indels between each other (27). In reality, growing evidence shows that the 3.1-kb LIR reported in Drosophila (5) as well as the 15 012-bp and 3013-bp LIRs reported in rice (10) can only be identified by IRF. As a result, IRF (http://tandem.bu.edu/irf/irf.download.html) was utilized to identify inverted repeats in the genomes of 424 eukaryotes with recommended parameters ( $^{\cdot235801040}$ 500000 100000 -d -f 500’) (20). The first three numbers are the match weight, the penalty for mismatches and indels used to perform Smith–Waterman local alignment when searching for complementary matched sequence pairs. With the recommended parameters, a minimum of $80\%$ sequence matches, a maximum of $10\%$ indels, and a minimum alignment score of 40 were required for the alignment between the two arms of identified LIRs. A maximum of 500 000-nt arm length and a maximum of 100 000-nt loop length were allowed in the identification. Two 500-nt flanking sequences at the upstream and downstream of the identified LIR were also reported. To remove short inverted repeats, potential miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) and Alu elements, the results of IRF were further filtered by requiring both arms of an inverted repeat longer than $400\mathrm{nt}$ , which is the arm length of typical RNAi transgenes depending on canonical RNAi factors to generate siRNAs resembling LIR-derived siRNAs (28). The output of IRF included a plain text file, reporting the genomic locations and sequences of the two arms for all LIRs, and the complementary mismatches and indels between the two arms of all LIRs. The hairpin structures of all LIRs identified by IRF were reported in a HTML file, which was further processed by an in-house R script. Finally, genomic locations and other information of all LIRs, sequences of both arms and the loop of all LIRs and hairpin structures of all LIRs, were stored in three separate files.  

# Construction of the LIRBase database  

The R/Shiny framework was employed to build the LIRBase database (29,30). R is a prominent programming language for data science, which is extensively used in biological data analysis and bioinformatics (29). Shiny, an R package for building powerful web applications (30), has been widely used to construct biological databases and data analysis platforms (31,32). In brief, an R/Shiny application is mainly composed of two R scripts, viz., server.R and ui.R. Specifically, ui.R is used to define the graphical interface of LIRBase to receive input from the users, including data uploading and parameters settings. By compiling R code into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, ui.R was programmed to design the appearance and page layout of LIRBase. Similarly, ui.R was utilized to design HTML widgets such as radio buttons, action buttons, download buttons, checkboxes, and slider input, which function as basic building blocks of LIRBase. server.R monitors all user inputs from ui.R, performs the calculation, and then displays the results in the graphical interface of LIRBase. The source code of LIRBase is freely available at https://github.com/venyao/ LIRBase.  

# Annotation of transposable elements in the genome of Oryza sativa L. cv. Minghui 63  

A manually curated transposon library of the rice genome was provided by the EDTA package (https://github.com/ oushujun/EDTA), which is a comprehensive pipeline for de-novo annotation of transposons and generation of highquality non-redundant TE libraries (33). RepeatMasker (https://www.repeatmasker.org/) was then utilized to annotate the transposons in the genome of Oryza sativa L. cv. Minghui 63 (MH63) with the transposon library provided by EDTA (34).  

# DATABASE CONTENTS AND FEATURES  

# Identification and characterization of LIRs in eukaryotes  

We conducted the LIR identification in 424 eukaryotic genomes across 374 species by utilizing Inverted Repeats Finder (IRF) (see details in Data Collection and Methods; Figure 1A) (20). As a result, a total of 6 619 473 LIRs, including 297 317 LIRs in 77 invertebrate metazoa genomes, 1 731 978 LIRs in 139 plant genomes and 4,590,178 LIRs in 208 vertebrate genomes, were identified and deposited in LIRBase. The median size of LIRs was 3320-nt in invertebrate metazoans, 7910-nt in plants, and 7426-nt in vertebrates, respectively (Supplementary Figure S1). In general, the number of LIRs identified in different genomes was positively correlated with the size and complexity of the genome (Figure 1B). By comparing and clustering 30 423 LIRs identified in five different rice genomes, we found that only 6616 LIRs $(\sim30.0\%)$ were shared by the indica and japonica subspecies (Supplementary Notes and Figure S2). Collectively, further characterizations of LIRs in seven different species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Brachypodium distraction, Brassica napus, cucumber, soybean, maize, as well as rice) revealed that LIRs are highly divergent between different species (Supplementary Notes). A thorough comparison between 6325 LIRs and transposable elements in a rice genome MH63 disclosed that a large proportion of LIRs were formed by adjacent transposons with identical or very similar sequences located in complementary strands (Supplementary Figure S3 and Table S2) (34). Nevertheless, many LIRs were found to be overlapped with proteincoding genes in the genome (Figure 1C, Supplementary Table S3). For about half of all 139 plant genomes, $525\%$ of the LIRs in these genomes were found to be overlapped with genes (Figure 1C). For example, the arms of 877 LIRs in the genome of MH63 were covered by 1113 genes with $\ge70\%$ sequence coverage. A further comparison revealed that a total of 7918 splicing sites of $2340~\mathrm{mRNAs}$ were covered by the arms of 2076 LIRs (Supplementary Table S4). More than half of the 2076 LIRs were overlapped with at least two splicing sites of mRNAs.  

To make all identified LIRs publicly available, we constructed LIRBase, housing a comprehensive collection of 6 619 473 LIRs in 424 eukaryotic genomes. In LIRBase, thus, each LIR has a wealth of relevant information, including its identifier, nucleotide sequence, hairpin structure, genomic location, genomic coordinates of the left/right arm, the left/right arm length, the loop length, the percentage of sequence matches between the two arms, the percentage of indels between the two arms, and the overlaps between the LIR and genes. All identified LIRs across 424 eukaryotic genomes can be searched by the genomic locations or the IDs of LIRs (Figure 2A), which are publicly accessible and downloadable at https://venyao.xyz/lirbase/.  

LIRBase also features online identification and annotation of LIRs for user-input sequences, which is achieved by equipping with IRF that is a command-line tool to detect inverted repeats in user-input DNA sequences (20). LIRBase provides a user-friendly interface to accept useruploaded sequences of interest (Figure 2B). Various widgets are designed to allow users to set the parameters, including the penalty of complementary mismatches and indels between the two arms of the LIR, the maximum arm length, the maximum loop length allowed for the LIR, and so on. The results of IRF, including hairpin structures, genomic locations, and sequences of all annotated LIRs, are displayed on the web page in a table format, which can also be downloaded as plain text files. We further implemented a graphical interface to enable users to search LIRs by sequence similarities using BLASTN in LIRBase (35). Individual BLASTN database was built for LIRs identified in each of the 424 eukaryotic genomes. Searches between the input DNA sequences and one or multiple BLASTN databases can be conducted. The BLASTN results were displayed in a data table, with each row representing a BLASTN hit and containing the alignment details and the relevant LIR.  

# Detection of candidate LIRs encoding long hpRNAs and siRNAs  

Large amounts of siRNAs can be generated from LIRs. However, an LIR can not necessarily be transcribed into a long hpRNA and siRNAs. Alignment of high-throughput sRNA sequencing data to LIRs of a specific genome is the best approach to identification of candidate LIRs encoding long hpRNAs and siRNAs, by detecting the origination of siRNAs from LIRs. Towards this end, LIRBase is also capable to detect LIRs-encoding siRNAs; it accepts high-throughput sRNA sequencing data and then aligns the data to LIRs of a given genome utilizing Bowtie (Figure 2C) (36). For efficiency, the input data should be read count of distinct sRNAs rather than the raw sequencing data. For each sRNA, we allow a maximum of 100 alignment hits, which can be easily adjusted in LIRBase. By default, no mismatches are allowed for each alignment, which can also be adjusted. By allowing a single mismatch in the alignment, we observed a higher A-to-G mismatch rate in the alignment results of three independent sRNA sequencing datasets from Oryza sativa (17), Arabidopsis thaliana (GEO accession number GSM1533527), and Drosophila melanogaster (GEO accession number GSM4990861). This was probably caused by potential A-to-I RNA editing in the double-stranded RNA precursors of siRNAs derived from LIRs (Supplementary Figure S4) (37,38). The whole alignment by LIRBase can be downloaded as a plain text file for further processing. For a specific LIR, the alignment summaries are displayed in a tabular manner, including the number of sRNAs, the number of sRNA reads, the percentage of 21-22-nt sRNAs, the percentage of 24-nt sRNAs, and the total read count of sRNAs aligned to each LIR that can be used to quantify the expression level of LIRs. LIRBase also provides visualization functionalities to plot the alignment of all the siRNAs (Figure 2C), the expression level (TPM) of each siRNA and the structure of LIR. In addition, the percentage of sRNAs aligned to different parts of the LIR (arms, loop, and the flanking sequences) are also reported. All these results can be filtered in a user-customized manner, with the purpose to help users identify candidate LIRs encoding long hpRNAs and siRNAs.

The structure of the LIR is represented by two red arrows with an internal grey loop. siRNAs derived from the LIR are displayed as points with different colors along the arms of the LIR. The expression levels of siRNAs are indicated by their heights along the vertical axis. (B) Correlation between the number of LIRs and the genome size in invertebrate metazoa $(n=77$ ), plant $(n=139$ ) and vertebrate ${\mathrm{\Delta}n=208}$ ). The correlation coefficient (r) and the $P$ -value $(P)$ of correlation test are indicated in each plot. (C) Percentage of LIRs overlapped with genes for genomes of different categories are displayed as violin plot and dot points. The purple cross indicates the median value in each plot.  

# Differential expression analysis of LIRs or sRNAs  

Conditioning of gene expression level is an important approach regulating various biological processes to respond to the changing environment (39). Differential expression analysis of protein-coding genes or non-coding RNAs has been extensively used to identify candidate genes underlying various phenotype variations (40). We implemented a graphical interface in LIRBase for users to conduct differential expression analysis of LIRs or sRNAs between different biological samples/tissues utilizing DESeq2 (Figure 3A) (41). A read count matrix of all expressed LIRs/sRNAs in different samples and a sample information table should be prepared as the input data for DESeq2. The result of differentially expressed LIRs/sRNAs was listed in a data table, which was also downloadable as a plain text file. A volcano plot was generated to visualize and identify differentially expressed genes between different conditions (Supplementary Figure S5). In addition, a heatmap of sample-to-sample distances was created to demonstrate the similarities between different samples regarding whole-genome gene expression levels.  

# Prediction of mRNA targets of siRNAs encoded by an LIR  

It was reported that siRNAs derived from LIRs can trigger the cleavage of their complementary mRNA targets to repress their expressions (5–7). As a result, we developed an analysis module in LIRBase to identify the mRNA targets of siRNAs generated from a single LIR through detecting the complementary matches between siRNAs and the cDNA sequence of protein-coding genes (Figure 3B). Bowtie (36) was utilized to perform the alignment of siRNAs to the cDNA sequences of a specified genome. The alignment result was further processed to report the number of all species of siRNAs, 21-nt siRNAs, and 22-nt siRNAs that were complementary aligned to each mRNA target, separately. The functional annotation of each mRNA was also extracted and displayed in the result.

# Visualization of secondary structure of LIR-encoded hpRNAs  

RNAs can form complex secondary structures, which are critical to their biological functions. The secondary structure of candidate long hpRNA encoded by an LIR is critical to the biogenesis of siRNAs from the LIR. Therefore, LIRBase was also implemented with RNAfold (42), a widely used tool to predict and visualize the secondary structure of RNAs (Figure 3C). LIRBase accepts an LIR’s DNA sequence as input and outputs its predicted secondary structure as a plain text file of dot-bracket notation. The plain text file of dot-bracket notation and the centroid secondary structure in PDF format can be freely downloaded for downstream analysis.  

# CASE STUDIES  

# Analysis of the sRNA sequencing dataset of a rice $\mathbf{F}_{2}$ population  

In our previous study (17), we reported the sRNA sequencing of an immortalized $\mathrm{F}_{2}$ (IMF2) population, derived from a cross between Oryza sativa L. cv. Zhenshan 97 (ZS97) and MH63, which are the parents of an elite rice hybrid Shanyou 63 (SY63). Using the ‘Quantify’ and ‘DESeq’ features of LIRBase, we identified 159 candidate LIRs encoding long hpRNAs and siRNAs in MH63, as well as 201 differentially expressed LIRs between MH63 and SY63 (Supplementary Tables S5–S6 and Figures S5–S7). We next aligned the sequences of 1,805,909 sRNA expression traits identified in the previous study to the LIRs of ZS97 and MH63 (10,17). We identified 1055 candidate LIRs encoding 106 744 sRNAs in the IMF2 population, by requesting each LIR covered by $\geq100$ sRNAs and $280\%$ of the sRNAs derived from the arms of the LIR. Based on the QTL analysis results of the 1 805 909 sRNAs, we retrieved 37 489 QTLs regulating the expression of 34 492 sRNAs derived from LIRs. It was found that more than 300 sRNAs were regulated by each of the eight QTL hotspots represented by molecular markers Bin359, Bin795, Bin903, Bin1556, Bin454 (OsDCL2a), Bin827, Bin1139 (OsDCL2b) and Bin1325 (Figure 4A). The majority of sRNAs regulated by the QTL hotspots except for Bin454 and Bin1139 were aligned to an LIR located in the corresponding QTL hotspot (Figure 4B and C, Supplementary Figures S8–S13). Notably, variations were detected between these LIRs in the parental genome, leading to significant differences in the species and expression levels of siRNAs derived from the LIRs between the parental genomes. For example, the LIR present in Bin827 of ZS97 genome was totally absent from the genome of MH63. As a result, sRNAs regulated by $\mathtt{B i n827}$ were highly expressed in ZS97 but were missing or lowly expressed in MH63 (Figure 4B and C).

# Identification of a candidate LIR involved in disease resistance in rice  

To investigate the expression profiles of LIRs and identify candidate LIRs involved in disease resistance in rice, we reanalyzed a sRNA sequencing dataset published in a previous study (43). sRNA sequencing was conducted with the pathogen (Xoo PXO99)-infected and mock leaves (treated by water) of Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare at 2, 6, 12 and $24\mathrm{h}$ postinfection (hpi) (44). Processed sRNAs of all eight libraries were aligned to the LIRs of Nipponbare in LIRBase, separately. Based on similar criteria used in the analysis of sRNA sequencing data of MH63, we identified an average of 187 LIRs (ranging from 129 to 230) encoding long hpRNAs and siRNAs in the eight libraries. A total of 280 LIRs were identified by taking together the results of all eight libraries. We observed an LIR that was highly expressed in pathogen-infected leaves at 6 hpi but was barely expressed in the other seven libraries (Figure 4D). This LIR was formed by two adjacent germin-like protein $(G L P)$ genes $\mathrm{(LOC.Os02g29000}$ and $\mathrm{LOC.Os02g29010}$ ) (45). A total of 1,278 siRNAs were derived from this LIR, $56.3\%$ of which were 21-22 nt (Figure 4E). The majority of the 1278 siRNAs were aligned to the left arm of this LIR, harboring more than 110 SNPs against the right arm of the LIR (Supplementary Figure S14). Using the ‘Target’ feature of LIRBase, we found that a cluster of $G L P$ genes on chromosome 8 of the Nipponbare genome were targeted by siRNAs derived from this LIR (Supplementary Table S7). This gene cluster was reported to function as a major-effect QTL conferring broad-spectrum disease resistance in rice (46). Powered by LIRBase, these results demonstrated that this identified LIR was most likely involved in the regulation of disease resistance in rice.  

# DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS  

Evidence has accumulated that LIRs as well as their derived functional siRNAs exert important biological roles in plants and animals (5–9). In this study, we built the first database hosting a comprehensive collection of LIRs identified in 424 eukaryotic genomes. We observed considerable discrepancy in the sequences of LIRs between different species/subspecies, which in turn resulted in significant variations in species and expression levels of sRNAs among different individuals. These results implied that LIRs contributed greatly to sequence diversity between different genomes, which may play vital roles in genome evolution (19,47). We chose to remove LIRs related with Alu elements or MITEs from LIRBase by requiring a minimum length of $400\mathrm{nt}$ for both arms of an LIR, as LIRs and their derived sRNAs related with Alu elements or MITEs are distinct from typical LIRs focused by LIRBase (3,22,48,49). However, this may also mistakenly remove a genuine LIR from LIRBase. Nevertheless, LIRBase provides a great resource for comparative investigation of LIRs in different genomes and in-depth exploration of potential roles of LIRs in evolution, adaption, and phenotype variation (Figure 3D). Importantly, LIRBase not only allows users to browse and search LIRs in any of the 424 eukaryotic genomes, but also provides friendly web functionalities to facilitate users to perform various analyses on LIRs and their derived siRNAs. Clearly, as testified by the two case studies, LIRBase bears the great utility for in-depth investigation and characterization of LIRs in diverse species. Therefore, future directions of LIRBase include the identification and integration of LIRs in a larger number of genomes. In addition, we plan to use a shorter arm length threshold for LIRs and remove potential Alu repeats and MITEs by thorough identification of Alu repeats in primate genomes and MITEs in all eukaryote genomes. We also plan to characterize the expression profiles of LIRs and the origination of siRNAs from LIRs by aligning publicly available sRNA sequencing data to all collected LIRs in LIRBase. In addition, more user-friendly interfaces and tools will be frequently updated and enhanced, with the purpose to provide users with more straightforward and interactive functionalities. We believe these features of LIRBase will greatly facilitate the annotation and functional studies of LIRs and the derived siRNAs.

# ABSTRACT  

Single-cell transcriptome has enabled the transcriptional profiling of thousands of immune cells in complex tissues and cancers. However, subtle transcriptomic differences in immune cell subpopulations and the high dimensionality of transcriptomic data make the clustering and annotation of immune cells challenging. Herein, we introduce ImmCluster (http://bio-bigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/ImmCluster) for immunology cell type clustering and annotation. We manually curated 346 well-known marker genes from 1163 studies. ImmCluster integrates over 420 000 immune cells from nine healthy tissues and over 648 000 cells from different tumour samples of 17 cancer types to generate stable marker-gene sets and develop context-specific immunology references. In addition, ImmCluster provides cell clustering using seven reference-based and four marker gene-based computational methods, and the ensemble method was developed to provide consistent cell clustering than individual methods. Five major analytic modules were provided for interactively exploring the annotations of immune cells, including clustering and annotating immune cell clusters, gene expression of markers, functional assignment in cancer hallmarks, cell states and immune pathways, cell–cell communications and the corresponding ligand–receptor interactions, as well as online tools. ImmCluster generates diverse plots and tables, enabling users to identify significant associations in immune cell clusters simultaneously. ImmCluster is a valuable resource

# INTRODUCTION  

With the development of high throughput sequencing technologies, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) has emerged as a powerful tool for analysing cellular heterogeneity across multiple species, tissues and cellular contexts (1). In addition, massively multiplexed single-cell transcriptomics has enabled the transcriptional profiling of thousands of immune cells in complex tissues and cancers (2). As a result, great efforts have been made to collect and curate scRNA-Seq data, such as DISCO (2), scRNASeqDB (3), JingleBells (4) and TISCH (5). The growing availability of scRNA-Seq data provides opportunities for analysing the complex tissues and diseases’ immune microenvironments, such as cell–cell communications. However, subtle transcriptomic differences in immune cell subpopulations and the high dimensionality of scRNA-Seq data make the clustering and annotation of immune cells challenging (6). There is a still lack web resource for comprehensive, intuitive, and user-friendly interactive annotating single-cell transcriptomes.  

A commonly used approach for cell cluster annotation consists of identifying highly expressed genes in each cluster and overlapping them with established marker-gene lists for cell types (7). Several databases have been proposed to manually inspect the marker genes for diverse cell types from available information in the literature, such as CellMarker (8), PanglaoDB (9), CancerSEA (10) and PCMDB (11). These databases provide valuable resources for annotating cell clusters derived from scRNA-Seq experiments. However, the manual annotation of cell cluster-specific marker genes is time-consuming and has limited reproducibility. In addition, emerging evidence has demonstrated that several marker genes are usually expressed in multiple cell types and thus make the annotations difficult. For example, CD44 is expressed in diverse immune cell populations (8), including $\mathrm{CD4+T}$ cells, activated $\mathrm{CD8+T}$ cells and stem cells.  

To overcome the limitations of the manual annotations of cell clusters based on marker genes, there have been a growing number of computational methods for the automated annotation of cell clusters. These methods ultimately annotate single-cell gene expressions with curated marker-gene databases, reference expression data, or supervised classification (12). The first category of methods based on marker genes includes scSorter (13), scCATCH (14), SCINA (15) and Sctype (16), and relies on a set of established cell type-specific marker genes to assign the cell identity in the queried cells. The second category of methods relies on annotated bulk or single-cell RNA datasets as references (methods based on references). These methods use correlation as the most straightforward statistical method for revealing information about unlabelled cell clusters, and the most representative methods are SingleR (17), SingleCellNet (18), scPred (19) and ScClassify (20). Automated cell type annotation methods have been applied in various tissues and cancers. However, a benchmarking study has demonstrated that each method possesses specific advantages over the others (21). Furthermore, due to subtle transcriptomic differences in immune cell subpopulations, the annotations of different methods are not consistent with each other for the same single-cell transcriptome. Moreover, these methods are scattered in multiple studies or tools; it is difficult for users to obtain the reference profiles and select an appropriate method.  

To address these challenges, we introduce the ImmCluster database, which is freely available at http://biobigdata.hrbmu.edu.cn/ImmCluster. Currently, ImmCluster integrates 346 manually curated marker genes from 61 cell types obtained from the literature. In addition, over 420 000 immune cells from nine tissues of healthy donors and over 648 000 cells from different tumour samples of 17 cancer types were used to generate stable immune marker-gene sets and develop context-specific immune cell type references. Eleven computational methods were classified into two types (reference-based and marker-gene-based). In addition, the ensemble method was integrated into ImmCluster. Furthermore, ImmCluster is equipped with five major analytic modules that allow users to explore the annotations of immune cells interactively. Finally, functional heat maps, bar plots, river plots, circos plots and tables were provided to enable the user to easily and simultaneously identify significant associations in multiple immune cell clusters. In summary, we believe that ImmCluster is a valuable resource for analysing cellular heterogeneity in complex systems and cancer microenvironments.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Collection of marker genes for immune cell types  

We queried PubMed with ‘single-cell RNA-seq’ or ‘scRNAseq’ as keywords to collect the studies published in recent years. We manually curated 1163 articles and recorded 346  

canonical marker genes for 61 immune cell types (Figure S1). Moreover, genes were scored by the number of studies in the literature in which they appeared.  

# Single-cell transcriptomes across normal and cancerous tissues  

For scRNA-Seq datasets of various cancer types, we queried the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (22), $10\times$ Genomics, and the National Genomics Data Center (NGDC) (23) with ‘scRNA seq’ and ‘cancer’, ‘carcinoma’ or ‘adenocarcinoma’ as keywords. The species was restricted to ‘Homo sapiens’. Over 682 tumour samples within 41 datasets obtained from diverse platforms were collected (Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure S2A), including $10\times$ Genomics, Smart-seq2, Drop-seq, inDrop, MARS-seq and Seq-Well. The ‘raw count’ or ‘TPM’ expression profiles and the meta information of each dataset were downloaded. In addition, we obtained three datasets of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors from the $10\times$ Genomics website (Figure S2B). To obtain other normal tissues, we downloaded scRNA-Seq data that include ${\sim}330\ 000$ immune cells across eight tissues from a recent study (24). Moreover, we collected another 11 datasets involving ${>}60\ 000$ normal cells across four tissues from the Human Cell Landscape (HCL) project (25).  

# Computational methods for immunology cell type annotations  

With the wide application of scRNA-Seq technology, several computational methods were developed to annotate cell types automatically. First, the numbers of cell clusters in each dataset were automatically determined by the ‘findcluster’ function in the Seurat package with resolution $=0.5$ . Here, we integrated two types of computational methods into ImmCluster (Figure 1B), including the reference-based and marker-gene-based methods. The reference-based methods use labelled scRNA-Seq dataset as the input for cell type annotations, which finds the best correlation between the reference and user queried dataset. SingleR (17), SingleCellNet (18), scPred (19), Garnett (26), ScClassify (20), CHETAH (27) and scmap (28) were integrated into ImmCluster. The marker-gene-based methods rely on cell type-specific marker genes that are publicly available in databases or that have been published, including scSorter (13), scCATCH (14), SCINA (15) and Sctype (16). All these methods were performed by R scripts.  

# Construction of reference profiles and marker atlas of immune cell types  

We first constructed comprehensive reference profiles for distinct contexts for the reference-based computational methods. First, all scRNA-Seq datasets from diverse platforms were quality controlled and immune cells were identified based on known annotations and expression of marker genes (see details in Supplementary methods). The necessary processes were mainly performed using the R package Seurat (29), including the normalization, dimension reduction, unsupervised clustering, and visualisation of cell clusters. Next, the batch effects from different samples or datasets were removed by Harmony (30). Then, the datasets from diverse cancer types, or normal tissues were clustered and the clusters were annotated based on canonical marker genes. Finally, based on the annotated cell types, we constructed cancer- or tissue-specific reference profiles for each computational method with corresponding formats. The reference files are available on the download page.

(B) Computational methods for automatically annotating cell types. (C) Ensemble method is provided in ImmCluster. (D) Four main types of annotations are provided in ImmCluster.  

We next constructed the marker-gene atlas of immune cell types based on the manually curated marker genes from the literature and the reference profiles. Similar to a recent study (31), four filters were applied to this process: (i) the gene was detected in at least three cells on at least three counts across all cells; (ii) the gene was statistically significantly higher in expression in this cluster than in the complement set; to establish significance, we used the two-tailed Mann–Whitney $U$ test with multiple hypothesis correction, false discovery rate (FDR) $<5\%$ ; (iii) gene exhibited maximal average expression in this cluster and (iv) the max-to-second-max ratio for the gene was at least $1.1\times$ . The marker genes for immune cell types were saved as R data and can be downloaded from ImmCluster.  

# Ensemble annotations of immune cell types  

To obtain robust cell type annotations from diverse computational methods, we developed an ensemble annotation method to integrate the results from different methods (Figure 1C). The majority voting strategy was used in the ensemble methods. For each cell, the annotations from different methods were collected, and we labelled the cell with the cell type that had the highest number of votes. In addition, cells with more than two labels annotated as different immune lineages were defined as ‘unknown’. If a cell was labelled with two cell types in the same immune lineages and each type had the same number of votes, we kept both cell types for users. Users can ultimately determine the most accurate cell type based on their knowledge of biology. The markergene and reference-based methods were analysed separately.  

# Cell type-specific expression of genes and functional assignments  

Based on the annotations of immune cell types, we used COSG to identify the specifically highly expressed genes in a cell type compared to other cell types (32). COSG is a cosine similarity-based method that is faster than the ‘findAllMarkers’ of Seurat. The top highly expressed 100 genes were selected for each immune cell type.  

To investigate the functions of cell types, we first calculated the single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) score for each cell (33). The cell states (10), immune signatures (34) and cancer hallmarks (35) were considered. In addition, we performed a hypergeometric test to identify the significantly enriched functions based on highly expressed genes. The genes with FDR $<0.01$ and fold-change ${>}2$ were identified as highly expressed. Functions with a $P{<}0.05$ were identified as significant.  

# Cell–cell communications  

To further explore the interactions between immune cell types and identify cell–cell communications, ImmCluster integrated iTALK (https://github.com/Coolgenome/ iTALK), celltalker (https://github.com/arc85/celltalker), and ICELLNET (36). The integrated ligand-receptor interactions were collected from several databases (see the supplementary methods for further details).  

# Database implementation  

The frontend of ImmCluster was built with HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS, and it includes the jQuery (v3.3.1), Datatable (1.10.25), ECharts (v5.5.1) and D3 (v7.6.1) plugins. The backend of ImmCluster is powered by MySQL (v5.5.21) and is queried via the Java Server Pages with Apache Tomcat container (v6.0) as the middleware. All data in ImmCluster are stored and managed using MySQL (v5.5.21) and it employs Java and R programs to perform online analyses. ImmCluster has been tested on several popular web browsers, including Google Chrome, Firefox, and Apple Safari.  

# DATABASE CONTENT AND ONLINE TOOLS  

ImmCluster provides a comprehensive collection of canonical marker genes of immune cell types and single-cell transcriptomes. Approximately 346 marker genes from 61 cell types were manually curated from the literature. ImmCluster integrated over $420\:000$ immune cells from nine tissues of healthy donors and over 648 000 cells from patients with 17 different cancer types to generate stable immune markergene sets and develop context-specific immunology references. In total, 11 computational and the ensemble methods were integrated into ImmCluster to annotate immune cell types automatically. ImmCluster provided five major analytic modules that allow users to interactively explore the annotations of immune cells (Figure 1D): (i) clustering and annotating the immune cell clusters based on computational methods; (ii) gene expression of markers across cell clusters in the user uploaded dataset and the reference immunology profiles; (iii) functional assignment of the cell clusters in cancer hallmarks, cell states and immune pathways; (iv) cell–cell communications and corresponding ligand–receptor interactions and (v) online annotation tools for user uploaded data.  

ImmCluster is organised into six main pages (Figure 2): Home, Browse, Search, Tool, Download and Help. We provided a global browse function on the ‘Browse’ page to allow users to query the annotations of published cancer or normal single-cell transcriptomes. Users can browse the cancerous or normal tissues of interest via the human body map or the dataset tables (Figure 2A). Annotations of the reference dataset include the tSNE, or UMAP visualisation of the clustering, details of the marker genes for each cell type, and functional annotations of the cell types and cell–cell communications mediated by ligand–receptor interactions (Figure 2B). The search page provides four types of query options for users to search for datasets, genes, cell types, or reference profiles of interest (Figure 2C). The heatmap, tSNE, or UMAP figures can be used to visualise the expression of genes across cell types (Figure 2D). The functional annotations and the cell–cell communications between cell types that the users search for are provided in the result pages (Figure 2E). In particular, ImmCluster provides useful tools for annotating the single-cell transcriptome uploaded by users (Figure 2F). After quality control of the data uploaded by users, ImmCluster automatically annotates the cell types and performs downstream analyses based on the user’s selected methods. The immune cell type annotations for different computational and the ensemble method are then provided (Figure 2G). Details of marker genes, functional annotations in immune pathways, cellular states, cancer hallmarks, and cell–cell communications are provided in the forms of diverse types of figures and tables (Figure 2G). Finally, the download page allows users to download all of the integrated data, including the reference transcriptomes, marker genes and metadata of cells in RDS format. Instructions for each module are provided on the help page.  

# CASE STUDY  

To demonstrate the application of ImmCluster, we comprehensively analysed the colon cancer data from a recent study (37). In the original study, immune cells were classified into five major classes: B cells, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs, major class of NK cells), and myeloid cells (Figure 3A). When we analysed the dataset based on ImmCluster, we found that the ensemble method can accurately recapture the cell annotations of the original study (Figure 3B). The average accuracy of cell annotations for all cell types reached 0.963. The maximum accuracy was 0.998 for myeloid cells. We found that ImmCluster can distinguish the subpopulations of the same cell type. For example, the B cells were further classified into plasma and B-Fol cells. In addition, T cells were also classified into functional subpopulations, such as naive $\mathrm{CD4+}$ T cells, T helper cells and cytotoxic T cells (Figure 3B). These results suggested that ImmCluster can accurately annotate the cell types by integrating various computational methods.  

Next, we identified genes highly expressed in various cell types based on the analysis module in ImmCluster. We found that most genes identified in ImmCluster were validated by previous studies (Figure 3C). For example, JCHAIN was highly expressed in plasma, which was also demonstrated in the original study (37). Moreover, IL7R and CCR7 were highly expressed in naive $\mathrm{CD4+}$ T cells, and GZMK and CD160 were highly expressed in cytotoxic T cells. In particular, we found that ImmCluster identified XCL2 and PRF1 as being highly expressed in cytotoxic T cells and NK cells, respectively, which has also been shown in a recent study (38) but not in the original study (Figure 3C). These results suggested that ImmCluster can identify novel genes of interest and generate new hypothesis for investigation. In addition, we performed functional enrichment analysis based on ImmCluster. We found that genes highly expressed in several cell types, such as NK cells, were significantly enriched in the natural killer cell cytotoxicity pathway (Figure 3D). Genes highly expressed in DC cells were significantly enriched in antigen processing and presentation pathway, which was consistent with their functions reported in a previous study (39). Finally, we analysed the cell–cell communications and found that the interactions were mediated by various ligand–receptor interactions (Figure 3E). In particular, ITGA4–CD44 interaction helps the communications between DCs and $\mathrm{CD4+}$ T cells (39). Together, the applications demonstrated that the ImmCluster database could not only recapitulate findings from the literature, but could also generate several novel hypotheses for further functional studies.

# CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT  

Herein, we presented ImmCluster, a database for automatically clustering and annotating immune cell types based on the constructed reference profiles and numbers of computational methods. To better understand the functions of immune cell clusters, we provided diverse downstream analyses following cell clustering and annotations in single-cell analysis. The expression of highly expressed genes in each cell cluster was visualised and functional pathways of cell clusters were predicted based on gene set enrichment analysis and hypergeometric test. Moreover, the cell–cell communications were identified and visualised in diverse types. In particular, we provided several tools for automatic analysis of scRNA-Seq data uploaded by users. All the results can be returned to the webpage or sent to the users via emails. In addition, users can browse and download the reference profiles and marker atlas for more advanced analysis.  

The ImmCluster database integrated manually curated cell-type marker genes and over 420 000 immune cells from nine healthy tissues and over 648 000 cells from different tumor samples of 17 cancer types. The ImmCluster database also provided comprehensive analysis and visualization functions of immune cell clusters. We compared ImmCluster with public databases and web-based analysis platforms for scRNA-Seq data, and found that ImmCluster provided more immunology datasets and functional analysis modules in immunology (Tables S1 and S2). These results suggested that ImmCluster is a valuable resource for analyzing cellular heterogeneity in complex systems and cancer microenvironments. ImmCluster also integrates 11 computational methods, and we developed the ensemble method to annotate the immune cell clusters robustly. Next, we evaluated the accuracy of the ensemble method compared with individual methods based on 11 PBMC scRNASeq datasets with cell type annotations (40). We found that the ensemble method greatly improved the accuracy of cell type annotations compared with other methods (Supplementary Figure S3).

As single-cell technologies develop and increase the scRNA-Seq data, we intend to update and upgrade ImmCluster continuously. We will integrate more scRNA-Seq data into ImmCluster as new studies are published and more datasets are available. In addition, assigning cell identities to cell clusters generated by clustering is a crucial step in scRNA-Seq data analysis (12). Manual cell annotation is time-consuming and partially subjective. Thus, emerging computational tools have been developed for automatic cell type annotations. ImmCluster currently integrates 11 widely used computational methods and the ensemble method. More computational methods will be provided in the future. We also plan to expand the scope of ImmCluster to encompass other single-cell omics data, such as scATAC-seq (41), scTCR-seq and scBCR-seq. Moreover, spatial transcriptomics can also be deployed for exploring tissue architecture and tumor microenvironment (42,43). In summary, the ImmCluster database provides comprehensive analysis and visualization functions of immune cell clusters, which is a valuable resource for analysing cellular heterogeneity in complex systems and cancer microenvironments.

# ABSTRACT  

ValidNESs (http://validness.ym.edu.tw/) is a new database for experimentally validated leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES)-containing proteins. The therapeutic potential of the chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1)-mediated nuclear export pathway and disease relevance of its cargo proteins has gained recognition in recent years. Unfortunately, only about one-third of known CRM1 cargo proteins are accessible in a single database since the last compilation in 2003. CRM1 cargo proteins are often recognized by a classical NES (leucine-rich NES), but this signal is notoriously difficult to predict from sequence alone. Fortunately, a recently developed prediction method, NESsential, is able to identify good candidates in some cases, enabling valuable hints to be gained by in silico prediction, but until now it has not been available through a web interface. We present ValidNESs, an integrated, up-to-date database holding 221 NES-containing proteins, combined with a web interface to prediction by NESsential.  

# INTRODUCTION  

For many cellular and viral proteins, active transport is required for the journey from nucleus to cytoplasm through the nuclear pore complexes. This transport is mostly mediated by the karyopherin exportin 1/chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1) recognizing the classical nuclear export signals (NESs) of cargo molecules. The classical NES is characterized by three to four conserved hydrophobic residues, usually leucine, and the spacing between them. Several consensus sequences have been proposed to describe the classical NES (1,2);  

however, as we previously demonstrated, they all suffer from poor predictive power in identifying potential NES-containing proteins (3). It should be noted that an increasing number of non-classical CRM1-mediated NESs, albeit still a minority, have been validated in recent years.  

Many recent studies focus on the therapeutic potential of the CRM1-mediated nuclear export pathway. This nuclear export pathway is suggested to be involved in the mechanism inducing the abnormal localization of many tumor suppressors, p53 for instance, in various cancer cells (4). Furthermore, CRM1 has been found to be overexpressed in cervical cancer and critical for cancer cell proliferation and survival (5). As for the cargo proteins, many cellular NES-containing proteins are involved in important processes such as signal transduction, cell-cycle regulation and tumor suppression. Moreover, many known cargo proteins are viral, often playing a role in viral genome trafficking: the HIV-1 Rev protein is related to the export of unspliced or partially spliced viral messenger RNA (mRNA) (6); NS2/NEP of influenza A virus plays a critical role in the export of newly synthesized viral ribonucleoproteins, a complex composed of individual negative-sense viral RNAs and various viral proteins (7); while in adenovirus type 5, several NES-containing proteins were found to be required for efficient export of adenoviral early mRNA (8).  

Due to their potential disease relevance, experimental identification of NES-containing proteins has been an active field of research. Surprisingly, this issue has been neglected by the computational biology community in recent years. NESbase (9), listing 75 validated NEScontaining proteins has been a valuable resource for experimental and computational biologists, with $>100$ citations since its publication. Unfortunately, NESbase ceased updating after 2003 and now contains only about one-third of all validated NES-containing proteins. We therefore developed ValidNESs, in which we organize information on 221 NES-containing proteins compiled from the literature. Moreover, ValidNESs is easier to use and search against, is better cross-linked to external databases and provides a state-of-the-art prediction method in one site.  

# DATABASE CONTENT  

The first version of ValidNESs, made publicly available in June 2012, includes 262 functional NES sites from 221 NES-containing proteins (36 of them are multiple NES-containing proteins). In this version, we updated the collection of NES-containing proteins by compiling another 76 NES-containing proteins (up to 2012) and integrated them with those listed in NESbase (9) and the Supplementary Data of our previous NESsential paper (3), 75 and 70 proteins, respectively. Figure 1 shows a pie chart illustrating the number of proteins by species. In addition to sequence information, we collected a total of 52 local structures containing the entire NES region from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which is exclusively available in ValidNESs. These local structures mainly $(65\%)$ consist of $\mathfrak{a}$ -helix and other extended formations such as bends or loops. This result is basically consistent with the previous conclusion made from eight structures of NES-containing proteins (10). However, we found that $\upbeta$ -structure can be found in 14 NES regions. Interestingly, Nilsen et al. (11) reported the first NES located on a $\upbeta$ -strand in fibroblast growth factor-1 in 2007 and suggested that NESs with similar local structure should be found afterward. The updated data in ValidNESs support their speculation.  

To organize the data, we designed two different tables: one for NES-containing regions and another for NES-containing proteins. For users interested in functional NESs, sequence and secondary structural information (when applicable) can be found in the table of NES-containing regions. There is another table of NES-containing proteins designed for users requiring more information at the protein level, such as subcellular localization and protein–protein interaction. Detailed field descriptions for each table are given in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2, respectively.  

# THE CLASSICAL NES  

Some previous work has defined a consensus sequence for NESs as [LIVFM]- $\mathbf{\sigma}\cdot\mathbf{X}$ -(2,3)-[LIVFM]-x(2,3)-[LIVFM]-x[LIVFM], where x is any amino acid (12). However, we found that $43\%$ of NESs in ValidNESs deviate from this consensus sequence. We therefore defined a short consensus pattern [LIVFM]- $\mathbf{\chi}_{\mathrm{X}}(2,3)$ -[LIVFM]- $\mathbf{\partial}\cdot\mathbf{X}\mathbf{\partial}$ -[LIVFM], hereafter denoted as the ‘NES motif’, containing the region bounded by the second and fourth hydrophobic positions of the former consensus (3), a region which has been shown to affect NES activity strongly (13,14). In ValidNESs, we use this generalized consensus pattern to divide experimentally determined NES sites into two categories: classical if the experimentally validated region contains or overlaps with a consensus match, otherwise non-classical. This definition of classical NES is justified by a dramatic improvement in sensitivity (from 57 to $86\%$ ). We tested the enrichment of this NES motif by binomial test, attaining $P$ -values of 7.4e 64 (6-mer matches) and 1.5e 34 (7-mer matches), respectively. Finally, we generated sequence logos for the classical NESs aligned by consensus match (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Sequence logos for NES sites. Sequence logos generated by the WebLogo server for NES motif matches after removing redundant sequences (with sequence identity $525\%$ ) and aligning the three hydrophobic positions within the motif. In general, the preference for negatively charged residues is lower than previously observed in NESbase. (A) Sequence logo for 6-mer NES motif matches with upstream and downstream 10-mer flanks (227 sites). (B) Sequence logo for 7-mer NES motif matches with upstream and downstream 10-mer flanks (162 sites).  

# DATA ACCESS  

In addition to being up-to-date, ValidNESs provides an easy-to-use search interface. Table 1 summarizes the major difference between NESbase and ValidNESs. ValidNESs provides three search functions to retrieve particular data (or display all by default). Once the user submits the query, ValidNESs generates a complete table in text format ready for download and displays an online simplified table providing links to external databases. An overview of the search and search result interfaces is shown in Figure 3.

aSeventy-five NES-containing proteins are imported from NESbase.  

ValidNESs provides a ‘search-by-pattern’ function with regular expression support to facilitate retrieving particular NESs of interest. For example, Henderson and Eleftheriou (15) designed a Rev(1.4)-based shuttling assay and assessed the relative export efficiency of different types of NESs. This search function allows users to search and retrieve NES sites resembling those with available information on relative export efficiency. In ValidNESs, NES sites are divided into two categories based on the NES motif as previously mentioned. Therefore, users can use the ‘search-bycategory’ function to retrieve the classical NES sites in an extended definition: that is, sites with an NES motif match lying inside or across the boundary of the experimentally determined NES-containing region. For NES-containing proteins, ValidNESs provides a ‘search-by-keyword’ function based on their UniProtKB keywords such as apoptosis or tumor suppressor. In addition to the complete table in text format, protein sequences including NES locations are also downloadable in FASTA format. Step-by-step instructions for novice users are available on the homepage of ValidNESs.  

# DATA CURATION  

In most cases, the CRM1 dependence of NESs in ValidNESs is validated by treatment with leptomycin (LMB), a potent inhibitor blocking the binding of CRM1 to NESs (16). However, 42 $(16\%)$ of the NESs in ValidNESs have not had their CRM1 dependence validated with LMB. For these NESs, some other experimental techniques, such as yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro binding experiments, were used to demonstrate the interaction between CRM1- and NES-containing proteins (17,18). However, many of these NESs, 27 from NESbase for instance, were discovered around the early 2000s. In contrast, only 11 of these NESs were discovered in the last 5 years, as LMB has become widely used. For clarification, we add the LMB information in both the online and downloadable table of NES sites. We also cross-link to PDB in the same table if any structure containing the entire NES region is available. When multiple structures are available, we select the structure with the highest resolution and include the corresponding PDB ID in the table.  

As mentioned above, 75 NES-containing proteins in ValidNESs were directly imported from NESbase. We updated the content in NESbase before integrating it into ValidNESs. This update includes one subsequently discovered NES for BRCA1 (19) and seven updated accession numbers in UniProtKB. In addition, we found nine protein sequences listed in NESbase differing from the current reference sequences in UniProtKB (eight with insertions and one with a point mutation). For these proteins, ValidNESs provides the sequences from UniProtKB and the modified NES positions according to the updated sequences. At the protein level, we provide information on subcellular localization and protein–protein interaction based on the relevant cross-references in UniProtKB. We extracted the GO cellular component annotation for the subcellular localization and imported the protein–protein interactions from four external databases: DIP (20), IntAct (21), MINT (22) and STRING (23). We also provide cross-references to NLSdb, a database of nuclear localization signals (NLSs) and nuclear proteins targeted to the nucleus by NLS motifs (24).  

# PREDICTION OF NES  

ValidNESs provides online prediction of NES based on NESsential, our recently developed NES prediction method (3). Supplementary Figure S1 shows the submission interface where users can input a single protein sequence or a UniProt protein name (UniProt ID) such as IPKA_HUMAN. After successful submission and processing, users can view the prediction results, at both protein and site level, and an easy explanation about how to interpret them. ValidNESs currently allows one single sequence in a submission. For users having large computational needs such as large-scale screening, the standalone version of NESsential is recommended (http://seq.cbrc.jp/NESsential/).  

# DATA SUBMISSION  

We greatly appreciate the efforts of researchers to discover and validate new CRM1-mediated NESs and encourage them to submit their new data to ValidNESs in the future. From the homepage of ValidNESs, we provide a preformatted form, including an example, for submission by email. We intend to maintain and frequently update ValidNESs for many years.  

# DISCUSSION  

The large dataset consolidated in ValidNESs facilitates the investigation of various questions related to NES sequence and function. One interesting question is: why do some proteins have more than one NES? In 2007, Engelsma et al. (25) found a monomer-specific NES of human survivin, a key regulator of cell division containing two functional NESs, indicating that NESs in the same protein may play different functional roles. We therefore assume that distinct NESs in the same protein may be under different selective pressure to be conserved, e.g. some of them could be species specific. To test our assumption, we made an investigation among 28 multiple NES-containing proteins whose homologs are available in HomoloGene (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene). We defined an abrogation of an NES as a mutation which causes the NES to no longer match the NES motif covering the three essential hydrophobic residues. As a result, we found

Figure 3. An overview of the search and search result interfaces in ValidNESs. ValidNESs stores metadata in two tables and provides three search functions to access these data. Once users submit their queries, the search result in text file format and FASTA format (for table of NES-containing proteins only) is generated for download. Meanwhile, ValidNESs also displays an online table for quick browsing.  

13 out of 28 homologous groups containing at least one NES abrogation (see Supplementary Data), demonstrating that the presence of multiple functional NESs is not necessarily conserved in evolution.  

# CONCLUSION  

We present ValidNESs, an integrated, up-to-date database and web interface to the NES prediction method NESsential. To illustrate the kind of analysis facilitated by the data organized in ValidNESs, we summarized the secondary structure propensity of NESs and discussed the existence of species-specific NESs. In conclusion, ValidNESs provides both updated data and an upgraded interface for convenient access to experimentally validated NESs- and NES-containing proteins.

# ABSTRACT  

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) has ushered in a new era of scientific discovery by allowing new insights into DNA-protein interactions. ChIP is used to quantify enriched genomic regions using qPCR, and more recently is combined with next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to obtain a genome wide profile of protein binding sites. Nevertheless, ChIP-qPCR remains an integral component of this technology for quality control purposes, before the library preparation and sequencing steps. In addition, ChIP-qPCR remains more time- and cost-effective for many focused projects in which the DNA regions of interest are already known. However, the DNA oligonucleotide primers needed for ChIP-qPCR are more challenging to design than for other qPCR projects. Here, we present the first public repository for ChIP oligonucleotides that have been verified to perform well in ChIP-qPCR experiments. ChIPprimersDB was developed by manual screening of publications to ensure primer quality and provide additional specific information on the ChIP experiments where the primers have been used. In addition to the primer sequences, the database includes information about the antibody, cells and tissues used in the experiment, information on the experimental design, and a direct link to the original publication. The database is linked at https://umiamihealth.org/bascom-palmereye-institute/research/clinical-and-laboratoryresearch/ocular-oncology-laboratory/chip-primers and hosted at https://www.chipprimers.com/.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is widely used to amplify specific target DNA sequences in various applications. This targeted amplification is achieved by oligonucleotide primers flanking the sequence of interest that initiate the polymerase reaction. Since the invention of PCR in 1983 (1– 3), the method has been widely adopted and modified to suit various purposes (4), including qPCR (5) and qRT-PCR (5,6), allowing the real-time quantification of PCR amplicons. Today, qPCR still remains the most sensitive technique for measuring minute quantities of nucleic acids in research and diagnostics applications.  

The quality of PCR amplification is highly dependent on the specificity and efficiency of the primers. Specificity can be assessed by analyzing melting curves and separation of the PCR products on an agarose gel to verify the correct amplicon size, alongside Sanger sequencing. Primer efficiency is calculated by performing PCR with progressive template dilutions and is a measure of the amount of amplification per cycle. Numerous primer databases have been established to guide the selection of high quality primers (7– 18). Further, publicly available algorithms allow the design of high quality qPCR primers that meet specific characteristics (19).  

More recently, qPCR has been adopted to quantitate the enrichment of DNA fragments in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments. ChIP allows for the quantitation of protein binding enrichment at specific genomic regions, thereby providing a new window into chromatin organization and gene regulation. This method employs chemical crosslinking to crosslink (or ‘fix’) DNA-protein interactions, and the chromatin is subsequently sheared into small fragments using enzymatic or physical methods. The DNA fragments are subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against proteins of interest that bind directly or indirectly to genomic DNA. After immunoprecipitation, the DNA is released from its interacting proteins and analyzed for enrichment by qPCR. Although ChIP-qPCR is widely used, it still remains challenging and time intensive, in part due to the process of developing optimal PCR primers. More recently, drawing a genome-wide picture of protein-DNA interactions has been made possible through the development of ChIP followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) (20–22). Although this method is very powerful, it has not supplanted the need for ChIP-qPCR, which plays a crucial role in quality control before sequencing and validation of ChIP-seq findings. In addition, ChIPqPCR is still used for focused experiments and verification of ChIP-seq findings.  

Designing primers for ChIP-qPCR is significantly more challenging than for other qPCR methods for several reasons: (i) ChIP primers must target very specific regions, thereby limiting the options for primer design. This is particularly relevant for proteins with narrow binding regions, like transcription factors, where primers verified to work for one antibody in a promoter region might not work efficiently in another ChIP experiment. (ii) The quality of the DNA is reduced by the mechanical shearing as well as the chemical crosslinking. (iii) The quantity of available DNA is typically low: frequently $<5$ ng. (iv) Intron-spanning primers are used to enhance specificity in qRT-PCR reactions, but as the template in ChIP is genomic DNA, this is not possible.  

Even though ChIP primer information is provided in the materials and methods section of publications, it remains very time consuming to find suitable primers in the literature. Many publications describe ChIP-qPCR results with mathematical significance, however, the actual fold-change or the controls used prevent a determination of the general suitability of these primers. Alternate or outdated gene names in some publications constitute another difficulty. Despite the challenges in designing ChIP-qPCR primers, to the best of our knowledge, there is no ChIP primer repository/database available thus far. The current lack of a ChIP primer database can be attributed to the complexity of extracting high quality information of ChIP experiments from publications––a process that cannot be automated in a meaningful way. To address this need, we describe herein a database for published and verified ChIP-qPCR primer sequences, curated by manual screening, providing researchers a user-friendly interface to access and compare ChIP-qPCR primers, and get specifics on the experimental conditions in which the primers were used. The database is linked at https://umiamihealth.org/bascom-palmereye-institute/research/clinical-and-laboratory-research/ ocular-oncology-laboratory/chip-primers and hosted at https://www.chipprimers.com/.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

PubMed searches were performed using the search terms ‘ChIP-seq’, ‘ChIP-qPCR’ and ‘Chromatin Immunoprecipitation’ and publications were manually screened for ChIPqPCR experiments. ChIP-qPCR primers were included when the experimental protocol and primer description were not ambiguous and study showed qPCR enrichment over a valid control of at least 5-fold. Gene names were verified with the NCBI database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.  

gov/gene) for correct nomenclature. In cases where old gene names or aliases had been used, the gene name was replaced by the correct name and a note was made in the database entry stating the original gene name used by the authors. Further, the complete gene name (‘Description’) was added, alongside the antibody used, the species, and the cell line or tissue which was used in the experiment. If the authors reported enrichment only when cells or animals that were not wild type (e.g. treated, stimulated, gene knockdown), we stated the conditions in the notes of the respective database entry. The PubMed ID was included and is displayed as a direct clickable link in the user interface opening a new browser window leading to the original publication on the NCBI website. The melting temperature ( $\langle T_{\mathrm{m}}\rangle$ was calculated with OIigoCalc (23) assuming $50~\mathrm{nM}$ primers and $50~\mathrm{mM}$ salt $(\mathrm{N\bar{a}^{+}})$ . All entries were double-checked by two independent researchers.  

# RESULTS  

# Curating database entries of high quality primer sequences  

A crucial part of determining ChIP enrichment at a genomic locus by qPCR is the use of valid controls. It is standard to perform PCR with control DNA in parallel, which can either be derived from an aliquot of the sonicated chromatin before the IP (‘input control’), or DNA from a mock ChIP performed with an IgG control antibody or an antibody specific for a non-nuclear antigen. Either of the two latter methods are accepted as valid controls as described in the ENCODE ChIP-seq Guidelines (24), and data is usually presented as $6\%$ of input’ after analysis. In addition, a primer set targeting a non-enriched region should be used. While some studies use a big change in the ${}^{6}\%$ of input’ value to claim enrichment, it must be noted that without primers targeting non-enriched regions, a high $60\%$ of input’ value is technically not sufficient, even if other antibodies in the same experiment had lower $6\%$ of input’ values. The reason being that the $6\%$ of input’ value highly depends on the amount of DNA that is used in the PCR reactions, while antibodies, including control IgG antibodies, vary widely in their unspecific DNA pulldown. Hence, to curate a repository of high quality ChIP-qPCR primers, we manually screened publications for ChIP primers and only included primers that showed $\geq5$ -fold enrichment over a valid control and a non-enriched region. If no non-enriched regions were used as controls, we only included primers in cases where a $\geq5$ -fold enrichment was shown the same regions following different experimental conditions such as gene knockdown or drug treatment. While lower fold-changes may be biologically significant and are frequently reported in literature, a 5-fold cutoff increases the confidence and quality of the entries.  

# Database structure  

Each primary database entry consists of a gene name/species pair. All gene names were verified with the NCBI database for up-to-date names and abbreviations and corrected if incorrect or out-of-date. Each primary gene name/species entry may have multiple primer pair entries (primer sequences), which in turn can have multiple ‘Antibody’ entries. Each antibody may have multiple entries consisting of the precise sample used (which cell line or tissue), the PubMed ID of the publication (PMID), and notes on the experimental procedure (Figure 1) - de facto resembling individual ChIP experiments.

Figure 2. Example of a search performed on ChIPprimersDB. By default, the search function will search all database fields. A search for Sox2 results in three results, where one is the Sox2 gene entry containing primers for the Sox2 gene. The ‘Show primers’ button indicates that two different verified primer pairs are available for this gene. The genes CASP3 and GLI2 are listed in the search results, as those genes were found enriched in ChIP experiments for Sox2. Using the advanced search function, the user can limit the search to specific fields.  

# Database interface and use  

The interface of the database website by default displays all entries as a list, including the gene symbol, full gene name (‘Description’), and species. Further, each entry has a ‘Show Primers’ button, displaying the number of primer pairs available for the respective genes. By clicking the ‘Show Primers’ button, the database will display all primer sequences for the gene alongside their melting temperatures $(T_{\mathrm{m}})$ , the antibodies used, the tissues or cell lines used (‘Sample’), the PubMed ID (PMID) of the publication reporting the primers, and ‘Notes’. The PMID is a clickable link which opens the PubMed website with the original article in a new browser window, to allow the user to quickly assess the complete information on the experimental setup and materials used for this ChIP experiment. The ‘Notes’ section contains additional information on the experiment, e.g. if cells were treated with drugs, a gene knockdown was performed, or alternate/outdated gene names were used in the manuscript.  

ChIPprimersDB has a search function that reacts in real time to the users input. By default, the search is performed for every field for each database entry (Figure 2). To allow more specific searches, we also implemented an ‘Advanced Search’ option to restrict the search to certain fields, allowing the user to search for e.g. genes or antibodies only. All entries can be easily downloaded by clicking on the ‘Download’ button, which provides a .csv file that can be viewed instantly for instance in Microsoft Excel. To enable users to submit their own published primer sequences, we also designed a submission form to streamline this process. Users can easily enter all the required information and submit the entry for revision by a site administrator, which will check if all quality measures outlined above are met. This will allow this repository to grow organically and for users to get credit for designing quality ChIP primers by citations from the database users.  

# DISCUSSION  

ChIPprimersDB serves multiple use cases frequently emerging when planning ChIP experiments: The direct link to the original publications on the PubMed website allows users to quickly compare the data from different groups and decide on an experimental strategy and a specific antibody, which yielded the best results. Choosing the right antibody is especially important, as there are significant differences in how antibodies perform in ChIP experiments, with only a fraction performing well. Further, searches for a specific antibody allow the users to pick primers for genes that can be used as positive controls to verify successful ChIP experiments. Another classic use case is to retrieve primers for genes of interest. Even if the database does not have primers for certain genes for the same antibody intended for use, the primers listed for individual gene regions are a good starting point and will perform well in many cases.  

The web interface of ChIPprimersDB offers researchers a fast and convenient way to search for quality ChIP-primer sequences, compare published datasets and also submit own primer sequences to foster continuous growth. Together, this repository serves as an important tool for researchers planning ChIP experiments.

# ABSTRACT  

Transcriptomic profiling is critical to uncovering functional elements from transcriptional and posttranscriptional aspects. Here, we present Gene Expression Nebulas (GEN, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/ gen/), an open-access data portal integrating transcriptomic profiles under various biological contexts. GEN features a curated collection of highquality bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets by using standardized data processing pipelines and a structured curation model. Currently, GEN houses a large number of gene expression profiles from 323 datasets (157 bulk and 166 single-cell), covering 50 500 samples and 15 540 169 cells across 30 species, which are further categorized into six biological contexts. Moreover, GEN integrates a full range of transcriptomic profiles on expression, RNA editing and alternative splicing for 10 bulk datasets, providing opportunities for users to conduct integrative analysis at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. In addition, GEN provides abundant gene annotations based on value-added curation of transcriptomic profiles and delivers online services for data analysis and visualization. Collectively, GEN presents a comprehensive collection of transcriptomic profiles across multiple species, thus serving as a fundamental resource for better understanding

# INTRODUCTION  

Transcriptomic profiling, involving both transcriptional and post-transcriptional modifications or events at wholegenome level, is of great importance for uncovering functional elements across the three domains of life, including ‘Bacteria’, ‘Archaea’ and ‘Eukarya’ (1–3). High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (4), which can qualitatively and quantitatively capture any type of RNA, promises to help researchers characterize transcriptome comprehensively due to the capacities of whole-genome expression profiling (5–7), detection of novel RNA forms and variants $(8-$ 12) and genome reannotation (13,14). With the continuous developments of RNA-seq technology, it has become a routine and indispensable approach for systematically characterizing transcriptome across diverse developmental stages and physiological conditions (1,10,15–17). Of note, over the past years, transcriptomic studies have made the leap from bulk RNA-seq to single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), unveiling new insights into cell type classification and cellular heterogeneity exploration (18,19).  

As RNA-seq has been widely used in a broad diversity of species worldwide, a huge amount of transcriptomic data has been generated at unprecedentedly exponential rates, accordingly posing great challenges in large-scale data aggregation and standardized processing. To facilitate more effective reuse, integration, and mining of those data, valuable efforts have been made to construct comprehensive or specialized database resources, such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (20), Expression Atlas (21), Human Cell Atlas (HCA) (22) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) (23). Specifically, GEO, a widely used resource developed by NCBI (24), is devoted to archiving worldwide transcriptomic data (as well as other omics data), yet ignoring standardized data processing and structured metadata management. Expression Atlas in EBI (25), contains both bulk and single-cell expression profiles with unified processing, nevertheless lacking co/post-transcriptional events (e.g. RNA editing and splicing). HCA is specialized in human single-cell expression profiling, whereas GTEx focuses on human gene expression and regulation across tissues. To sum up, existing resources have two major shortcomings. First, none of them takes good account of transcriptomic profiles (e.g. expression, RNA editing, splicing, etc.). Second, they do not well curate and categorize experimental metadata under the framework of biological contexts. Given the large-scale data volumes and heterogeneous types of data and metadata, it is challenging to build a comprehensive database that integrates transcriptomic profiles at both bulk and single-cell levels, accompanying with standardized data processing, metadata curation, and online tools.  

To address these challenges, here we present Gene Expression Nebulas (GEN, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gen/), an open-access data portal integrating transcriptomic profiles under various conditions across multiple species. It was originally established in 2016, along with the foundation of the National Genomics Data Center (NGDC; previously named as BIG Data Center) (26,27), China National Center for Bioinformation (CNCB). Since its inception, GEN, as one of the core resources in CNCB-NGDC, has been frequently updated by importing and processing datasets obtained from a variety of raw sequencing data archives. Unlike existing resources, GEN provides a curated collection of high-quality bulk and single-cell RNA-seq datasets with uniformed data processing and adopts a structured curation model to categorize diverse experimental conditions into different biological contexts. Accordingly, GEN features large-scale integration of diverse transcriptomic profiles and provides online tools for analysis and visualization of both bulk and single-cell RNA-seq data.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Data collection  

A number of high-throughput RNA-seq projects and their associated datasets were collected from several public raw sequencing databases, including Genome Sequence Archive (GSA, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gsa/) (28,29), Sequence Read Archive (SRA, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ sra/) (30), European Nucleotide Archive (ENA, https:// www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) (31) and DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA, https://ddbj.nig.ac.jp/DRASearch/) (32). Only the datasets with median mapping rates $\ge70\%$ for bulk RNAseq and $240\%$ for scRNA-seq were kept for further processing. As a result, a total of 296 RNA-seq projects and 323 high-quality datasets were obtained.  

# Unified and standardized data processing  

For bulk RNA-seq datasets, Fastp v0.20.0 (33) was used for trimming and filtering raw reads. And, HISAT2 v2.0.5 (34) was used for quick alignment to evaluate the data quality, and RseQC v2.6.4 (35) was implemented for inferring the strand specificity of the sequencing library. Then high-quality RNA-seq reads were aligned to the reference genome by STAR v2.7.1a (36). After that, quantification of gene/isoform assembly was performed by RSEM v1.3.1 (37) with default parameters. ‘Raw counts’, ‘FPKM’ (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped fragments) and ‘TPM’ (Transcripts Per Million) values of each gene/isoform were calculated. For circular RNA (circRNA) expression analysis, the cleaned RNA-seq reads were mapped to the reference genome by BWA-MEM (38). Next, CIRCexplorer2 (39) and CIRI2 $\mathrm{v}2.0.6$ (40) were used to identify circRNA candidates by recognizing the backsplicing junction (BSJ) reads $(\geq2)$ with default parameters.  

Moreover, RNA editing sites were identified with the genome from GENCODE v33 (41) as reference. All known RNA editing sites were retrieved from REDIportal $\mathrm{v}2.0$ (42) (http://srv00.recas.ba.infn.it/atlas/). Novel human RNA editing sites were detected by Parallel Strategy of REDItool 2.0 (43). To obtain more accurate novel editing sites, a filtration step was added for non-Alu regions using additional criteria as the non-Alu regions usually have sporadic editing sites. Meanwhile, pblat v1.0 (44) was used to discover the mismatched RNA-seq reads and multi-mapping reads, which were then trimmed to remove duplicate reads by using SAMtools v1.9 (45). Editing sites of both A-to-I and C-to-U were maintained for further analysis. RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org) and SNP files used for annotating high-confidence novel RNA editing sites were both downloaded from UCSC (https:// hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/downloads.html).  

In addition, for alternative splicing analysis, high-quality RNA-seq reads were mapped to the reference genome by STAR. Then, detection of differentially spliced events was mainly executed with BAM files by rMATS v3.1.0 (46). The high-quality RNA-seq reads were mapped to the reference genome by STAR. Each ‘case’ group was compared to the ‘control’ group to identify differentially spliced events, and parameter of ‘–cstat 0.0001’ was used for $0.01\%$ difference, to compute p-values and FDRs of splicing events with the absolute value of exon inclusion level $(|\Delta\Psi|)>0.01\%$ cutoff.  

For scRNA-seq datasets, notably, alignment approach was consistent with bulk RNA-seq datasets, while gene quantification tools varied with the data generated by different platforms/strategies to deal with cell barcodes and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Currently, pipelines for the three most commonly adopted scRNA-seq technologies were as follows (47–49): (i) for data generated by plate- or fluidigm-based protocol, such as Smart-seq2 (50) and SMARTer (Fluidigm C1) strategies, STAR v2.7.1a and RSEM v1.3.1 were used to align and calculate ‘raw counts’, ‘FPKM’ and ‘TPM’ values of each gene/isoform with the parameter ‘–single-cell-prior’; (ii) for data from dropletbased protocol including Drop-seq (51) and inDrop (52), dropEst v0.8.6 (53) was used to provide more accurate estimates of molecular counts in individual cells by barcode corrections, classification of cell quality, and diagnostic information about the droplet libraries; and (iii) specifically for data from $10\times$ Genomics platform (54), CellRanger v3.1.0 (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-geneexpression/software/overview/welcome) was implemented as a one-stop analysis pipeline for quality control, sample de-multiplexing, barcode processing and generation of feature-barcode matrices.  

# Collection of gene annotations  

For all collected species, a wide range of gene functional annotations were extracted from Ensembl (55) and NCBI (24), roughly falling into basic information including genomic location and functional description, and associated terms or ontologies like Gene Ontology (GO) (56). Particularly, for Homo sapiens, housekeeping and tissue-specific genes were derived from GTEx (57), genes were annotated based on Disease Ontology (DO) (58) along with GO, and a gene structure visualization on the basis of Genome Browser (59) was provided. Furthermore, annotation information of editome-disease associations from Editome-Disease Knowledgebase (EDK, https://ngdc.cncb. ac.cn/edk) (60) and RT-qPCR reference genes from Internal Control Genes (ICG, http://icg.big.ac.cn) (61) were also included for corresponding genes, while external links to GTEx (https://www.gtexportal.org/home/) (23), REDIportal (http://srv00.recas.ba.infn.it/atlas/) (62) and GeneCard (https://www.genecards.org) (63) were added to each gene (if available).  

# Downstream analysis  

A series of popular downstream analysis tools were implemented in GEN. For bulk RNA-seq data, four tools were included for different analysis purposes, namely, differential expression analysis with limma (64), weighted gene co-expression network analysis with WGCNA (65), functional enrichment analysis with clusterProfiler (66), and gene regulatory network inference with GENIE3 (67). For scRNA-seq data, Seurat (68) was integrated for the selection and filtration of cells based on quality-control metrics, data normalization and scaling, detection of highvariance genes, linear dimensional reduction (i.e. principal component analysis), graph-based clustering, visualization of cluster assignment and identification of cluster markers. Marker gene enrichment analysis was generated with Enrichr (69), and trajectory inference was performed with Monocle (70). Furthermore, SingleR (71) was employed to infer cell type identity of each cell independently by leveraging reference transcriptomic datasets of pure cell types. Here, reference datasets from Human Primary Cell Atlas (72), BLUEPRINT (73), and Human Immune Cell RNAseq Data (74), Human Hematopoietic Cell RNA-seq Data (75) and DICE (Database of Immune Cell Expression, Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and Epigenomics) Project (76) were used for human cell type annotation, while those from Mouse RNA-seq Data (77) and Immunological Genome Project (ImmGen) (78) were used for mouse cell type annotation, separately.  

# Database implementation  

GEN was implemented using Spring Boot (https://spring. io/projects/spring-boot; a framework easy to create standalone java applications) as the back-end framework. All data were stored and managed by using MySQL (https: //dev.mysql.com; a free and popular relational database management system). To provide user-friendly and highly interactive web applications, web pages were constructed using HTML5 and rendered using JSP (https://jakarta. ee/specifications/pages $/3.0/$ , Jakarta Server Pages, a template engine for web applications). Front-end interfaces were built using Semantic UI (https://semantic-ui.com; a development framework that helps create beautiful, responsive layouts HTML) and JQuery (https://jquery.com; a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library). Furthermore, data visualization was built by HighCharts (https:// www.highcharts.com; a JavaScript plug-in to create interactive charts), Plotly.js (https://plotly.com/javascript/; a highlevel, declarative charting library) and DataTables (https:// datatables.net; a plug-in for the jQuery JavaScript library to render HTML tables). Interactive visualization of scRNAseq data was powered by Cerebro (79). Online tools were developed with Shiny (https://shiny.rstudio.com/, an R package to build interactive web applications).  

# DATABASE CONTENTS AND USAGE  

GEN features comprehensive integration, manual curation and standardized analysis of high-quality transcriptomic datasets at bulk and single-cell levels based on a structured curation model and uniformed data processing pipelines. More importantly, diverse experimental conditions of all incorporated datasets are categorized into more informative biological contexts. In the current version, GEN houses a collection of transcriptomic profiles of 323 datasets covering $50~500$ samples and 15 540 169 cells across 30 species. For each dataset, a full range of transcriptomic profiles including gene expression, alternative RNA splicing and RNA editing (if applicable) are provided in GEN. Moreover, GEN accommodates value-added gene annotations based on differential expression analysis across diverse experimental conditions and cell clusters. Accordingly, GEN provides user-friendly web functionalities and applications for large-scale data query, retrieval, analysis and visualization (Figure 1).

GEN adopts a structured curation model, incorporating manually curated items in light of dataset, profile (expression/splicing/editing), and sample: (i) datasets are annotated and categorized into six biological contexts of general interest, involving baseline, genetic (e.g. mutation, natural variation), phenotypic (e.g. disease, aging), environmental (e.g. abiotic stress, biotic stress), spatial (e.g. organism, tissue, cell type) and temporal (e.g. development, circadian, time series); (ii) Expression/splicing/editing profiles include the main steps and parameters of data processing together with reference genome and annotation details and (iii) samples contain a wealth of descriptive information, including basic information, sample characteristic, biological condition, experimental variable, experimental protocol, sequencing strategy and platform, quality assessment and data analysis procedure (reference genome, annotation file, software and parameter setting). All descriptive terms with controlled vocabularies are extracted and abstracted by manual curation of 293 published articles. In particular, diseases, tissues, and cell types are further linked to controlled terms from Disease Ontology (DO, https://diseaseontology.org) and BRENDA Tissue Ontology (BTO, http: //www.ontobee.org/ontology/bto). More details about the curation model are publicly available at https://ngdc.cncb. ac.cn/gen/documentation.

Figure 1. Database contents and features of Gene Expression Nebulas. Abbreviations used: SC, single-cell; TS, tissue-specific; HS, house-keeping; FPKM, fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped fragments; TPM, transcripts per million. SE: skipped exon; A3SS: alternative $3^{\prime}$ splice site; A5SS: alternative $5^{\prime}$ splice site; MXE: mutually exclusive exons; RI: retained intron.  

Specifically, for each dataset, GEN provides a curated summary of metadata, covering species, tissue, healthy condition, RNA type, sample number, sequencing strategy, sequencing quality & quantity and experimental condition (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gen/browse/datasets, Figure 2A). To manage all collected datasets, GEN assigns an accession number prefixed with ‘GEND’ for each dataset. Moreover, since each dataset associates with specific sample(s) (prefixed with ‘GENS’), manual curation is conducted for all datasets by linking to controlled terms from DO and BTO via sample meta-information. As a result, all datasets incorporated in GEN cover 128 tissues and 46 cell types (originally curated from metadata provided by submitters). Based on these curated metadata, as a consequence, users can conveniently find the dataset(s) of interest. Structured metadata for all collected datasets is provided in a tabular form and also freely downloadable (https: //ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gen/download). Overall, bulk RNA-seq and scRNA-seq datasets involve 30 and 22 species, 89 and 64 tissues, respectively (Table 1). Regarding the specific biological contexts, GEN incorporates 153 baseline datasets, 323 spatial datasets, 83 temporal datasets, 58 environmental datasets, 55 genetic datasets and 148 phenotypic datasets, involving 84 diseases such as autism, cancer, diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus (https://ngdc.cncb. ac.cn/gen/browse/datasets). Not surprisingly, Homo sapiens has the most abundant datasets, involving 192 datasets, 29 942 samples, 70 tissues and 84 diseases corresponding to 11 body systems (including cardiovascular, endocrine, gastrointestinal, hematopoietic, immune, integumentary, musculoskeletal, nervous, respiratory, reproductive and urinary system). More statistics of datasets and samples housed in GEN are summarized and publicly accessible on the statistics page (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/gen/statistics).

# Transcriptomic profiles at bulk and single-cell levels  

GEN provides a full range of transcriptomic profiles characterizing both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations. For all collected datasets in GEN, expression profiles are quantified on both gene and transcript levels by three types of quantification methods, namely, raw read count number, FPKM and TPM. At the bulk level, GEN currently integrates gene expression profiles of 7412 samples from 157 datasets, involving 17 animals, 10 plants, 2 protists and 1 fungus, including Homo sapiens and model organisms such as Arabidopsis thaliana, Danio rerio,  

Drosophila melanogaster and Mus musculus (Table 1). Gene expression profiles can be visualized in heatmap/boxplot charts (Figure 2B). Moreover, GEN incorporates circRNA expression profiles of 456 samples from 10 human datasets. Based on the expression profiles, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are identified between biological condition groups, which can be accessed in tabular form and visualized in heatmap charts (Figure 2C). In addition, GEN integrates a valuable collection of RNA editing events and alternative RNA splicing isoforms in 10 datasets with 574 human samples (involving 18 tissues and 16 diseases) as valueadded profiles on co/post-transcriptional levels.  

At the single-cell level, GEN provides high-quality expression profiles of 15 540 169 cells from 166 datasets covering 22 species (17 animals, 2 plants, 2 protists and 1 fungus), 64 tissues and 42 human diseases (Table 1). To reveal biological functions underlying expression profiles, further downstream analyses including cell clustering, identification of marker genes for each cluster and functional enrichment are performed. To facilitate easy access to cell clustering results for each dataset/sample, GEN is capable of visualizing the clustered cells using t-SNE and UMAP plots, which can be color-coded according to metadata information, cell clusters and inferred cell types (Figure 2D). Notably, in the current implementation, GEN presents cell type annotations for 121 datasets in H. sapiens and 7 datasets in M. Musculus since sufficient cell type annotation reference only exists for them (see details in Materials and Methods). In addition, marker genes for each cluster and gene enrichment analysis results can be browsed and downloaded.

# Gene annotations and expression profiles  

GEN provides an abundance of gene annotations for a total of 1 191 846 genes across 30 species. In addition to basic annotation (such as genomic location, biotype, functional description), GEN integrates value-added annotations derived from transcriptomic profiles, including quantitative (expression levels across different conditions) and qualitative (differential expression patterns between condition groups). For any specific gene(s), expression levels in a given dataset can be visualized by interactive heatmap and boxplot charts, and expression patterns from differential expression analysis (also applicable to the identification of marker genes for specific cell types) are annotated and incorporated in GEN. Moreover, GEN incorporates additional annotations for each gene, including editomedisease associations, internal control genes, and ontology terms (from GO, DO; see details in Materials and Methods). Consequently, GEN allows users to retrieve single or multiple genes by gene name/ID/symbol (https://ngdc. cncb.ac.cn/gen/browse/genes). Based on all collected annotations in GEN, users can conveniently find the genes of interest with specific annotations/profiles and investigate expression patterns across diverse biological conditions.  

# Online tools for data analysis and visualization  

GEN is equipped with a series of online tools in aid of further downstream data analysis and visualization (see details in Materials and Methods). For bulk RNA-seq data, GEN offers online services for differential expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), functional enrichment analysis and gene regulatory network inference. For scRNA-seq data, users can perform multiple analyses including quality control, data normalization, scaling and regression, dimensional reduction, graphbased clustering, and identification of marker genes for cell clusters (68). Furthermore, GEN is able to help users conduct gene enrichment analysis for cell markers, cell trajectory inference, and cell type annotation. Meanwhile, singlecell analysis results can be visualized by Cerebro (79), which allows interactive investigation and inspection of single-cell transcriptomic profiles incorporated in GEN. All these results can be downloaded in CSV and Excel formats and visualized images can be exported to PNG or PDF.  

# DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS  

GEN features systematic integration, manual curation and standardized data processing of 323 high-quality bulk and single-cell RNA-seq datasets across 30 species. It enables easy access to a comprehensive range of transcriptomic profiles, which are critical for unravelling both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Moreover, GEN provides abundant gene annotations based on value-added curation of transcriptomic profiles and delivers online services for bulk and single-cell data analysis and visualization.  

Future directions of GEN include continuous integration and analysis of high-quality RNA-seq datasets with diverse sequencing strategies (e.g. miRNA-seq, single-cell spatial RNA-seq, nanopore long-read RNA-seq) across more species. Also, GEN will be frequently updated by enriching gene annotations based on manual curation of the ever-increasing transcriptomic profiles (13). Particularly, since the field of single-cell genomics is under rapid development, we will keep an eye on cutting-edge scRNA-seq analysis methods and make updates on GEN data processing pipelines accordingly. GEN will also provide online services to accept user-submitted expression profiles with quality control and manual curation. Furthermore, interconnections with external and internal database resources at multiomics levels (e.g. variome (80), methylome (81) and interactome (82)) will be added and enhanced. Web tools for RNA editing profiling, alternative splicing detection and batcheffect correction across different technologies and conditions will be developed and/or implemented in GEN.

# ABSTRACT  

Toxicogenomics focuses on assessing the safety of compounds using gene expression profiles. Gene expression signatures from large toxicogenomics databases are expected to perform better than small databases in identifying biomarkers for the prediction and evaluation of drug safety based on a compound’s toxicological mechanisms in animal target organs. Over the past 10 years, the Japanese Toxicogenomics Project consortium (TGP) has been developing a large-scale toxicogenomics database consisting of data from 170 compounds (mostly drugs) with the aim of improving and enhancing drug safety assessment. Most of the data generated by the project (e.g. gene expression, pathology, lot number) are freely available to the public via Open TG-GATEs (Toxicogenomics Project-Genomics Assisted Toxicity Evaluation System). Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the database, including both gene expression data and metadata, with a description of experimental conditions and procedures used to generate the database. Open TG-GATEs is available from http://toxico.nibio.go.jp/english/index. html.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Open Toxicogenomics Project-Genomics Assisted Toxicity Evaluation Systems (TG-GATEs) (Figure 1) is a toxicogenomics database that stores gene expression profiles and traditional toxicological data derived from in vivo (rat) and in vitro (primary rat hepatocytes, primary human hepatocytes) exposure to 170 compounds at multiple dosages and time points. The toxicology data is composed of biochemistry, hematology and histopathology findings with pathology imaging from the in vivo studies and cytotoxicity from the in vitro studies. The 170 compounds include representative known liver- and kidney-injuring pharmaceuticals, compounds and chemicals. These data have been generated and analyzed over the course of the 10-year Japanese Toxicogenomics Project (TGP), which was a joint government– private sector project organized by the National Institute of Biomedical Innovation (NIBIO), the National Institute of Health Sciences (NIHS) and 18 pharmaceutical companies (Figure 2).  

As specified by relevant regulations, toxicity assessments in the pre-clinical stage of drug development must be conducted using whole animals and cells. In animals, general toxicity in liver and kidney is evaluated with physiological, hematological and biochemical measurements and pathology assessment. In cells, the evaluation of cytotoxicity is conducted by measuring cell viability parameters and morphological changes, often with the use of microscopy. These approaches ensure detection of a certain level of toxicity that might be associated with a given test compound. However, gene expression data is expected to permit the detection of potential toxicities that may not be observable by conventional assessments, thereby facilitating more accurate and predictive decision-making based on toxicity mechanisms (1).  

Over the past 10 years, TGP data had been generated at NIHS, NIBIO and several designated contract research organizations using defined standard operating procedures (SOPs). The resulting data were stored, managed and analyzed in a closed version of the database, TG-GATEs. Open TG-GATEs was developed as a publicly available version of the same database, in which the results of 20 118 GeneChip assays are stored along with associated toxicological data and $25\mathrm{TB}$ of digitized pathology images. Open TG-GATEs is one of the largest public toxicogenomics databases in the world. Using the TG-GATEs data, 36 biomarker sets for specific toxicity mechanisms have to date been defined during project development, and several of these biomarker signatures have been published (2–6).

Figure 1. Open TG-GATEs offers hierarchical access from compound and pathology lists to hematology, biochemical parameters and digitized pathology images. Gene expression data are stored as CEL files, which require software capable of interacting with the Affymetrix data file format. Thus, users will have to convert the primary data into a general-purpose format using various algorithms such as MAS5.0, RMA, etc.

In the present paper, we describe the data structure and background from a toxicological point of view, along with characteristics of the data relating to experimental conditions. We believe that the data and information in Open TGGATEs will allow users to gain a greater understanding of toxicity mechanisms and to develop biomarkers for safety assessments of pharmaceutical drug candidates.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Data framework  

The gene expression data for a test compound were derived from administration of individual compounds at up to four dose levels and eight time points (corresponding to four single-dose studies and four repeated-dose studies). Studies involving microarray hybridization analysis were performed using three biological replicates of liver and kidney in rat. Biochemistry and hematology data from individual animals were also obtained and stored. The pathology images were digitized and annotated prior to addition to the database. For human and rat primary hepatocytes, test compounds were tested at up to four dose levels and three time points using duplicate microarray hybridization analysis. For primary hepatocytes, cell viability data was also obtained.  

# Species and target organ selection  

For many years, the rat has been the preferred animal system for pre-clinical toxicological assessment. As a result, more data concerning toxicological mechanisms and endpoints have been accumulated for rat than for any other animal. Therefore, the rat was selected because identification of gene expression changes would have the potential to explain the mechanistic basis of the knowledge accumulated in this animal. Liver is the major organ for metabolism, detoxification of pharmaceuticals and other compounds. Furthermore, clinically significant adverse effects often occur in liver as well as in kidney. In vitro experiments in human and rat primary hepatocytes were included for two reasons: first, to provide a bridge between the in vivo and in vitro data; and second, to permit extrapolation from rat data to human results.  

# Compound selection  

The tested compounds, shown in Supplementary Table S1, were selected based on literature searches and consensus among pharmaceutical and government toxicologists participating in the TGP. The majority of the compounds were pharmaceuticals with reported liver or kidney toxicity. However, some of the compounds were not pharmaceuticals or known hepato- or nephro-toxins, and instead corresponded to chemicals that had well studied mechanisms of toxicity; these compounds were included as reference chemicals.  

# Dose setting  

For the in vivo studies, the highest dose was selected to match the level demonstrated to induce the minimum toxic effect over the course of a 4-week toxicity study. In principle, the ratio of the concentrations for the low, middle and high dose levels was set as 1:3:10. For the in vitro studies, the highest concentration was defined as the dose level yielding an $80-90\%$ relative survival ratio. However, for compounds that dissolved poorly in the vehicle, the highest concentration was defined by the maximum solubility of the compound. In principle, the ratio of the concentrations for the low, middle and high dose levels was 1:5:25.  

# Animal treatment  

The experimental procedures for the animal studies have been described previously (7,8) and are summarized here in brief. Animal experiments were conducted by four different contract research organizations. The studies used male Crl:CD Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats purchased from Charles River Japan, Inc. (Hino or Atsugi, Japan) as 5-week-old animals. After a 7-day quarantine and acclimatization period, the animals were allocated into groups of 20 animals each using a computerized stratified random grouping method based on body weight. Each animal was allowed free access to water and pelleted food (radiation-sterilized CRF1; Oriental Yeast Co., Tokyo, Japan). For single-dose experiments, groups of 20 animals were administered a compound and then fivw animals/time point were sacrificed at 3, 6, 9 or $24\mathrm{~h~}$ after administration. For repeated-dose experiments, groups of 20 animals received a single dose per day of a compound and five animals/time point were sacrificed at 4, 8, 15 or 29 days (i.e. $24\mathrm{~h~}$ after the respective final administration at 3, 7, 14 or 28 days) (Figure 3). Animals were not fasted before being sacrificed. To avoid effects of diurnal cycling, the animals were sacrificed and necropsies were performed between $9{:}00\ \mathrm{a.m}$ . and $11{:}00\ \mathrm{a.m}$ . for the repeated-dose studies. Blood samples for routine biochemical analyses were collected into heparinized tubes under ether anesthesia from the abdominal aorta at the time of sacrifice.  

The experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the Ethics Review Committee for Animal Experimentation of the NIHS and by the respective contract research organizations.  

# Sampling sites of liver and kidney for in vivo study  

For liver, the sampling site was selected to avoid the hepatic portal vein and choosing a hepatic parenchymal area of the limbic lobe where tissue thickness was consistent. Three tissue fragments were obtained per animal. The center portion was sliced and used as a sample for analysis of pathology. If pathological lesions were identified upon visual inspection, the sampling procedure was repeated at a second location distal from the affected area. For kidney, samples were obtained from the left kidney. Fragments of 1-mm thickness, including a portion of the cortex and medullary regions, were sliced horizontally against the long axis of the kidney using four aligned razors. Three fragments were obtained from each rat. If pathological lesion were identified upon visual inspection, the sampling procedure was repeated using the right kidney.

Figure 3. Time lines summarizing the procedures used for in vivo studies of single- and repeated-dose toxicity. For the repeated-dose studies, only the fina dose is shown.  

# Hepatocyte treatment  

Human cryopreserved hepatocytes were purchased from Tissue Transformation Technologies, Inc. (Edison, NJ, USA) and CellzDirect, Inc. (Pittsboro, NC, USA). Six lots of human hepatocytes were used during the course of the project. The lot information is shown in Supplementary Table S2. Rat primary-cultured hepatocytes were prepared as described previously (9), and were derived from 5-week-old male SD rats that had been subjected to a 5-day observation period after arrival. The lot information of the rat primarycultured hepatocytes is provided in Supplementary Table S3. The detailed procedure for the measurement of cell viability parameters is described in the Supplementary information.  

# GeneChip analysis  

The experimental procedure for the analysis of gene expression has been described previously (7,8), with the pertinent points briefly summarized here. In general, we selected rats of moderate body weight (the middle three of five animals). All CEL data in Open TG-GATEs passed quality control (QC). QC was performed at each step of the sample preparation and at the image-scanning step of GeneChip analysis. A collection of analytical information was checked as the final QC step, including background signal, corner signal, number of presence/absence calls and the expression values of housekeeping genes. The intra- and inter-group reproducibility was also evaluated. If a sample was found to be damaged, it was replaced by one of the two remaining fragments. The QC information is not open to the public. During the course of the 10-year project, two kinds of kits were used in the biotin-labeled cRNA synthesis procedure. These kits were the BioArray High Yield RNA Transcription Labeling Kit (Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY, USA) and the GeneChip R⃝ IVT Labeling kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). For rat and human samples, the Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array and the Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array were used, respectively. The probe set information is obtained from the Affymetrix support materials page, including gene names and identifiers in other representative databases. The probe set information is typically updated once a year. Gene expression analysis, including data QC processes, was performed according to an SOP, which for the most part followed the procedures supplied by the respective kit manufacturers.  

# Metadata in Open TG-GATEs  

The metadata in the database includes the code for each GeneChip and corresponding data such as test compound name, dosage and body weight, as well as hematological and biochemical data (Table 1). The metadata files are stored in ‘Attribute.tsv’ for each compound. Peerreviewed histopathological findings and topography information are also provided in Open TG-GATEs and the archived site (http://dbarchive.biosciencedbc.jp/en/opentggates/download.html). Food consumption data is available only from the archived site.  

# Pathology images and annotation  

The liver and kidney sections were stained with H&E (hematoxylin and eosin) and mounted on glass slides. Images of the sections were converted to digital pathology images using ScanScope AT (Aperio Technologies Inc., CA, USA). The digital images were saved and stored in .svs format, which consists of TIFF format files with associated sample dimensions and other relevant values. The pathological information is composed of histopathological finding, topography and grade. These curated data were originally annotated by each contract research organization and the data were subsequently peer-reviewed by the pathologists of the TGP member companies. The annotation was conducted based on a ‘Pathology Glossary’, a consensus controlled vocabulary for histopathological findings for liver and kidney (http://toxico.nibio.go.jp/open-tggates/ doc/pathology parameter.pdf), which was originally assembled by NIHS. Representative cropped pathology images were assembled in a pdf (‘3. Histopathology photograph collection/list of histopathology findings’ at http://toxico. nibio.go.jp/english/seika.html). Unfortunately, the XY positions of the cropped images from the full-size digital pathology image were not recorded.  

# DISCUSSION  

The term toxicogenomics appeared in publications starting in the late 1990s (10). The concept was expected to enhance the determination of chemical toxicity by improving the prediction and understanding of the mechanisms of toxicity. Before the initiation of TGP, Iconix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (11), had developed its own toxicogenomics database. This dataset is currently available to the public as the DrugMatrix database of the National Toxicology Programs of the National Institute of Environmental Health

The Open TG-GATEs was developed in an effort to be a ‘gate’ to a new frontier beyond toxicogenomics and other fields. Therefore, the gene expression data is stored in the CEL format in order to allow users to select suitable methods (14–16) to covert CEL files to numerical data. At the same time, this file type may render the data difficult to analyze for users unfamiliar with Affymetrix data analysis. To address this challenge, Nystrom et al. have made the data available as a second-party web service called Toxygates (17). The Toxygates site is administered independently from Open TG-GATEs and offers data analysis functionality using preprocessed data obtained from Open TGGATEs (Figure 2).  

To date, one of the major barriers in computational toxicology has been the limited number of public toxicity datasets upon which computational models could be built (18). After the Open TG-GATEs and DrugMatrix data were made available to public, the challenge has become focused on data mining. In addition to data mining, validation will be required at some stage. There are two ways to validate analyses, results or models using Open TG-GATEs data. One way is to (re)-produce the gene expression data using the same experimental conditions and procedures described in this paper. Another way is to use the Drug  

Matrix database where similarities exist in the compounds and models tested. We believe the DrugMatrix database is the most suitable database for comparison with the Open TG-GATEs data, particularly in consideration of its scale, the wide variety of compounds, animal strains and type of GeneChip (Figure 2).  

Since the data was made publicly available, a significant number of studies and reviews have been conducted by agencies/groups outside of the TGP. The first comprehensive review of a comparison of DrugMatrix and Open TG-GATEs was written by Chen et al. (19). Zhang et al. successfully identified a consensus gene network between in vivo and in vitro studies (20). The Open TG-GATEs and DrugMatrix data was used as reference data in a toxicogenomics analysis using RNA-seq with text-mining (21). A carcinogenicity prediction study was conduced using human in vitro data with a connectivity map (22). Recently, a web-based tool that assesses potential liver toxicity using specific gene signatures was also developed (23). It also should be noted that Open TG-GATEs data was utilized as trial data in CAMDA (Critical Assessment of Massive Data Analysis) 2012 (http://camda.bioinfo.cipf.es/ camda2012/) and 2013 (http://dokuwiki.bioinf.jku.at/doku. php).  

A new and prominent feature in this database is the massive amount of digital pathology images. We think the digital pathology images also have the potential to improve toxicity assessments by their use as phenotypic end points. One of the great challenges in this field is to create an automatic pathology annotation system for liver and kidney toxicity. This will greatly improve the efficiency of current pathology diagnosis. Even before this is accomplished, the extraction of further parameters, such as the degree, extent and location of injury, and their associated gene expression profiles and toxicological data, would enable more accurate toxicity predictions.  

There are some important points to consider when analyzing Open TG-GATEs data, several of which are discussed here. The first point is concerned with the gene expression data obtained from in vitro experiments. When a test compound with direct cytotoxicity in hepatocytes is applied to cells, mRNA expression is drastically changed (1). In such cases, even after global normalization, the foldchange values (differential expression between treated and control samples) will not reflect actual fold-changes. Secondly, it is important to note that the concentration of some compounds (in vitro experiments) will not achieve the toxic doses because of limited solubility in the growth medium. In such cases, gene expression will not exhibit significant alterations. A third concern is that of potential variations in methodology. TGP hematology and biochemical parameters were generated over the course of 10 years among different contract research organizations. Thus, the instruments and reagents used to obtain the data are not likely to remain identical over a 10 year period, even within a single organization. Therefore, analyses comparing parameters across the entire database may exhibit certain systematic trends. Consequently, the use of individual experimental sets is recommended for conducting rigorous analyses.  

As mentioned above, the Open TG-GATEs data has already been utilized by third-party groups. At the same time, we have started to receive questions about detailed aspects of the data. Although some of the answers to these inquiries have already been published, they may be dispersed in publications published over the previous 10 years, while other answers remain unpublished. In order to understand the characteristics and structure of the data and avoid misuse, we have attempted to provide here an overview of Open TGGATEs as well as some general guidelines for use of the database.  

# FUTURE DIRECTIONS  

Although toxicogenomics using transcriptomics data is a powerful approach to identify gene set signatures for toxicity, we recognize that a multi-omics approach, such as in combination with metabolomics data, can facilitate the interpretation of gene expression changes due to its complementary role to transcriptomics data (24). We plan to integrate metabolomics data and leverage its complementary relationship in the future. Currently, we are focusing on the efficacy and safety of adjuvants that are components of various vaccines. Similar protocols and methodologies are being applied to obtain gene expression profiles and toxicology data related to adjuvants. These data will be open to the public in a format that can be integrated with Open TGGATEs data to assess the efficacy and safety of adjuvants.

# ABSTRACT  

Open Targets Genetics (https://genetics. opentargets.org) is an open-access integrative resource that aggregates human GWAS and functional genomics data including gene expression, protein abundance, chromatin interaction and conformation data from a wide range of cell types and tissues to make robust connections between GWAS-associated loci, variants and likely causal genes. This enables systematic identification and prioritisation of likely causal variants and genes across all published trait-associated loci. In this paper, we describe the public resources we aggregate, the technology and analyses we use, and the functionality that the portal offers. Open Targets Genetics can be searched by variant, gene or study/phenotype. It offers tools that enable users to prioritise causal variants and genes at disease-associated loci and access systematic cross-disease and disease-molecular trait colocalization analysis across 92 cell types and tissues including the eQTL Catalogue. Data visualizations such as Manhattan-like plots, regional plots, credible sets overlap between studies and PheWAS plots enable users to explore GWAS signals in depth. The integrated data is made available through the web portal, for bulk download and via a GraphQL API, and the software is open source. Applications of this integrated data include identification of novel targets for drug discovery and drug repurposing.  

# INTRODUCTION  

The identification of novel druggable targets for developing safe and effective medicines is a key priority for the pharmaceutical industry. However, drug development is inefficient, with over $90\%$ of the drugs that enter clinical trials failing, often at late stages, with the primary reason being an inability to demonstrate efficacy (1). These failures inflict major resource and time losses where it is estimated that the total R&D cost per new drug is over $\$2.5$ billion (2). They also largely reflect our poor understanding of disease biology and hence it is critical to incorporate new evidence in drug development decisions that could help impact drug success. Drugs with targets that have underlying genetic evidence for disease association have been shown to be twice as likely to succeed in clinical development (3,4). Therefore, systematic evaluation of genetic associations for a particular disease or trait can aid discovery of suitable targets (genes) for drug development. There is now a large and ever-growing number of human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and population biobank studies generating evidence for the role of genetic variants in common or complex disease phenotypes.  

The majority of GWAS-associated variants fall in the non-coding part of the genome suggesting that they affect complex traits and diseases through altering expression of neighbouring genes using regulatory mechanisms. Identifying the causal gene underlying each association signal is an intense process requiring the integration of data from GWAS with transcriptomics, proteomics and epigenomics datasets from a wide range of cell types and tissues. Experimental validation is then used to confirm the likely causal variant(s) and the gene it is regulating. International efforts and consortia have used integrative approaches to identify target genes for specific therapy areas but there are currently no resources that leverage publicly available GWAS and functional genomics data in a scalable and reproducible way to systematically assign causal variants and target genes at all disease-associated loci.  

In the absence of a publicly available portal that helps address these challenges and allows a wide array of biological questions to be answered systematically, we developed Open Targets Genetics (https://genetics.opentargets. org), an open-access integrative resource that enables statistical genetics and functional genomics scientists to translate signals from Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and Biobank data into target gene(s) across thousands of traits genome-wide using a workflow suited to their needs. This portal was constructed based on the latest technology to enable data to be easily added and browsed. It contains genetic and functional genomics data from a wide range of repositories and datasets, as well as additional data analyses generated internally using robust statistical methods. The data integrated into Open Targets Genetics can be searched by gene, variant or trait/disease. It offers several features that are fundamental for refining GWAS signals and identifying the likely causal variant(s) and target gene(s) at trait-associated loci. These include: (i) systematic statistical fine-mapping across thousands of trait-associated loci to resolve association signals, (ii) cross-trait/diseasedisease colocalisation analysis and disease-molecular trait colocalisation analysis across 92 tissues and cell types, (iii) linking each variant to its likely target gene(s), using a single evidence score aggregating across a range of functional genomics datasets (disease agnostic), (iv) prediction of the likely causal gene(s) for all GWAS-associated loci using a machine learning model combining genetics and functional genomics information in a single ‘locus to gene’ (L2G) score, (v) Phenome Wide Association Study (PheWAS) analysis across a wide range of diseases and traits, (vi) enriched trait––gene evidence with orthogonal evidence including clinical trials that might support therapeutic hypothesis by linking with the Open Targets Platform (https: //www.targetvalidation.org/) (5,6).  

This stand-alone genetics resource within the Open Targets ecosystem complements the existing Open Targets Platform and provides underlying genetic evidence to aid drug target identification and prioritisation.  

# Overview of the Open Targets Genetics Portal  

Figure 1 outlines Open Targets Genetics Portal: the publicly-available data sources (A), the processes required to ingest and integrate the datasets together (B), the internal statistical genetics and causal inference data analyses carried out to provide additional information to users (C and D), and the available access options (E).  

# Data resources  

Several sources of GWAS data are integrated into the portal in order to establish the link between variants and traits/diseases (Figure 1A). Firstly, GWAS studies with summary statistics are retrieved from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog summary statistics database ( $N=300$ currently) (7). Due to a lack of suitable reference genotypes for conditional analysis required for non-European populations, full summary statistics are only used for studies that are predominantly of European ancestry. Although most studies to date have been in European populations, we aim to expand the scope of studies in Open Targets Genetics to new populations as soon as large enough reference panels become available. Secondly, two published GWAS analyses utilising UK Biobank data have been integrated: the SAIGE study of 2139 binary (case-control) phenotypes, and the Neale lab study of 1283 quantitative traits (http://www.nealelab.is/uk-biobank) (8). Ingestion of summary statistics includes harmonisation of alleles, genome build liftover, formatting, partitioning and filtering (Figure 1B). Lastly, studies from the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog which do not have summary statistics are also included, adding a further 14 013 studies (7).  

In addition to GWAS, functional genomics data provides evidence for the effect of variants on genes (Figure 1A). Molecular phenotype quantitative trait loci data (QTLs) includes protein QTL (pQTL) data of 2994 plasma proteins assessed in 3301 individuals of European descent (9). Gene expression QTLs (eQTLs) are integrated from the eQTL Catalogue, eQTLGen and GTEx (https://www.gtexportal. org/home/) (10,11). Other datasets that provide evidence for variant to gene (V2G) association include epigenetics chromatin conformation and interaction experiments with promoter capture hiC (PCHI-C) from 27 different cell types, enhancer-TSS pairwise cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) correlation, and DNase I hypersensitive site (DHS)-gene promoter correlation (12–14). Each epigenetic data point is represented as a pair of interacting genomic intervals and an association statistic. Interval pairs are retained with one end encompassing an Ensembl gene Transcription Start Site (TSS) and the other end containing any variant in GnomAD 2.1 (Figure 1B) (15,16).

All traits have been manually mapped to the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) (17). This level of data standardisation provides additional value for users interested in integrating data across studies.  

# Statistical genetics analysis  

In addition to the large resource of genetics and functional genomics datasets, Open Targets Genetics also analyses the available evidence in order to link variants to disease, variants to genes and ultimately genes to disease. This, for example, enables prioritisation of causal genes for a specific disease based on robust genetic and functional genomics information, thus allowing better prioritisation of potential drug targets.  

We use the following data model:  

$$
\begin{array}{r l}&{\mathrm{Study(S)}-\mathrm{LeadVariant(V_{L})}-\mathrm{TagVariant(V_{T})}}\\ &{\qquad-\mathrm{Gene(G)}}\end{array}
$$  

Disease and trait association information (Study) are obtained from the GWAS which links disease status (or other trait measurements) to common genetic variation. A common association significance threshold of $P<5\mathrm{e}{-8}$ is set for all studies. While some studies provide the complete summary statistics, others only report the lead variant $(\mathrm{V_{L}})$ at each associated locus. However, it cannot be assumed that the $\mathrm{v_{L}}$ is causing the association; due to linkage disequilibrium (LD), the $\mathrm{v_{L}}$ might belong to a set of SNPs that have travelled together with the true causal SNP on a haplotype block. For this reason, fine-mapping/credible set analysis and LD expansion are implemented to include all tag variants $(\mathrm{V_{T}})$ and provide a more comprehensive set of potentially causal variants linked to the trait (Figure 1C).  

Given that not all GWAS have summary statistics available, two fine-mapping methods are applied, one using full summary statistics, and another using LD information only. For studies with full summary statistics, we use GCTACOJO to identify independent signals, and then perform per-signal conditional analysis adjusting for other independent signals in a $\pm2$ Mb region from the lead variant (18). For every conditionally independent signal, fine-mapping using the Approximate Bayes Factor approach is performed (19). For GWAS without summary statistics, we use the PICS method with an LD reference from the most closely matched 1000 genomes project superpopulation (20). This enables us to estimate the probability that each variant is causal across 133,441 study-lead variant associated loci. Output from both methods provides a posterior probability (PP) for each variant being causal for a given association. In order to identify complex traits and diseases that share common molecular mechanisms, we also perform crosstrait colocalization analyses for 3,621 GWAS studies with summary statistics.  

To assign likely causal genes for a given variant, we initially developed a disease-agnostic Variant to Gene (V2G) analysis pipeline which provides a single aggregated score for each variant-gene prediction. This analysis combines four different data types; molecular phenotype quantitative trait loci datasets (eQTLs and pQTLs), chromatin interaction and conformation datasets, in silico functional predictions (using the Variant Effect Predictor or VEP score), and distance from the canonical transcript start site (21). The data harmonisation and aggregation process as well as the weighting applied to each of the datasets are described here: https://genetics-docs.opentargets.org/ our-approach/data-pipeline. More recently, we have developed a disease-specific gene prioritisation approach (Locus to Gene score, L2G) to prioritise genes at all trait-associated loci using a machine learning model. For this, we integrate fine-mapping credible set analysis across all 133,441 loci with functional genomics data (including pathogenicity prediction, colocalisation with molecular quantitative trait loci, genomic distance and chromatin interaction data) to generate L2G predictive features. We then train a supervised model using over 400 gold-standard positive GWAS loci for which we are confident of the gene implicated to predict causal genes at each locus (see https://github. com/opentargets/genetics-gold-standards). It is important to note that the existing gold-standard genes are likely to be biased towards those that are near the centre of the GWAS peak and which have clear (nonsynonymous) variant consequences, which will influence the features learned in the L2G model. We intend to continue expanding the repository of gold standard loci to enable building the most accurate model possible for gene prioritisation. More details on the machine learning method are described in available online documentation (https://genetics-docs.opentargets.org/ our-approach/pipeline-overview).  

To summarise, three statistical genetics data analyses are carried out as outlined in Figure 1C. Lead variant annotation, and lead variant to tag variant expansion methods, which include fine-mapping/credible set analysis and linkage-disequilibrium expansion are described in full here: https://genetics-docs.opentargets.org/our-approach/ assigning-traits-to-loci. Disease-molecular trait colocalisation analysis for studies with full summary statistics is explained in more detail here: https://genetics-docs. opentargets.org/our-approach/colocalisation-analysis. Similar analyses have been conducted for GWAS studies without full summary statistics, using an approximate colocalisation heuristic based on variant probabilities from the PICS method. These analyses then feed into the causal inference L2G analysis pipeline to connect the associated loci to genes, utilising underlying evidence in order to ultimately rank the genes most likely to be underlying the associated trait/disease (Figure 1C).  

# A technical look into the Genetics Portal  

Retrieving, processing, analysing and presenting the large amount of biological data in the Genetics Portal introduces some challenges. The majority of the data currently in the Portal corresponds to public information that we downloaded from the respective resources and analysed in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Other datasets such as the UK Biobank LD reference panel have more restrictive access conditions and so were analysed locally. Storing and processing the hundreds of TB of raw data has also required some technical solutions for large scale data manipulation. Other challenges relate to the algorithmic part of the analysis. For example, the full cross-trait and QTL colocalisation currently takes about 4 weeks, conducting 2,035,470 successful comparisons on a compute cluster using 60 CPU cores. Since computing pairwise similarities is an ${\mathrm{O}}(N^{2})$ problem, we are looking into new methods that might alleviate the current constraints. Considering the speed at which population genomics data is currently generated, maintaining a set of reference datasets (e.g. LD panels, variant indexes) also introduces the need for keeping infrastructure up-to-date.  

All data is harmonised, analysed and merged using a combination of programming languages (Python v3, R v3.3, Scala v2.12) and computational libraries and frameworks (e.g. Apache Spark v2.4.5, GCTA v1.93) and stored in Parquet format when possible. The resulting 2TB of inferences are loaded into ClickHouse v20.1.4.14 and ElasticSearch v5.6.16 (Supplemental Figure S1). These two services are configured, loaded and optimised in GCP. More importantly, they are released publicly to users interested in creating their own instances of the Genetics Portal. The API is also available at https://genetics-api.opentargets.io and implemented using GraphQL v2.0.0, Play Framework v2.7.3, Slick framework v3.3.2 and Sangria v2.0.0. The web application is available at https://genetics.opentargets.org and utilises React v16.8 as well as a number of javascript libraries with emphasis on D3.js v5.5 for custom interactive visualisations. The large amount of data also introduces challenges for some user interface components. To build the locus plot (Supplemental Figure S2) for example, we use a canvas element as it is not possible to accomplish the visualisation with regular DOM nodes. To ensure global access, Open Targets Genetics is deployed on GCP across three different regions: in Europe (Belgium zone), United States (South Carolina zone) and Asia (Tokyo zone) (Supplemental Figure S1). Each regional deployment is the same and globally balanced. All code is open source and accessible in the repositories listed in Supplementary Table S1.  

# Navigating the available features within the Open Targets Genetics Portal user interface  

Users can utilise the Genetics Portal to address a range of biological questions (Supplemental Figure S3). Depending on their question, users may start with a search for a gene, variant (genomic position or dbSNP reference sequence ID) or a trait/disease of interest. The data visualisations and tools provided on these pages allow users to navigate and explore the information to help answer their biological questions (Figures 2–5, Supplemental Figures S2 and S4).  

Figure 2 provides an example of the information displayed on the study-trait page. The first section provides an overview of the study sample size and links to the original publication (Figure 2A). The second section provides a Manhattan-like plot that displays the independently associated variants that reached GWAS significance threshold (Figure 2B). A table provides the effect sizes of the alternative allele and the genes likely to be involved at each susceptibility locus prioritised by the statistical genetics analysis pipelines (colocalisation, L2G score, and closest gene) (Figure 2C). Using the ‘compare studies’ button on the study page, users can also compare the Manhattan plot for the root study with Manhattan plots for other studies to identify shared independent loci across the genome (https://genetics-docs.opentargets.org/how-to-use-opentargets-genetics-starting-with/multiple-traits-or-diseases) (Figure 2D).

Abbreviations: IBD; inflammatory bowel disease, ID; identifier, GWAS; Genome-wide association study, LD; linkage disequilibrium, L2G; locus-to-gene, SNP; single nucleotide polymorphism.  

Figure 3 provides an example of the information displayed on the variant page. If a user is interested in the genes that are likely to be functionally implicated by a given variant in a disease-agnostic way, the first section ‘Assigned genes’ displays the results from the Variant to Gene (V2G) pipeline, with a list of genes prioritised by their V2G score and the functional genomics evidence that supports this connection (Figure 3B). If gene expression data supports this connection, it is possible to view the effect of the variant on gene expression together with the directionality of effect and the tissue/cell type in which the effect is observed. If the user is interested in the traits/diseases associated with a given variant, then a PheWAS plot together with the directionality of effect of the alternative allele across different phenotypes is displayed (Figure 3C).  

Figure 4 provides an example of the information displayed on the gene page. Searching for a gene of interest (in this case ITGA4), the user can find links to further information in the Open Targets Platform such as information about drugs in clinical trials that target this gene, animal model phenotype data, pathway data and expression data, along with links to other key resources. In order to identify traits and diseases associated with a given gene, the user can access the output from two statistical genetics analysis pipelines: the L2G analysis (Figure 4B) and the colocalisation (Figure 4C). For the L2G score, the traits prioritised can be ranked by their L2G score varying between 0 and 1, with 1 being the highest confidence trait-gene assignment at a given locus. To identify other causal gene assignments at a given susceptibility locus, the button ‘gene prioritisation’ takes the user to the study-locus page defined by a lead variant and a GWAS study.

Figure 5 provides an example of the information displayed on the study-locus page. In this example, we are investigating an Inflammatory Bowel Disease susceptibility locus defined by 2 181443625 A G where the alternative allele (G) is protective (22). The first section (Figure 5A) displays the genes prioritised at this locus by the L2G analysis pipeline, with a breakdown of the individual predictors to show the score each gene would receive in a model including a single predictor category. The second section displays the genes prioritised at this locus using the colocalisation pipeline as a table (Figure 5B) or as a heatmap (Figure 5C). The third section displays GWAS traits and diseases that colocalise at this locus (Figure 5D). The final section provides the set of likely causal variants (credible sets) at this locus together with a regional plot view and enables the user to look at credible sets overlap between this study and other GWAS and QTL studies that colocalise at this locus (Figure 5E).  

# Programmatic access to the Genetics Portal  

Users can access the Genetics Portal data in different programmatic ways depending on their requirements and preference: downloading data via EMBL-EBI’s FTP download service or Google Cloud Storage service; running systematic analyses on datasets using Google Cloud BigQuery service; and executing specific queries with various GraphQL API endpoints (Figure 1E). Details on data download access is available at https://genetics-docs.opentargets.org/ technical-pipeline/data-download while information on GraphQL API access is available at https://genetics-docs. opentargets.org/technical-pipeline/graphql-api.  

# Users of the Genetics Portal  

The public availability and wide applicability of the genetics-trait association data provided can serve a wide range of users with different expertise. As the portal software is also open source, users can install their own instance and integrate their own data. In addition, the gene prioritisation data using the L2G score from the Open Targets Genetics Portal feeds into the genetic association evidence to support target – disease associations in the Open Targets Platform (5).  

# DISCUSSION  

We have built an integrated system for incorporating GWAS, eQTL, pQTL and epigenetics data resources together and provide statistical genetics analysis of this data within an easy-to-navigate portal, which requires compatibility of data features (for example genes are mapped to

To integrate genetic and functional genomics data from the wide array of disease association studies and functional genomics datasets, a major challenge is the mapping of traits from different data resources to a standardised terminology to allow systematic aggregation of associations linked to the same underlying trait or disease. We have used the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) to map disease terms across data resources and have added new EFO terms where required. This involves extensive manual review for each new data resource added to ensure automatic mappings are correct. Another challenge is the availability and format of data, and the requirement of making human genetic and disease data publicly available within an ethical framework. This limits the resources and types of data we are able to bring into the portal, utilising datasets that have permissions for public dissemination, have been published previously, or providing summary statistics of cohort-level information. Some of the statistical genetic analyses we carry out utilise data sets such as LD matrices that are kept for internal use only, provided to us by the data resource but that contain individual-level data that cannot be shared publicly. Availability of suitable LD matrices for non-European populations is also a limitation preventing application of all analyses across all available data. The data analysis pipelines pose challenges, such

as the length of time it takes to run co-localisation (currently a month) due to the amount of data involved, and which we are improving to gain faster response times. The strength of the Open Targets Genetics Portal is that we overcome these challenges for the benefit of our users.  

In addition to backend improvements which will enable more frequent release cycles, future work focuses on the integration of available data sets for more diverse populations. This includes international biobanks and population studies as they become publicly available, as well as developing LD matrices for non-European populations to allow GWAS catalog and Biobank data for these populations to be analysed. We plan to integrate COVID-19 infection susceptibility genetic study results as these become available, to aid in the drug discovery effort for the global pandemic by providing supporting genetic evidence for key human target genes. We also plan to develop existing features, such as expanding the colocalisation view to be genome-wide.  

In conclusion, with the advent of GWAS, exome and whole genome sequencing and a growing number of national genomics population studies and biobanks, there is now a huge volume of human genetic and functional data linked to disease traits. The challenge is integration and systematic analysis of this data to enable robust statistical associations and prioritisation of genes underlying disease causation. The Open Targets Genetics Portal addresses these challenges and provides the results in a unique open platform which can be queried programmatically or via an informative user interface. This enables users to address a wide range of research questions, and provides underlying evidence to aid drug discovery.

# ABSTRACT  

Similarity of gene expression across a wide range of biological conditions can be efficiently used in characterization of gene function. We have constructed a rice gene coexpression database, RiceFREND (http://ricefrend.dna.affrc.go.jp/), to identify gene modules with similar expression profiles and provide a platform for more accurate prediction of gene functions. Coexpression analysis of 27 201 genes was performed against 815 microarray data derived from expression profiling of various organs and tissues at different developmental stages, mature organs throughout the growth from transplanting until harvesting in the field and plant hormone treatment conditions, using a single microarray platform. The database is provided with two search options, namely, ‘single guide gene search’ and ‘multiple guide gene search’ to efficiently retrieve information on coexpressed genes. A user-friendly web interface facilitates visualization and interpretation of gene coexpression networks in HyperTree, Cytoscape Web and Graphviz formats. In addition, analysis tools for identification of enriched Gene Ontology terms and cis-elements provide clue for better prediction of biological functions associated with the coexpressed genes. These features allow users to clarify gene functions and gene regulatory networks that could lead to a more thorough understanding of many complex agronomic traits.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) has been at the forefront of plant genomics since the completion of the genome sequence of the japonica cultivar Nipponbare. The high-quality map-based sequence and complete annotation of every transcriptional unit in the genome have facilitated remarkable advancements in molecular genetics of rice as well as in many applied aspects of cereal genomics (1–4). Subsequently, elucidating the function of all predicted genes has become an ultimate goal not only for complete understanding of the biology of rice but also in developing novel strategies for crop improvement. Due to worldwide efforts in functional genomics, a wide range of resources for characterizing the function of rice genes have been developed and made available to the scientific community (5–9). However, despite these extensive efforts, more than half of about 32 000 genes that define the rice plant, many of which could be possibly involved in the expression of agronomically important traits, still remains to be fully characterized.  

Gene clustering analysis, which is based on the premise that clusters of genes with similar expression patterns across several experimental conditions tend to be functionally related (10), has become a powerful tool for gene function prediction. With the rapid accumulation of microarray data in public repositories, such as NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (11,12), European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI)’s Array Express (13) and DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ)’s CIBEX (14), there is also a proliferation of databases on gene expression profiling of various crops in the public domain (15–19). Similarly, an increasing number of gene coexpression databases in various plant species such as  

Arabidopsis and rice have also been developed (20–26). Coexpression approaches have been widely used in Arabidopsis, particularly in analysis of various biological targets such as transcription factors, enzymes in specific metabolic pathways and protein subunits (27). In rice, gene coexpression data are provided by the RiceArrayNet (25), OryzaExpress (26), ATTED-II (28) and Rice Oligonucleotide Array Database (19). RiceArrayNet was developed based on the Rice $60\mathrm{k}$ Microarray data, and the rest were constructed using rice Affymetrix microarray data.  

In the last 5 years, we have collected ${>}800$ microarray data from organs and tissues of rice plants at various developmental stages, mature organs throughout the entire growth in the field, cell/tissue types isolated by laser microdissection and rice plants subjected to plant hormone treatment (29,30). These expression profiles generated from the model rice cultivar Nipponbare using a single microarray system (Agilent) are available in our gene expression profile database, RiceXPro (17). Most of the data were collected from rice plants grown in the natural environment, which is much more complex than controlled laboratory conditions. This large-scale field transcriptome profiling can be used as a measure of the corresponding changes in physiological and morphological states of the plant triggered by internal or external stimuli under natural conditions. Therefore, our comprehensive collection of gene expression profiles provides a more accurate landscape of the transcriptome that could be used for understanding the function of genes based on the level, time specificity and position specificity of expression, as well as the overall similarity of gene expression of various organs and tissues in the natural field environment.  

Here, we describe the Rice Functionally Related gene Expression Network Database (RiceFREND), a database for retrieving gene coexpression information across a wide range of gene expression profiles which we collected using a single microarray platform.  

# DATABASE COMPONENTS AND FEATURES  

The overall concept of RiceFREND is to provide a platform for efficient prediction of gene functions and gene regulatory networks based on gene expression similarity. A schematic diagram of the major components and various features of the database such as search options, coexpression network viewers, analysis tools and detailed information on coexpressed genes is shown in Supplementary Figure S1.  

# Calculation for coexpression analysis  

All gene expression data described in this database were obtained from microarray analysis using the rice $4{\times}44\mathrm{K}$ microarray RAP-DB platform (Agilent Technologies, G2519F#15241), which contains 35 760 independent probes corresponding to 27 201 annotated loci published in the Rice Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB) (4). A total of 24 data sets corresponding to 815 microarray data from various organs and tissues at different developmental stages and treatment with plant hormones, including redundant data among the data sets, were used as data source for coexpression analysis (Supplementary Table S1). All data have been deposited in GEO (11,12) and accessible through GEO series accession numbers: GSE21396, GSE21397, GSE36040, GSE36042, GSE36 043, GSE36044, GSE39423, GSE39424, GSE39425, GSE39426, GSE39427, GSE39429 and GSE39432.  

The expression data were obtained either by intensity-based one-color or ratio-based two-color microarray hybridization system. In the 75th percentile normalization for one-color method, the processed raw signal intensities of 35 760 probes were divided by 75th percentile value and transformed to log2 scale. The median expression value within each data set was further subtracted to obtain the relative value for each probe. Mean values were used for redundant probes assigned to the same locus. For data obtained using the two-color microarray system, the expression profile for each gene corresponds to the log2 ratio of cyanine 5 (Cy5) signal intensity for treatment to cyanine 3 (Cy3) signal intensity for mock treatment (log2 Cy5/Cy3). All data sets were combined into one gene expression matrix data for coexpression analysis among genes. The weighted Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated to reduce any unsuitable effects that may have resulted from sample redundancies. The mutual rank (MR) was used as an index for coexpression as described in ATTED-II (21,31).  

# Annotation of genes  

The RAP2 representative data in general feature format derived from RAP-DB (4) were basically used as annotation of each gene. The corresponding Michigan State University Osa1 Rice Locus (MSU ID) (32) for each RAP locus ID was obtained using the ID converter tool in RAP-DB. Generic Gene Ontology (GO) annotations in RAP-DB were converted to GO slim using the map2slim.pl script (http://search.cpan.org/ $\sim$ cmungall/goperl/). A total of 1308 genes commonly described in PlnTFDB (33) and PlantTFDB (34) were classified as transcription factors. The subcellular localization sites of proteins were predicted by WoLF PSORT (35) based on the deduced amino acid sequences of each gene. The gene symbols/names of 1523 genes and functional categories of 2053 genes were obtained from Oryzabase (36) and KEGG Pathway Database (37), respectively.  

# Coexpression search with a single guide gene  

The coexpression search is based on the ‘guide gene’ approach in which a pre-selected gene or set of genes is used to retrieve coexpressed genes. In the single guide gene search option, coexpression search is initiated by entering a keyword such as RAP locus ID, gene name, MSU ID and other identifiers or by selecting specific chromosome in the panel representing the 12 rice chromosomes. This provides a tabular list of coexpressed genes with information on RAP locus ID, gene description, transcription factor, gene symbol and the corresponding MSU ID. The RAP locus ID opens a pop-up window with direct links to RiceXPro (17) for gene expression profile used in coexpression analysis, RAP-DB (4) for detailed annotations and SALAD database (38) for genome-wide comparative analysis of motifs. The MSU ID provides direct link to the annotation of the gene as described in the MSU Rice Genome Annotation Project database (32). The coexpression data for each gene are shown in two formats, a tabular list of coexpressed genes in ascending order of MR (Figure 1A) and a graphical representation of the coexpression network in HyperTree (http://philogb .github.com/jit/) format (Figure 1B). The MR list also contains information on predicted subcellular localization sites of proteins, KEGG pathways and transcription factors. Coexpressed genes can be selected and used for further analysis, such as GO enrichment test and ciselement analysis as described below. A filter option allows users to retrieve information for gene/genes of interest using RAP locus ID, description, MSU ID, transcription factor and gene symbol/name as keywords.  

The HyperTree graphical viewer shows the relationships of coexpressed genes based on a user-defined hierarchy and MR value or rank based on ascending MR value. In this viewer, the nodes representing the coexpressed genes with MR value below a defined threshold are joined to form edges (Figure 1B and C). The coexpression data can be viewed for a maximum of 100 coexpressed genes and the network size can be set by selecting the MR value and hierarchy. Detailed information on the nodes comprising a network is provided from the ‘Node List’ and via a pop-up window on each node in the HyperTree. The nodes are labeled with RAP locus ID but options for other identifiers such as gene symbol, gene name, transcription factor, MSU ID and KEGG pathway are available. The node for a transcription factor is indicated by a red square and the node with a KEGG pathway annotation is indicated by a tag corresponding to a specific pathway. All genes with KEGG pathway annotation are listed in a table with direct links to the database. In addition to HyperTree, the gene network can also be viewed in Cytoscape Web (39) and Graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org/) formats, thereby providing several options to visually understand the relationship among coexpressed genes. Download options are available for the node list, data for construction of network in Cytoscape (40) and the graph images in Cytoscape Web and Graphviz formats.  

The coexpressed gene network generated using MADS14 (Os03g0752800), which encode APETALA1/ FRUITFUL-like MADS domain protein, as a guide gene is shown in Figure 1B and C. MADS14 is coexpressed with other MADS-box genes, namely, MADS15 (Os07g0108900), MADS18 (Os07g0605200) and MADS34 (Os03g0753100). It has been reported recently that the four MADS-box genes were coordinately expressed in the shoot apical meristem to specify the identity of the inflorescence meristem during reproductive phase transition (41). Therefore, the gene network would reflect overlapping functions of the four MADS-box genes and provided useful clue that could be used to further elucidate the molecular mechanism of reproductive transition in rice.  

# Coexpression search with multiple guide genes  

The multiple guide gene search uses two or more pre-selected genes as guide genes to expand the coverage of gene coexpression networks. This search is also initiated by entering a keyword such as RAP locus ID, gene name, MSU ID or other identifiers. From the tabular list generated by the search, two or more guide genes are selected, and the hierarchy and MR value or rank to be used for construction of gene network are defined. Information useful for selection of threshold in MR value among query genes can be viewed in the matrix data (Figure 2A). The coexpression network is generated in either a Cytoscape Web format with several options for node label and network layout (Figure 2B) or Graphviz format, both of which provide detailed annotation of nodes, direct links to other databases and the HyperTree and MR List from the single guide gene search against each node in the network. Additionally, the coexpression network can be reconfigured by selecting other guide genes from the node list panel. As in the single guide gene search, download options are also available for note list, data for construction of Cytoscape and the graph images in Cytoscape Web and Graphviz formats.  

The gene network generated by the multiple guide gene search ( $\mathrm{MR}<7$ , hierarchy $=2$ ) with ent-kaurene synthase gene $\mathrm{Os04g0611800}$ (OsKS1) and six kaurene synthase-like genes, namely, Os04g0179700 (OsKSL4), Os02g0571300 (OsKSL5), $\mathrm{Os02g0571800}$ (OsKSL6), Os02g0570400 (OsKSL7), Os11g0474800 (OsKSL8) and Os12g0491800 (OsKSL10) as guide genes is shown in Figure 2B. OsKS1 is associated with gibberellin biosynthesis (42), whereas OsKSL4, OsKSL8, OsKSL10 and OsKSL7 are related to biosynthesis of diterpenoid phytoalexin such as momilactones A and B, oryzalexins S, oryzalexins A–F and phytocassanes A–E, respectively (43–45). This multiple guide gene search generated a gene network comprising four clusters. The largest cluster contains OsKSL4, OsKSL7, OsKSL8 and OsKSL10 which have been reported to be induced by UV irradiation and elicitor treatment (42–45). On the other hand, OsKS1, and OsKSL5 and OsKSL6, the expression of which is not affected by such treatment (46), were included in a separate cluster. Interestingly, momilactone biosynthetic genes (47), namely, CPS4, KSL4, MAS, CYP99A2 and CYP99A3 are strongly connected to each other (Figure 2C), and several phytocassane biosynthetic genes (48) are also included in the largest cluster. This coexpression analysis suggests that the resulting gene network can be used to define the biological function of each kaurene synthase genes and may therefore help in exploring novel enzymes related to phytoalexine biosynthesis based on the coexpression signature.  

# Analysis tools  

In order to enhance prediction of biological functions associated with the coexpressed gene network, Rice FREND is provided with analysis tools for identification of enriched GO terms and cis-elements. The GO enrichment test facilitates the identification of overrepresented GO terms among coexpressed genes for better understanding of the functional relationships of these genes. The Fisher’s exact test is applied against GO terms categorized into biological process and molecular function. This

Figure 1. Single guide gene search results interfaces. (A) Tabular list of coexpressed genes generated from the search with Os03g0752800 (MADS14) as guide gene. The coexpressed genes are arranged in the order of decreasing MR value. (B) Graphical view of the coexpressed gene network in HyperTree format. Two nodes representing coexpressed genes with MR value below a defined threshold are joined to form an edge. The gene network (MR $^{<7}$ , hierarchy $=3$ ) shown here contains 87 nodes and 114 edges. (C) An enlarged view of the coexpression network using gene symbol as label for nodes. MADS14 is strongly coexpressed with MADS15, MADS18 and MADS34.  

generates a tabular list of overrepresented GO terms in ascending order of $P$ -value which is adjusted by the Benjamini and Hochberg’s method (49) for multiple testing collection (Figure 3A). The result can also be viewed in graph format with a filter option (Figure 3B) that can be used to construct a graph against GO terms with case-positive value ${>}5$ .  

Identification of cis-elements among coexpressed genes could provide additional information for prediction of function. The cis-element analysis tool can be used to clarify whether a specific motif is overrepresented in the 1-kb upstream regions of coexpressed genes based on three statistical tests, namely, $\chi^{2}$ test, Fisher’s exact test and $G$ -test.

Figure 2. Multiple guide gene search results interfaces. (A) Matrix data of MR values among multiple guide genes. Two or more guide genes can be selected to initiate coexpression search. (B) Graphical view of the coexpressed gene network in Cytoscape Web format. The guide genes are shown as large circles with yellow outline. (C) An enlarged view of the coexpression network using gene symbol as label for nodes. Genes involved in momilactone biosynthesis such as CPS4, KS4, MAS, CYP99A2 and CYP99A3 are strongly coexpressed.  

We applied the GO enrichment test and cis-element analysis on the top 100 genes coexpressed with LEA3-1 gene $\mathrm{(Os05g0542500)}$ . It has been reported that over-expression of LEA3-1 improves drought resistance under the natural field conditions (50). Consistent with this observation, the GO terms such as ‘response to water’, ‘response to stress’ and ‘response to abiotic stimulus’ were found to be overrepresented among the coexpressed genes (Figure 3A and B). The expression of LEA3-1 gene is induced not only by drought stress but also by treatment with abscisic acid (ABA). In the ciselement analysis, ABA-responsive element core (ACGT) containing CGMCACGTGB motif (51) is also statistically enriched in the promoter region of the coexpressed genes. Therefore, although the microarray data used for coexpression analysis do not include abiotic stress treatments such as drought and salinity, the results of coexpression search and additional analysis can be used to understand functional relationships among stressinducible genes based on the coexpression.  

# FUTURE DIRECTIONS  

Coexpression analysis can be used more accurately with a more balanced distribution of expression data from various organs and tissues and a wider coverage in terms of experimental conditions. We are currently undertaking microarray analysis involving various organs and tissues at different developmental stages and rice plants subjected to biotic and abiotic stresses. These data will be added to the database and the annotation information will also be updated to further enhance the functionalities and to provide a more reliable platform for retrieving gene expression networks in rice.

# Abstract  

The P oteome-Wide Association Study PWAS) s a protein-based genetic association approach designed o complement raditional variant-based methods ike GWAS PWAS operates n wo stages: first, machine earning models predict he mpact of genetic variants on protein-coding genes, generating effect scores. These scores are then aggregated into a gene-damaging score for each individual. This score is then used in casecontrol statistical tests to significantly link to specific phenotypes. PWAS Hub (v1.2) is a user-friendly platform that facilitates the exploration of gene-disease associations using clinical and genetic data from the UK Biobank (UKB), encompassing $500\mathrm{k}$ individuals. PWAS Hub reports on 819 diseases and phenotypes determined by PheCode and ICD-10 clinical codes, each with a minimum of 400 affected individuals. PWASderived gene associations were reported for $72\%$ of the tested phenotypes. The PWAS Hub also analyzes gene associations separately for males and females, considering sex-specific genetic effects, inheritance patterns (dominant and recessive), and gene pleiotropy. We illustrated the utility of he PWAS Hub or primary essential) hypertension I10), ype 2 diabetes mellitus E11), and specified haematuria R31) hat showed sex-dependent genetic signals. The PWAS Hub, available at pwas.huji.ac.il  is a valuable resource for studying genetic contributions to common diseases and sex-specific effects.

# Introduction  

Public databases have aggregated thousands of reports from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (1 . Most reported associations (e.g. GWAS Catalog) are located in introns or are within intergenic regions that are often distant from coding or non-coding genes (2 . The main challenge in traditional GWAS is the need to accurately map genetic variants to their corresponding credible genes (3 . In reality, mapping relies on assigning associated variants to the nearest gene. Even with the contribution of colocalization methods (4 , variantto-gene associations remain ambiguous (5 . Although variants in these regions may affect chromatin structure and gene expression regulation, the scarcity of functional annotations, which are often cell- or tissue-specific, imits the ability to derive meaningful nsights nto disease etiology 6 . Thus, despite the large number of associated variants, most GWAS have not significantly advanced our understanding of disease etiology (7 8 .  

There are several challenges in interpreting disease mechanisms from GWAS data (9 . A large proportion of GWASassociated variants are located in non-coding regions, which often lack functional annotations. Even when variants are near genes, mapping them to a specific gene remains uncertain and prone to mistakes. Furthermore, causal variants might be masked by neighboring variants that are in linkage disequilibrium (1 . To address these limitations in contemporary genetic research, we developed Proteome Wide Association Study (PWAS), a method designed to perform genetic association studies at the gene level (10 . PWAS aims to identify causal associations specifically within protein-coding genes, using a scoring system based on machine learning and probabilistic modeling to assess the functional impact of genetic variants (11 . Specifically, PWAS provides an aggregated gene effect score from the variant-based FIRM score (11 . The development of PWAS relied on the genotyping data from the UK Biobank (UKB) (12 , incorporating all tagged and imputed single nucleotide variants (SNVs) within the coding regions. The fundamental premise of PWAS is that aggregating the subtle effects of multiple variants enables the detection of genetic signals at the gene level. By calculating a gene-damage probability score for each individual, PWAS dentifies robust and reliable associations hrough standard statistical case-control settings. Specifically, logistic regression models are utilized for the diagnosed binary phenotypes (e.g. schizophrenia, type 2 diabetes). Additionally, PWAS accommodates nonlinear genetic effects by considering dominant and recessive inheritance models for each associated gene (10 . PWAS complements classical GWAS and other gene-centric approaches such as TWAS (13  and segmental aggregation methods (e.g. SKAT-O (14 ) by offering interpretable results through a focus on functionally relevant associations.  

Additionally, he influence of genetics on common diseases, human physiology, and the underlying mechanisms in relation to stratification by sex remains ragmented 15 16 . Currently, sex-dependent genetics in humans are mostly associated with sex chromosomes and largely focus on physical (e.g. height), hormonal, and behavioral traits (17 .  

Herein, we present PWAS Hub (v1.2) that leverages PWAS results across a wide range of complex diseases and conditions represented in the European-origin population of the UK Biobank (UKB). We included hundreds of major diseases and phenotypes (e.g. asthma, obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes). PWAS Hub encompasses the human coding genome, covering over $18\mathrm{k}$ protein-coding genes, each gene is analyzed in case-control settings for male, female, and the combined cohort. PWAS Hub features a user-friendly database and visualization platform that allows users to browse genes and medical outcomes. PWAS Hub (v1.2) enables interactive navigation in many phenotypes. It offers cross-references to major resources in genomics, proteomics, and clinical information. The platform provides he results or all associated genes in a chosen phenotype, the pleiotropic nature of genes, and the results according to gene-centric alternative inheritance models.  

# Materials and methods  

# Data Source  

The input data was extracted from the UK Biobank (UKB). It is a large observational database that encompasses medical, genotyping, and lifestyle information for approximately 500,000 individuals. The individuals (aged 40 to 69) were recruited between 2006–2010 across the United Kingdom. We focused on individuals of European origin (identified through data field codes 1, 1001, 1002, 1003 and information on ethnic background via data field 21000). We took genetic ancestry into account (identified as a genetic ethnic group, data field 22006) and randomly selected one representative from each kinship group, excluding other genetic relatives. This approach avoids an overrepresentation of family members who are likely to share significant genetic overlap.  

In PWAS Hub, we considered diseases and conditions diagnosed according to the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision ICD-10) codes. We considered he UKB data fields 41202 and 41204, and he summary diagnosis code 41270. The filtered cohort has approximately 275,000 individuals of European origin. PWAS Hub covers all diseases hat have a minimal size of ${\sim}200$ cases per tested group. Each cohort carrying a disease phenotype was divided into three subgroups; males, emales, and both. n specific cases, he phenotype is associated with only males or females. For example, the ICD-10 C50 (malignant neoplasm of the breast) reported on 10,682 affected females, but only 77 affected males. That number is below the threshold for analysis.  

Additional phenotypes are represented according to the PheWAS Phenome-Wide Association Studies) coding scheme, a standardized system designed o group related medical diagnoses from ICD (18 . PheCodes often provide broader phenotypic categories by unifying several related CD-10 codes 19 . Altogether, approximately 1,800 PheCodes are used to represent major phenotypes, each of there link to either a single or multiple ICD-10 codes. Some redundancy may occur in using both the PheWAS and ICD-10 codes. For example, he similar (but not identical) cases for type 2 diabetes encoded by PheCode 250.22 (18,523 affected individuals), are also reported as ICD-10 E11 (17,899 affected individuals). n other circumstances, the same cohort is represented by both vocabularies, leading to the redundancy we mention. An example for this is the chronic ischaemic heart disease, identified as ICD-10 I25 and also as PheCode 411.8.  

# Variant inference by FIRM  

The PWAS methodology assumes that variants in coding regions affect phenotypes by altering the biochemical function of the encoded protein of a gene. The pre-trained machine learning (ML) model, called FIRM estimates the extent of the damage caused o each coding gene across he entire proteome (11 . The model was trained to classify pathogenic/ ikely pathogenic variant configurations from ClinVar (20 . Each variant was assigned with a functional effect score ranging between 0 and 1. Such scores capture the propensity of a variant to damage the gene’s protein product according to FIRM, where 0.0 reflects a complete loss of function and 1.0 represents a protein with no effect on its known function. Note that the calculated effect score is agnostic to the phenotype, as the score reflects the impact on the function by the protein’s biochemical damage.  

PWAS reports its results on ${\sim}18{,}050$ coding genes. The current list of complete human proteome was extracted from UniProtKB (21 . Notably, about 2,000 coding genes failed the gene-to-protein mapping and were not included in the current PWAS analysis. Among these unmapped genes are endogenous retrovirus (e.g. ERVK), antibody-related genes and ambiguous mappings of RefSeq genes to their encoded proteins in UniProtKB. The unmapped gene list is available at http://pwas.huji.ac.il/api/file/uniprot.not_mapped.tsv.gz  

# Effect size of genes by heritability modes  

Per-variant damage predictions are aggregated at the gene level for all listed variants. A protein-functional-effect-score is reported for dominant or recessive inheritance models. The dominant inheritance model requires a single allele to be affected, while for recessive inheritance both alleles should be mutated to affect gene functionality. PWAS also provides a combined model or he protein-phenotype association coined the hybrid’ model. To find gene associations, PWAS ests or a correlation between the functional alterations and the phenotype of interest using standard case-control statistical methods. To determine the size of the effect of a gene in PWAS, we applied a Cohen’s $d$ value (standardized mean difference, SMD) which s a normalized difference n he mean gene effect score between cases and controls, divided by the standard error. This calculation was independently applied to dominant and recessive effect scores. For further details on the ensemble of coding variants at a gene level see (10 . In PWAS, higher effect scores represent less functional damage, thereby indicating a ‘protective’ virtue of the gene.  

PWAS calculation included 172 covariates, where multiple levels were transformed into dummy variables of binary type: 1 for sex (binary), year of birth (numeric), 40 principal components that capture the ancestry stratification (numeric), the 105 UKB genotyping batch categories (binary dummies), and 25 UKB assessment center codes associated with each sample (binary dummies). An evaluation of the contribution of covariate types to the GWAS results from the UKB is available in (22 .  

# Coding-GWAS analysis  

While the PWAS effect scores use a gene-aggregation approach, we also performed a routine GWAS variant independent approach under a similar case-control design, while restricting the variants to coding-regions (coined ’coding GWAS’, cGWAS). A total of 639,323 variants (out of the 97,013,422 imputed variants) were included for analysis across the 18,053 protein-coding genes. Note that the set of variants used by PWAS and cGWAS is identical (23 . On average, here are 35.4 nonsense and missense mutations per coding gene.  

The cGWAS associations were derived from PLINK 2.0 default logistic regression (23 . The calculated $z$ score specifies the effect size and directionality of the effect per variant. For GWAS, a positive $z$ score indicates a risk variant due to the positive correlation between the disease and the number of alternative alleles. To secure the unbiased comparisons, we also included the 172 covariates from PWASin our in-house cGWAS.  

# A gene-centric population partition  

We tested the genetic signal of a disease in the entire population per each gene. Specifically, he phenotype prevalence was calculated based on the $95\%$ confidence interval using Wilson’s score for binomial proportions. We examined the distribution of PWAS effect scores by considering all possible cutoffs (indicated by $\%$ of the cohort). For each gene-disease association study, we report the threshold that gave the best partition relative o he gene among ndividuals presenting he disease of interest. For example, a threshold marked ‘bottom $10\%$ ’ applies to effect-score values where the chosen threshold s $10\%$ of he cohort with he owest scores i.e. he cohort decile with the most damaged gene). This best-cut analysis is performed in the three subgroups females, males, and both sexes. Further, each gene-disease association was tested under recessive or dominant inheritance models. For the implementation of the gene-centric partition visualization see (24 ).

# Results  

# Summary of gene-based associations in complex diseases  

The PWAS Hub (version 1.2) presents an in-depth statistical analysis of gene associations according to the PWAS method. The original version (v1.0) included approximately 90 most prevalent diseases and phenotypes 25 . PWAS Hub utilizes an updated version of the UKB data from 2023. PWAS Hub covers phenotypes with at least 400 cases, yielding 819 diseases and phenotypes (Supplementary Table S1 . Among them, 206 have $>5,000$ affected individuals (cases). In this report, for simplicity and to avoid poor statistics due to limited cohort sizes, we focus on high-prevalence diseases and phenotypes of about 10,000 affected individuals (130 phenotypes). Among all 819 listed phenotypes (Supplementary Table S1 $72\%$ are associated with at least one PWAS-associated gene. Note that phenotypes with ewer han 200 ndividuals almost always ail to complete the PWAS protocol (see Methods).  

Table 1 ists a sample of high prevalence $(>4\%)$ phenotypes partitioned into males (M), females (F), and both sexes (B), along with the number of PWAS-associated significant genes. Note that for some phenotypes, he prevalence between males and females differs substantially (Table 1  ratio F:M). For example, while hypothyroidism (ICD-10 I10) shows a 3.65- fold higher occurrence in females versus males, for chronic ischemic heart disease (ICD-10 I25), this ratio is 0.33. A detailed list of disease and phenotypes by sex is available in Supplementary Table S1  We observed that for most diseases, the number of PWAS-significant genes without the sex partition i.e. both) s arger relative o he genes discovered according o he sex groups. For example, we dentified 30 significant genes or CD-10 E11 type 2 diabetes mellitus) but only 3 and 12 for the female and male groups, respectively. In contrast, ICD-10 I25 (chronic ischemic heart disease) with 15 PWASassociated genes for the entire cohort, reports on 19 genes for males and none for females.  

An extended able can be viewed on he PWAS Hub portal’s ‘Summary’ page. Note some ICD-10 diagnoses are included with higher resolution. For example, CD10 E78 (disorders of lipoprotein metabolism and other ipidaemias) and a subset of E780 represent ICD10 E78.0 of pure hypercholesterolaemia. The slight difference in the individuals resulted in PWAS gene associations of 19 and 11 genes, respectively. The summary view highlights the genetic effects that resulted in different numbers of PWAS-associated genes or emales and males. The full table can be found at http://pwas.huji.ac.il/service and in Supplementary Table S1  

# Layout of PWAS Hub  

We ntroduce hree main questions hat he user may choose o address using he PWAS Hub: i) ocusing on a gene, what conditions s t associated with? ii) ocusing on a phenotype, what are the genes that promote or lower its risk? and (iii) given a phenotype, what would be the genetic differences across sexes and consequently their sex-oriented risk factors? To address hese questions, we provide an entry point o PWAS Hub through a ‘Welcome’ page that summarizes the actions that can be performed. The user is presented with multiple actions in the form of a ‘What can I do here?’ panel (Figure 1  top left). The panel provides a brief overview of the portal utility. The user can select a gene of interest as a starting point (Figure 1A) or by focusing on any of the diseases and phenotypes listed n he Summary page Figure 1A). Alternatively, he user may seek associations with any of the genes or diseases and gain nsights oward causality and disease mechanisms Figure 1A). n this case, he user can focus on the sex-dependency genetic effects.  

# Search engine and browsing options  

Figure 1 provides different visualizations of the main operational workflow for the PWAS Hub. A search for the genes of interest (Figure 1B) is supported by typing any 3-letters and an auto-complete function; a list of results is shown according to the selected identifier (ID) source. Users can search using UniProtKB, RefSeq or free text for gene names and chromosomal locations. A phenotype widget (Figure 1B, top) lists the top-60 ranked phenotypes in association with the selected gene. Clicking on a colored square of this widget navigates away to the phenotype table for inspecting the pleiotropy nature of he gene of nterest Figure 1B, bottom). Users can benefit from rich collection of cross references, including GTEx, gnomAD, HGNC, GeneCards, and others. For a full list of these external resources, see http://pwas.huji.ac.il/Crossref. n addition, he cross reference panel Figure 1B) ndicates he genomic position of he gene relative o other genes n ts vicinity. The genetic track gives information on a few genes, allowing the user to switch to neighboring genes.  

For each coding gene and each ndividual), he FIRM score was calculated 11 and aggregated o yield a gene effect score. A gene structure along with the variants that were used to calculate the gene effect score is shown (Figure 1B). Note that this gene view is phenotype-agnostic and all variants along the gene length are numbers by their order. Hovering over the variant’s properties, as detailed in the dbSNP database. The exon organization and Pfam/ nterPro domains are indicated for each coding gene.  

The phenotype able Figure 1C) ists he statistics of he significance of the associations for each of the phenotypes that are included in PWAS Hub. The search of a phenotype can be done by browsing the PWAS Hub database using the ‘Phenotypes A to $Z'$ search page (Figure 1C). The layout of the resulting search or a section of he phenotype ist with he etter D is shown (the terms that start with $\mathbf{\nabla}^{\mathcal{\epsilon}}\mathbf{D}^{\mathbf{\eta},}$ are in bold). The visualization of ‘Phenotype A to $Z^{\prime}$ search presents an overview view of all PWAS gene associations, where for each phenotype, the number of significant genes is reported by colored symbols (acronym F for statistics of $\mathrm{FDR}<0.05,$ ). Symbols report results by considering nheritance models acronyms D, R, and H for dominant, recessive, and hybrid inherent modes, respectively). Here, we showcase the ICD-10: I10.  

Figure 1D shows the main results of PWAS associations. In this example, the ICD-10 I10 was the showcase, with gene SH2B3 ranked at he op of he of he ist. By default, genes are sorted by he q-values in he hybrid model) and colored by he effect size as a gradient with blue and red colors ndicating reduced and ncreased risk, respectively. This color scheme s stable across different pages of the PWAS Hub. There are several ways to reach from the gene search page to the ‘Phenotypegene association’ page. t s done hrough browsing he desired phenotype (Figure 1C) or through the gene-centric phenotype table (Figure 1B, bottom) or directly from the Summary page. In the illustrated example, the results applied for both sexes. Notably, group selection (for females, males, or both) adheres to the user selection, and it is carried over to all pages. At any time, he user may switch to a different sex-based grouping by using the sex icon button.  

# Navigating the PWAS Hub for type 2 diabetes showcase  

The significant gene list for type 2 diabetes mellitus (ICD-10 E11, coined T2D) is a collection of 30 genes (Table 1 . Figure 2 shows the head of the top genes identified as significant in PWAS Hub. We also report gene candidates with a relaxed threshold (q-value $<0.1$ ; total 41 genes).

To support easy navigation between pages and within pages and to better understand the results, PWAS Hub includes a detailed tutorial, examples, and numerous ‘help’ icons. Main pages (Gene page, Summary page, Phenotype page, Phenotype-Gene page) also include a Table of Contents to navigate vertically within the page (Figure 1C, marked 1a to 1d), and a breadcrumb trail at the top of each page, for locating the current web page and as a navigational aid. For additional support and to enhance the utility of the portal, we refer the user to ‘help and examples’.

# Gene-phenotype associations with sex groups  

The portal highlights the centrality of sex-dependent genetics by choosing the desired cohort of females, males, or both for each phenotype. Note that for a few of the phenotypes, PWAS Hub provides results for a single sex. For example, the ICD-10 N40 (Hyperplasia of Prostate) is only relevant for the male group. At any stage, he user can compare the sex-based results by switching between the selected cohorts (green icons for male and female). This button appears at the top part of any page hat offers sex-based analysis. Partition of he results for each phenotype by sex i.e. both, males, emales) s isted n Supplementary Table S1 and provided n he Summary’ page). We reported on 1,136 phenotypes in which PWAS analysis was completed for at least one of the sex groups.  

A ‘Sex-compared’ page presents a precomputed comparison of gene phenotype associations by sex (Figure 3 . To illustrate such a novel view, we compared the genes identified in females and in males for ICD-10 R31 (unspecified haematuria). The prevalence of R31 is $5.3\%$ , and the occurrence in males relative to females is 1.7 times higher (F:M ratio 0.59, Table 1 . Unspecified haematuria is indicated by the presence of blood in urine for unknown reasons. This may reflect additional conditions such as kidney injury or a general kidney disease, including cancer. Additional suspected causes include

kidney stones and inflammation of infection, for which the genetic basis is unknown and likely to be associated with a complex etiology.  

PWAS Hub can be tested with a focus on differential sex genetic signals by applying the association method to females, males and both. Figure 3 shows the top gene association results by sex stratifications for the phenotype ICD-10 R31. There are 37 PWAS-associated significant genes. To demonstrate this, we present the top 7 genes in females, males, and both. The majority of the genes (6 of 7) for the entire cohort (both) are colored n blue and hus specify risk-reducing genes. This trend is captured also in the male subgroup. However, n the female subgroup (Figure 3 , most genes (5 of 7) are colored red and thus associated with elevated risk for ICD-10 R31. We concluded that the etiology of ICD-10 R31 (unspecified haematuria) s not dentical when confronting male versus female.  

Figure 4A gives the legend and the breadcrumb widget that indicate a ’Sex-comparison’ analysis of ICD-10 R31 for the current page. The legend shows the summary statistics for the significant associated genes in each subgroup. The Venn diagram (Figure 4B) shows that seven genes are shared by all three groups and five genes are uniquely associated with female genetic signals, while no exclusive male-specific genes were observed. The results of the Venn diagram and the list of genes in each of its subsections are accessible for downloading. However, he interpretation of the biological function for the identified genes in this diagram is beyond the scope of this resource. Figure 4C is a graphical estimation of the likelihood for identifying overlapping genes with respect to the size of the PWAS discovery gene sets. The color scale from yellow to red is based on the estimated $-\mathrm{log}_{10}$ p-value) for any combination of the analyzed groups, as marked in green dots below the visual.  

An additional feature on the ‘Sex-comparison’ page is inspired by the genomic visualizations that represent GWAS results, albeit or genes rather han variants. We llustrate he results for unspecified haematuria (ICD-10 R31) to emphasize the differential genetic signal associated with he male vis- $\grave{\mathbf{a}}$ -vis the female groups. The analysis was performed on the variant set used by PWAS Hub $640\mathrm{k}$ coding variants, see Methods). The coding GWAS (cGWAS) analysis allows us to focus on statistically significant gene candidates according to variants located within he coding region of genes. Genes are displayed by their genetic effects for males and females along the chromosomes using an interactive two-way Manhattan plot (Figure 4D). A condensed view of all chromosomes is shown on the bottom of he plot, and he blue vertical bars represent significant genes. A detailed two-sided Manhattan plot in Figure 4D provides an exploded view of the 5Mb region on Chr. 6 with up-facing (male) and down-facing (female) bars in blue and red, respectively. This region covers in part the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus (Figure 4D). This visualization further emphasizes the apparent sex-dependent genetic effects. In this example, the male-specific genes mostly span $1\mathrm{MB}$ of he region position $27.5\mathrm{Mb}$ o $28.5\mathrm{Mb}$ ) while the female strong genetic signal is primarily within the MHC locus. Figure 4E lists the top 20 genes sorted by q-value and their chromosomal position. Each row indicates the results by the selected population group (M or F). Note that the signal for the $\mathrm{~F~}$ group is stronger (indicated by the corrected FDR value).

We illustrated the Association page for unspecified haematuria coded by ICD-10 R31, focusing on the top associated genes rom he emale group, PPP1R18 Protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 18) (Figure 4E).

The rest of the variants are listed according to their association statistics and calculated odds ratio.  

We provide information on the impact of the gene on the phenotype by partitioning the population at all possible thresholds o maximize he gene effect according o he PWAS damaging score) on ICD-10 R31 in the female group. The population partition view of dominant and recessive genepopulation analysis is shown with $2\times2$ contingency tables used for the Fisher’s exact statistics. Specifically, we show that by considering the dominant model of PPP1R18 in $27\%$ of the female group that have the lower score for the effect size (i.e. more damaged), he prevalence of unspecified haematuria is slightly lower (Figure 5C). This is converted to a prevalence of $3.24\%$ (matched with cases of 1,327 female individuals), while the rest of the affected females have a higher prevalence of $4.03\%$ . A similar trend was found by considering the gene for the recessive mode (light green). The partition threshold shows that for 1,502 females with R31 $30\%$ of the population with maximal damage of the PPP1R18 gene), the risk is suppressed by $20\%$ relative to the rest of the female population. Partition of the population signifies a potential benefit in assessing gene-centric disease risk. n a detailed example of the R31 phenotype, the PPP1R18 gene signifies reduced risk.  

# Discussion  

PWAS (Proteome-Wide Association Study) Hub is a database designed to analyze gene-phenotype associations through protein-coding variants and their predicted effects on protein function, enabling a better understanding of complex diseases (10 . PWAS Hub offers results on gene associations alongside comprehensive statistical analysis and visualization ools, with a key focus on inspecting sex-dependent genetics (25 . PWAS Hub V1.2 is an expanded database with additional features that covers hundreds of diseases and phenotypes from the UK Biobank (UKB), using both ICD-10 clinical diagnoses and the PheCode system. In contrast to GWAS that provide association from a genetic variant, the principal entity for PheWAS is a phenotype. We benefit from PheCode indexing schema of PheWAS which was created to gain insights on the genetic architecture of diseases and their comorbidities (19 .  

Unlike GWAS, which focuses on independent variants $\mathrm{\sim}10\mathrm{M}$ common variants across the genome), PWAS aggregates variants only from coding genes (640k variants) into gene effect scores. Additionally, PWAS uses an aggregation scheme that considers non-linear interactions based on recessive or dominant models, unlike GWAS’s routinely used additivity approach (see (10 ). Using the PWAS method for cancer predisposition genes in UKB, we found that the contribution of recessive inheritance is much larger than anticipated (24 . PWAS Hub also presents significant variants within coding regions cGWAS). To ensure nterpretability and consistency, he same variants are used in both PWAS and cGWAS analyses. On average, each phenotype was associated with 10.6 significant PWAS reported genes. Altogether, there are 589 of 819 phenotypes $(72\%)$ with at least one PWAS associated gene, while rest of the phenotypes failed to report on any significant associated genes.  

The rigorous and conservative statistical approach n PWAS minimizes type I errors (false positives), resulting in a limited discovery rate. Among phenotypes with high prevalence $(>2,000$ cases, 387 phenotypes), only $54\%$ were associated with gene discoveries hrough PWAS. We ound hat he PWAS protocol does not always guarantee gene identification. Examples include the large cohorts like Z82.4 (family history of ischemic heart disease, $^{12\mathrm{k}}$ ), N39 (other urinary system disorders, $18\mathrm{k}$ ) and H26 (cataract, 15k). This observation reflects the broad definitions of many phenotypes (e.g. PheCode_564.9, personal history of digestive system diseases) and the inclusion of phenotypes without obvious genetic basis (e.g. Phecode_760.0, Back pain). To ensure robustness, the analysis in PWAS Hub V1.2 is limited to phenotypes with $\mathord{>}400$ cases. Among the 819 tested phenotypes there are 220 phenotypes with $\geq10$ PWAS-based associated genes and nearly 600 phenotypes with at east one PWAS-associated gene. Currently, PWAS analysis uses 172 covariates, so phenotypes with fewer than 180 cases fail the protocol (marked -1, Summary page). However, he number of covariates can be reduced without significantly affecting the discovery rate (22 . Refinement by including a subset of critical covariates will be included in the upcoming PWAS Hub versions.  

A unique feature of PWAS Hub is the focusing on sex dependent genetics. The underlying genetic mechanisms of sex differences have been largely unexplored. In other cases, it was studied specifically via the direct effect of the sex chromosomes (17 . The clinical implications of addressing sex differences in medicine is evident. To this end, PWAS Hub provides a comparative view on males, emales and both for hundreds of phenotypes enabling a deeper understanding on the effect of sex on human health traits. We showed examples of complex diseases n which he difference n prevalence did not support a sex related genetic signal e.g. hypothyroidism 26 ) and other nstances n which PWAS method exposed a emalespecific signature (primary hypertension (23 ).  

PWAS Hub’s limitations stem from its reliance on coding genes, which account for less than $5\%$ of all genetic variants. As a result, important non-coding regions and regulatory elements (e.g. promoters, enhancers, untranslated regions) are not considered, despite their likely role in gene regulation and functional outcomes. Additionally, the data primarily represents individuals of European ancestry, limiting the generalizability of he results o other populations. Thus, PWAS Hub s best used in combination with other genetic association methods (27 . The platform offers filters that allow users to focus on specific features, such as selecting phenotypes based on the number of associated genes, inheritance models, or sex. Combining PWAS results with other association methods e.g. TWAS (13 ) enables an integrative approach that can enrich the understanding of diseases and phenotypes with complex etiologies (see example, (26 ).  

To address the limitations of PWAS Hub, future development that complies with best practice in research on human population genetics (28  will be implemented. This includes expanding the dataset to the diverse population within the UKB. Such update will increase the sample size from $280\mathrm{k}$ (v1.2) to $400\mathrm{k}$ . PWAS results are currently being tested for robustness and transferability in covering genetics beyond the European ancestry. The PWAS results will be compared to polygenic scores (PGSs) adjusted GWAS that was shown to increase statistical power for genetic association discovery across all ancestries (29 . Furthermore, future versions of PWAS Hub will incorporate non-coding regulatory regions and rare variants, such as hose dentified n exome sequencing studies 30 . By ntegrating his additional genetic nformation at he ndividual evel, PWAS Hub s expected o dentify more significant gene-disease associations, providing a basis for improving personalized treatment strategies.  

In summary, PWAS Hub s a valuable resource or exploring the genetic basis of complex diseases. Its ability to aggregate and analyze protein-coding variants offers a unique perspective on gene-phenotype associations. The focus on sex stratification highlights sex-related disease etiology. Exploring the PWAS Hub can have substantial mplications or personalized treatments, improved disease management, and understanding the genetic basis of many understudied complex diseases.

# ABSTRACT  

Here we present ComPPI, a cellular compartmentspecific database of proteins and their interactions enabling an extensive, compartmentalized protein– protein interaction network analysis (URL: http:// ComPPI.LinkGroup.hu). ComPPI enables the user to filter biologically unlikely interactions, where the two interacting proteins have no common subcellular localizations and to predict novel properties, such as compartment-specific biological functions. ComPPI is an integrated database covering four species (S cerevisiae, C elegans, D melanogaster and H sapiens). The compilation of nine protein– protein interaction and eight subcellular localization data sets had four curation steps including a manually built, comprehensive hierarchical structure of $>1600$ subcellular localizations. ComPPI provides confidence scores for protein subcellular localizations and protein–protein interactions. ComPPI has user-friendly search options for individual proteins giving their subcellular localization, their interactions and the likelihood of their interactions considering the subcellular localization of their interacting partners. Download options of search results, wholeproteomes, organelle-specific interactomes and subcellular localization data are available on its website. Due to its novel features, ComPPI is useful for the analysis of experimental results in biochemistry and molecular biology, as well as for proteome-wide studies in bioinformatics and network science helping cellular biology, medicine and drug design.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Biological processes are separated in the cellular and subcellular space, which helps their precise regulation. Compartmentalization of signalling pathways is a key regulator of several main biochemical processes, such as the nuclear translocation-mediated activation of transcription factors (1). Several proteins are located in more than one subcellular localizations. As an example, IGFBP-2 is a predominantly extracellular protein with a key role in insulin growth factor signalling (2), while its translocation into the nucleus results in vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated angiogenesis (3). Another important example is the HIF-1 Alpha with translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus, where it acts as a transcription factor involved in the maintenance of cellular oxygen homeostasis (4) (Supplementary Figure S1). Their shuttling between these localizations is a key regulatory mechanism, which implicates the importance of improving the systems level analysis of compartmentalized biological processes.  

Protein–protein interaction data are one of the most valuable sources for proteome-wide analysis (5), especially to understand human diseases on the systems-level (6) and to help network-related drug design (7). However, protein– protein interaction databases often contain data with low overlap (8), and are designed using different protocols (9), therefore, their integration is needed to improve our comprehensive knowledge (10). Low-throughput data sets often use several different protein naming conventions causing difficulties in data analysis and integration. Manual curation of data yields a large improvement of data quality (11).  

Interaction data often contain interactions, where the two interacting proteins have no common subcellular localizations (12). These interactions could be biophysically possible, but biologically unlikely (13). Thus, these interactions cause data bias that leads to deteriorated reliability in interactome-based studies (14), especially those involving subcellular localization-specific cellular processes (15). Unfortunately, subcellular localization data are incomplete. Despite the need of experimentally verified subcellular localizations for reliable compartmentalization-based interactome filtering (16), only computationally predicted subcellular localization information is available for a large part of the proteome. Moreover, subcellular localization data are redundant, often poorly structured and miss to highlight the reliability of data (17).  

Existing analysis tools involving subcellular localizations offer the download of filtered interactomes for a subset of proteins (like MatrixDB (18)). Several databases use only Gene Ontology (GO (19)) cellular component terms as the source of the subcellular localization data (such as HitPredict (20) or Cytoscape BiNGO plugin (21)), while GO still contains data inconsistency despite its highly structured annotations (22). Cytoscape Cerebral plugin (23) generates a view of the interactome separated into layers according to their subcellular localization. In different data sets the subcellular localization structure is not uniform, which makes their comparisons often difficult.  

ComPPI-based interactomes introduced here provide a broader coverage (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2), using several curation steps in data integration. ComPPI offers highly structured subcellular localization data supplemented with Localization and Interaction confidence Scores, all presented with user-friendly options. As a key feature ComPPI allows the construction of high-confidence data sets, where potentially biologically unlikely interactions in which the interacting partners are not localized in the same cellular compartment, have been deleted. As our examples will show, this gives novel options of interactome analysis and also suggests potentially new subcellular localizations and localization-based functions.  

# DESCRIPTION OF THE DATABASE  

# Overview of ComPPI  

Our goal by constructing ComPPI was to provide a reliable subcellular compartment-based protein–protein interaction database for the analysis of biological processes on the subcellular level. A key feature of ComPPI is that it allows the filtering of localization-based biologically unlikely interactions resulting in localization-wise more reliable interaction data. During the integration of 17 databases to build up ComPPI, we used the following four curation steps to improve data quality (Figure 1). (i) Source databases were selected by comparing them to a large number of other potential databases and their data content was manually reviewed. (ii) Subcellular localization data were consistently structured to a hierarchical subcellular localization tree (Supplementary Figure S2) containing more than 1600 individual sublocalizations. (iii) We developed an algorithm to map different protein naming conventions to UniProt accession numbers (24,25). (iv) Finally, a manual follow-up by six independent experts was performed in order to revise the data content searching for data inconsistence and false entries, and to test the functions of the web interface (Supplementary Table S3).  

ComPPI database includes comprehensive and integrated data of four species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae,  

![](images/11eddfb7ec9f32664771c257a2bb755ad02469d9441393afadffb8de7461854c.jpg)  

Figure 1. Flowchart of ComPPI construction highlighting the four curation steps. Constructing the ComPPI database we first checked the data content of 24 possible input databases for false entries, data inconsistence and compatible data structure in order to minimize the bias in ComPPI coming from the input sources (1). As a consequence we selected nine protein–protein interaction (BioGRID (29), CCSB (30), DiP (31), DroID (26), HPRD (27), IntAct (32), MatrixDB (18), MINT (33) and MIPS (28)) and eight subcellular localization databases (eSLDB (37), GO (19), Human Proteinpedia (34), LOCATE (38), MatrixDB (18), OrganelleDB (39), PA-GOSUB (36) and The Human Protein Atlas (35)) in order to integrate them into the ComPPI data set. The subcellular localization structure was manually annotated creating a hierarchic, non-redundant subcellular localization tree using $>1600$ GO cellular component terms (19) for the standardization of the different data resolution and naming conventions (2). All input databases were connected to the ComPPI core database with newly built interfaces in order to improve data consistency, to allow easy extensibility with new databases and to incorporate automatic database updates. As part of the curation steps the filtering efficiency of our newly built interfaces were tested on 200 random proteins for every input databases, and the interfaces were accepted only when all the requested false-entries and data content errors were filtered, in order to establish a more reliable content (Supplementary Table S3). During data integration, different protein naming conventions were mapped to the most reliable protein name. In this process we used publicly available mapping tables (UniProt (24) and HPRD (27)). For $30\%$ of protein names we applied manually built mapping tables with the help of online ID cross-reference services (PICR (25) and Synergizer (http://llama.mshri.on.ca/synergizer/ translate/)) (3). After data integration Localization and Interaction Scores were calculated (for detailed description see Figure 2). As an illustration we show the example of Figure 2 with two interacting proteins (nodes A and B corresponding to HSP 90-alpha A2 and Survivin, respectively) with shared cytosolic and nuclear localizations (light blue and orange). Node B has an additional membrane (yellow) subcellular localization and an extracellular localization (green). Numbers in the circles of nodes A and B refer to their Localization Scores. The Interaction Score of nodes A and B is 0.99 (see Figure 2 for details). The integrated ComPPI data set was manually revised by six independent experts (4). During the revision two of the six experts tested our database on 200 random proteins each to ensure high-quality control requirements, and searched for exact matches between the entries in the input sources and the ComPPI data set. All the experts searched for false entries, data inconsistency, protein name mapping errors in the downloadable data and tested the operation of the online services as well. After the revision we updated our source databases, their interfaces, the subcellular localization tree and the algorithm generating the downloadable data, in order to acquire all the changes proposed during the tests. As the final result, the webpage http://ComPPI.LinkGroup.hu is available for search and download options in order to extract the biological information in a user-friendly way.  

Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens) cataloguing 125 757 proteins, their 791 059 interactions and 195 815 major subcellular localizations in its current, 1.1 version. The proteome-wide data set contains localizations for five main subcellular organelles (nucleus, mitochondrion, cytosol, secretory-pathway, membrane) and the extracellular compartment. Importantly, $60\%$ of the ComPPI entries have high resolution cellular localization data assigning them to one or several of $>1600$ GO cellular component terms (19) associating these proteins with distinct subcellular compartments.  

# Design and implementation  

Both protein–protein interaction and subcellular localization data are incorporated to ComPPI automatically using their own interface to bridge the difference in data structure (Supplementary Table S3). New interfaces can be added without limitations. The incoming data are merged to form a consistent internal data pool using a comprehensive protein name mapping algorithm, in order to deal with the redundancy in the input data sets (http://comppi.linkgroup. hu/help/naming conventions). The website and the downloadable contents are generated from this integrated internal data pool. All curated parts are stored in separate, yet interconnected containers to maintain persistency between ComPPI releases.  

The website follows the hierarchical model-viewcontroller design pattern to ensure the separation of the data layer from the business logic and the user interface. Each functional unit is implemented as a module to further support easy maintenance and extensibility. Protein search algorithms have been extensively optimized, and the served content is cached to ensure quick response times even on low-end infrastructure. Due to these features ComPPI can be easily run on a general laptop or desktop computer.  

The downloadable data sets are pre-generated and validated automatically and manually in every release to fulfill our high quality control requirements (Figure 1). The Python script that generates these data sets also contains basic tools for data retrieval and manipulation in a networkoriented manner, which enables the user to perform bioinformatics analysis on the interactome using the open source code and also gives space for further improvement.  

End-user documentation is available at the website as tutorials, detailed descriptions and location-specific tooltips. All components of ComPPI and the underlying software stack are open source. The source code is available in a revision controlled repository at http://bificomp2.sote.hu: 22422/comppi/summary.  

Third-party tools and technologies were selected with open accessibility and scientific reproducibility in mind including the Ubuntu Linux 14.04 operating system (http: //ubuntu.com/), the nginx HTTP server (http://nginx.org/), the MySQL 5 Community Edition database server (http: //www.mysql.com/), the git version control system (http: //git-scm.com/), the PHP 5 scripting language (https://php. net/), the Symfony 2 PHP framework (http://symfony.com/), the jQuery JavaScript framework (http://jquery.com/), the D3.js JavaScript library for network visualization (http: //d3js.org/) and the Python3 scripting language (https:// python.org/).  

# Database content and access  

Input databases. The low overlap of protein–protein interaction and subcellular localization databases (11) prompted us to integrate several source databases in order to improve data coverage and quality (Supplementary Figure S3 and Supplementary Table S2). In this process we used publicly downloadable license-free data sources, preferably containing proteome-wide data sets. Protein–protein interaction data were selected to contain only physical interactions with experimental evidence coming from high-throughput, as well as low-throughput techniques. We incorporated the widely used species-specific (DroID (26), HPRD (27), MatrixDB (18) and MIPS (28)) and general (BioGRID (29), CCSB (30), DiP (31), IntAct (32) and MINT (33)) protein– protein interaction databases having high data quality, update frequency and freely downloadable latest releases for academic research.  

Subcellular localization data can be obtained from experimental evidence or using predictions. Several source databases contained only experimentally verified subcellular localization entries (such as Human Proteinpedia (34) and the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) (35)). Other source data had only computationally predicted information (such as PA-GOSUB (36)). Several data sources had integrated data structure (such as eSLDB (37), GO (19), LOCATE (38), MatrixDB (18), OrganelleDB (39)) containing data of both experimental and predicted origin. During the selection of the proteome-wide predicted subcellular localization databases with downloadable content we focused on the use of prediction algorithms with combined methods using robust machine learning tools validated on highly reliable training sets.  

ComPPI data set. The availability of the data sources differs between various species. As an example ComPPI contains eight protein–protein interaction and eight subcellular localization databases for human proteins (Supplementary Figure S3). Database integration was based on protein ID mapping to the most reliable naming convention available, primarily to UniProt Swiss-Prot accession numbers (11). The 4 curation steps (Figure 1) allow the users to access interaction and localization data at a single resource having a higher coverage and reliability than the incorporated databases.  

The ComPPI database contains three types of predefined data sets: (i) the compartmentalized interactome catalogues of those protein–protein interactions, where the interacting proteins have at least one common subcellular localization, (ii) the integrated protein–protein interaction data set which can be customized by the four species included and (iii) the subcellular localization data set, which is one of the biggest existing subcellular localization resource with a comprehensive structure for interactome analysis. All downloadable ComPPI resources are license free and publicly available for academic and industrial research.  

# Search and download features  

Search features. The internally hyper-linked web application of ComPPI enables even those users, who have no bioinformatics expertise, to search for the interactions of individual proteins. Search options (http://comppi.linkgroup. hu/protein search) are available for protein names with autocomplete function giving their subcellular localization, their interactions and the likelihood of their interactions considering the subcellular localization of the interacting partners. Using the Advanced Settings of the Search page the user is able to filter the list of the possible query proteins for species, subcellular localizations and/or localization probability. These settings can be set for the interactors of the query protein too and are adjustable with the Custom Settings on the Results page, which allows the filtering of the interactors for subcellular localizations, localization probability and interaction score. The properties of the query protein and its interactors are available for download. After filtration only those interactions are exported that fulfill the custom filtering requirements set by the user. Network visualization of the whole or filtered first-neighbour interactome of the query protein is also available, where the width of the edges corresponds to the Interaction Score of the given interaction. These options together provide a user-friendly web interface for data mining for both nonexperts and computational biologists. A Direct Search option is also available via URL, which gives the opportunity to interconnect the ComPPI database with other resources, or to generate multiple searches for data mining.  

Download options. All ComPPI data are available for download at the website. Predefined data sets can be customized by the user to contain only data for a requested species or localization: (i) Compartmentalized interactomes have interactions, where the two interacting protein-nodes have at least one common subcellular localization. These interactomes can be filtered to species besides subcellular localizations. (ii) Integrated protein–protein interaction data sets contain all the interactions, and can be customized to the four species included. (iii) Integrated subcellular localization data sets contain proteins together with their localization data. The user can select species and localizations to customize these data sets. (iv) The current and previous releases of the full database can also be downloaded. A detailed help and a tutorial for the Search and Download functions are both available.  

Output. ComPPI output data provide lists of interactions, interaction scores of the interacting proteins and localizations with localization scores. Moreover, the user receives the PubMed IDs and references of the source databases for both the interactions and subcellular localizations, and the additional information (if available) of the data type. The user-defined interactomes as results of the Basic or Advanced Search options and the predefined data sets on the Downloads page are available for download in plain text format to ensure convenient data handling. The complete current and previous releases of the database are downloadable in SQL format to provide full access to all the data in ComPPI.  

# Localization and interaction scores  

Subcellular localization structure. Subcellular localization data are coming from different source databases, containing localizations having experimental evidence (in the followings: experimental), coming from unknown sources (unknown) or predictions (predicted; Figure 2). Experimental data usually have high resolution, where the exact localization of the protein is often defined, such as the nuclear pore complex for Nup107 (40). Predicted localizations have usually low resolution. As an example nuclear localization can be predicted from the existence of a nuclear localization signal in the amino acid sequence (41) without any experimental evidence.  

Because of the incongruity in the resolution of the localization data and the different naming conventions between the source databases, we standardized the subcellular localization data using GO cellular component terms (19). In order to solve the problem of the unequivocally mapped GO terms (Figure 3) we created a manually built, non-redundant, hierarchical localization tree (Supplementary Figure S2). With the help of this we clustered the $>1600$ GO cellular component terms to six major compartments (cytosol, nucleus, mitochondrion, secretory-pathway, membrane, extracellular) (Supplementary Table S4). This new structure allows ComPPI to store all localization entries from different sources and to assign the proteins efficiently to six major compartments (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S4).  

Localization and interaction scores. The ComPPI Localization Score is a novel measure to score the probability of a localization for a given protein. The Localization Score depends on the subcellular localization evidence type (experimental, unknown, predicted) and the number of sources (Figure 2). The Interaction Score characterizes the probability of the subcellular localization of a protein– protein interaction, and is based on the consensus of the compartment-specific Localization Scores of the interacting proteins. With the help of the scoring algorithm ComPPI provides a novel localization probability describing how likely it is that the protein exists in the given subcellular compartment, and gives the opportunity to build highconfidence interactomes based on the distribution of the interaction scores (Supplementary Figure S5).  

Localization Scores are calculated using probabilistic disjunction (marked with operator $V$ ) among the different localization evidence types and the number of ComPPI localization data entries of the respective evidence type (Equation (1), see top panel of Figure 2 for details)  

$$
\varphi_{\mathrm{LocX}}=V_{\mathrm{res}}p_{\mathrm{LocX}}
$$  

where $\varphi_{\mathrm{LocX}}$ and $p_{\mathrm{LocX}}$ are the Localization Score and the localization evidence type (experimental, unknown or predicted) for protein $\mathbf{X}$ and localization Loc, respectively, while res is the number of available ComPPI localization data entries for protein $\mathrm{\DeltaX}$ .  

As the first step of Interaction Score calculation, compartment-specific Interaction Scores are obtained by multiplying the Localization Scores of the two interactors for each of the six major compartments. Finally, the Interaction Score is calculated as the probabilistic disjunction (marked with operator $V$ ) of the Compartment-specific Interaction Scores of all major localizations available for the interacting pair from the maximal number of six major localizations (Equation (2), see bottom panel of Figure 2 for details)  

$$
\varphi_{\mathrm{Int}}=V_{i=1}^{6}\varphi_{\mathrm{LocA}}*\varphi_{\mathrm{LocB}}
$$  

where $\varphi_{\mathrm{Int}}$ is the Interaction Score, while $\varphi_{\mathrm{LocA}}$ and $\varphi_{\mathrm{LocB}}$ are the Compartment-specific Localization Scores of interacting proteins A and B, respectively.

Figure 2. Calculation of the subcellular localization-based ComPPI scores. We illustrate the Localization Score calculation steps on the examples of Heat Shock Protein (HSP) 90-apha A2 and Survivin. HSP 90-alpha A2 has two major subcellular localizations, while Survivin has four (ϕnucleusA, $\varphi_{\mathrm{cytoA}}$ and ϕextracellularB, ϕmembraneB, ϕnucleusB, ϕcytoB, respectively) ns were manuall categorized into major localizations before the calculation (see the text in section ‘Subcellular Localization Stru calization Score (such as $\bar{\Psi}\mathrm{cytoA}$ ) calculated for every available major subcellular localization for both HSP 90-alpha A2 and Su aliz of the respective localization data entries (corresponding to $p_{\mathrm{LocX}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{rec}}$ alc alization evidence type weights of 0.8, 0.7 and 0.3 for experimental, edi optimization procedure see section ‘Score Optimization’ of th the respective protein to belong to a major co nd the number of ComPPI localization data entries of the $(\varphi_{\mathrm{Int}})$ the Localization Scores of the interacting proteins.

Figure 3. Advantages of ComPPI subcellular localization structure. The subcellular localization structure of ComPPI is based on a manually curated, non-redundant subcellular localization tree extracted from GO data (19) containing more than $1600\mathrm{~GO}$ cellular component terms (Supplementary Figure S2). On Figure 3 an example of the redundancy in the GO cellular component tree structure is shown, where the ‘nuclear pore’ cellular component can be found under several branches in the tree, such as in the ‘nucleus’ $\J\to$ ‘nuclear envelope’ $\mathord{\left.\vert{\begin{array}{r l}\end{array}}\right.}\mathord{\left.-\begin{array}{r l}\end{array}\right.}$ ‘nuclear pore’ or the ‘membrane’ $\mathord{\left.\vert\begin{array}{r l}\end{array}\right.}\mathord{\left.-\begin{array}{r l}\end{array}\right.}$ ‘membrane part’ $\J\to$ ‘intrinsic component of the membrane’ $\ J>$ ‘integral component of the membrane’ $\mathbf{-}>$ ‘pore complex’ pathways (highlighted in red). Because of the need of the mapping of high-resolution subcellular localization data into major cellular components (Supplementary Table S4) a localization tree with a non-redundant structure was built. In our example, it can be seen that with the help of this structure the ‘nuclear pore’ derives unequivocally from the ‘nuclear envelope’ term (highlighted in green).  

Score optimization. As mentioned before the ComPPI localization evidence type can be experimental, unknown or predicted. ComPPI characterizes each of these localization evidence types by a parameter called the evidence type weight to achieve a unified scoring system applicable to the diverse data sources. To obtain these evidence type weights we performed their data-driven optimization. Based on the fact that experimentally validated entries are the most reliable, while localization entries coming from unknown or predicted origin are less reliable, we set the following order of evidence type weights: experimental $>$ predicted AND experimental $>$ unknown as the two requirements of the optimization process. We chose the HPA database (35) containing only experimentally verified subcellular localizations in order to build a positive control data set, where the interactors have at least one common localization according to HPA. Our goal was to find a specific ratio of the experimental, unknown and predicted evidence type weights that maximizes the number of high confidence interactions in the positive control data set (HPA) and simultaneously maximizes the number of low confidence interactions in the ComPPI data set not containing HPA data. These ensure that the quality of data marked as high confidence will have a good match to the quality of experimentally verified data.  

All combinations of the experimental, unknown and predicted evidence type weights were set up from 0 to 1 with 0.1 increments. The kernel density of the interactions were calculated with all these settings (with a bandwidth of 0.01), which gave us the ratio of interactions belonging to a given confidence level compared to the distribution of all the interactions. Finally, the 285 possible kernel density solutions were tested to find the parameter combination that maximizes the number of both the low and high confidence interactions as described above. This resulted in 0.8, 0.7 and 0.3 as the relative evidence type weights for experimental, predicted and unknown data types, respectively (Supplementary Figure S6). Note that this optimization is driven by the reliability of the subcellular localization data, and was not tested using gold standard protein–protein interaction data sets, therefore the Interaction Score reflects the reliability of the interaction in a subcellular localization-dependent but not in an interactome-dependent manner.  

# Application examples  

Merging of subcellular localization and interactome data provides several application opportunities: (i) the filtration of localization-based biologically unlikely interactions––where the two interacting proteins have no common localization and (ii) the prediction of possible new localizations and localization-based biological functions (15). Both are important features of ComPPI as illustrated by an example in this section.  

ComPPI-based interaction filtering. First, we made a systematic search for an example, which highlights the importance of the removal of localization-based biologically unlikely interactions looking for key hubs and bridges, where interaction structure changed the most after the filtering step. Here we calculated the degree distribution of the whole human interactome and the high-confidence interactome (containing 23 265/19 386 proteins and their 385 481/260 829 interactions, respectively) where from the latter biologically unlikely interactions with no common subcellular localizations have already been removed. We also calculated the distribution of the betweenness centrality in the two data sets. After these procedures we manually reviewed the first 20 proteins from the UniProt Swiss-Prot subset (15 258 proteins out of 19 386) with the highest differences in degree and centrality measures (Supplementary Table S5). EnoylCoA hydratase (crotonase) had the largest absolute change of degree among the top 20 proteins, thus we selected crotonase as our illustrative example (Figure 4). Crotonase catalyses the second step in the beta-oxidation pathway of fatty acid metabolism (42), and is a key member of the crotonase protein superfamily (43). Beta-oxidation takes place primarily in the mitochondrion (44). Crotonase has only a mitochondrial ComPPI localization with experimental evidence, which is in agreement with its cellular function.  

Crotonase has 71 interacting partners in the integrated data set, of which only 8 is present in the mitochondrion, and only 5 have an interaction score equal or higher than 0.8. After the manual review of crotonase neighbours, it turned out that only one of the 8 mitochondrial interactors (mitochondrial Hsp70, (45)) has experimental evidence for mitochondrial localization. Mitochondrial localization of the other 7 interactors is not based on strong evidence, while 63 out of 71 interactors have no known mitochondrial localization at all. Figure 4 shows the interactome of crotonase and its 71 first neighbours containing 428 edges. In the mitochondrial interaction subset only 13 edges remained, while the high-confidence part contains only 10 interactions (Figure 4). Second neighbours of crotonase contain $82\%$ of the interactome, and their network contains 14 803 nodes and 319 305 edges. The filtered mitochondrial network of the second neighbours is much smaller, having only 2107 nodes and 8381 interactions.  

![](images/e35417b2f77d65db9077a18fa5a9fc54dbf50abc7edd1bd2ef7073218fabdad0.jpg)  
Figure 4. Advantages of the ComPPI data set to filter biologically unlikely interactions and to predict compartment-specific, new properties and functions. The figure shows the interactions of crotonase (enoyl-CoA hydratase, UniProt ID: P30084), involved in fatty acid catabolism having a mitochondrial localization, and its first neighbours supported with experimental evidence before and after filtering to mitochondrial localization. Interactions with an Interaction Score below 0.80 are shown with dashed lines. On one hand, out of the original 71 neighbours of crotonase only 8 remain as mitochondrial interacting partners with a significantly higher average Interaction Score than the whole first-neighbour network, which highlights the importance of compartment-specific filtering in the detection of highconfidence interactors in a subcellular localization-dependent manner. On the other hand, the blue circle of the upper left side of the figure shows those cytosolic crotonase interacting partners, which are involved in apoptosis, a recently discovered function of crotonase (45–47). Thus, the very same example also reveals a potential new function of crotonase, which partially involves its unexpected cytosolic localization, which was recently verified experimentally (46).  

ComPPI-based prediction of new or non-conventional functions. Importantly, 52 out of the 71 interactors, and more specifically, 7 out of the 8 mitochondrial interacting partners of crotonase have cytosolic localization with a localization probability over 0.95. This indicates that crotonase may have a cytosolic localization as well. Indeed, crotonase was shown to be overexpressed and localized in the cytosol in hepatocarcinoma cells, where it contributes to lymphatic metastatis (46). GO (19) biological process term enrichment analysis of the mitochondrial crotonase interacting partners using BiNGO (21) revealed that besides the known function of the crotonase in ‘catabolic process’ the ‘negative regulation of apoptosis’ and related terms were also significantly enriched (Supplementary Table S6). In agreement with this, previous studies showed that crotonase is overexpressed in several cancer types (47), and the knockdown of crotonase decreased cell viability and enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma (48). The anti-apoptotic effect of crotonase also exists in breast cancer, where its down-regulation potentiates PP2-induced apoptosis (49).  

These findings may implicate that the high ratio of ‘biologically unlikely’ interactions may also be a result of a transient and dynamic cytosolic subcellular localization of crotonase, where the enzyme may be involved in currently not widely crotonase-associated biological processes, such as the inhibition of apoptosis. Importantly, these compartment-specific crotonase functions may be applied as potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma or breast cancer.  

In summary, the crotonase example shows the utility of ComPPI both (i) to filter low-confidence interactions concentrating on high-confidence subcellular localizations and (ii) to predict unknown biological functions in previously unknown or non-conventional subcellular localizations. Another example of ComPPI-based prediction of potential, novel functions besides crotonase, is Monopolar Spindle 1 protein (MPS1) having a centromere-associated cytosolic localization (50). We identified a number of relatively undiscovered MPS1 functions related to the ComPPI analysis of nuclear MPS1 interactome as detailed in Supplementary Figure S7 and Supplementary Table S6.  

# CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS  

In summary, ComPPI provides a unique data set for the analysis of protein–protein interaction networks at the subcellular level. The assembly of the integrated ComPPI database with manual curation protocols (Figure 1) provides an improvement of both coverage and data quality. ComPPI subcellular localization data have a novel structure in order to incorporate localizations from different data sources (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S4), and to reveal compartment-specific biological functions based on the analysis of the interactomes extended with high-resolution localization data in a hierarchical structure. With the use of the optimized Localization and Interaction Scores (Figure 2) high-confidence interactomes could be created for further investigation in the field of compartment-specific biological processes (15).  

Comparison of integrated protein–protein interaction data and the compartmentalized interactome allow the filtering of biologically unlikely interactions, where the interacting partners have no common subcellular localization. Our examples (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S7) illustrate that besides filtering, ComPPI has a strong predictive power to find new localizations of the proteins based on the underlying network or to suggest new compartmentspecific biological functions. The comprehensive data set for four species gives the opportunity to analyse evolutionary aspects of the compartmentalization, such as the prediction of subcellular localization ortologes (‘localogs’).  

The web interface of ComPPI (http://ComPPI. LinkGroup.hu) provides user-friendly search and download options. Besides the basic Search feature to explore and download the interactions of individual proteins, Advanced Settings could be applied to both query proteins and their interactors. Interactome-wide studies could be applied using the downloadable compartment-specific interactomes or the integrated protein–protein interaction data set, while the integrated subcellular localization data set is also available on the webpage for further analyses.  

ComPPI is available at http://ComPPI.LinkGroup.hu, and has an open source code, which allows further improvement and the construction of ‘ComPPI-based databases’. ComPPI is a community-annotated resource, which will be continuously enriched by a user community of experts helped by a public issue-tracking system and by feedbacks from the core-team, and will be updated and upgraded annually for minimum 5 years.  

We plan to resolve current ComPPI limitations, such as the relatively low amount $29\%$ of total) of experimental subcellular localization entries with the incorporation of newly available experimental data. Future plans include the development of improved gold standard-based Localization and network neighbourhood-based Interaction Scores, as well as further advanced download and search options, such as advanced localization-based network visualization and extended number of output formats.  

In summary, the ComPPI-based interactomes introduced here provide a broader coverage, offer highly structured subcellular localization data, as well as offer Localization and Interaction confidence Scores, all in a user-friendly manner. Importantly, ComPPI enables the user to filter biologically unlikely interactions, where the two interacting proteins have no common subcellular localizations, and to predict novel subcellular localization as well as localizationbased properties, such as compartment-specific biological functions.

# ABSTRACT  

ViruSurf, available at http://gmql.eu/virusurf/, is a large public database of viral sequences and integrated and curated metadata from heterogeneous sources (RefSeq, GenBank, COG-UK and NMDC); it also exposes computed nucleotide and amino acid variants, called from original sequences. A GISAIDspecific ViruSurf database, available at http://gmql. eu/virusurf gisaid/, offers a subset of these functionalities. Given the current pandemic outbreak, SARSCoV-2 data are collected from the four sources; but ViruSurf contains other virus species harmful to humans, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola and Dengue. The database is centered on sequences, described from their biological, technological and organizational dimensions. In addition, the analytical dimension characterizes the sequence in terms of its annotations and variants. The web interface enables expressing complex search queries in a simple way; arbitrary search queries can freely combine conditions on attributes from the four dimensions, extracting the resulting sequences. Several example queries on the database confirm and possibly improve results from recent research papers; results can be recomputed over time and upon selected populations. Effective search over large and curated sequence data may enable faster responses to future threats that could arise from new viruses.  

# INTRODUCTION  

The pandemic outbreak of the coronavirus disease COVID19, caused by the virus species SARS-CoV-2, has created unprecedented attention toward the genetic mechanisms of viruses. The sudden outbreak has also shown that the research community is generally unprepared to face pandemic crises in a number of aspects, including well-organized databases and search systems. We respond to such urgent need by means of a novel integrated database and search system collecting and curating virus sequences with their properties. Data are captured, standardized, organized and made accessible to the scientific community, so as to facilitate current and future research studies.  

In our work, we are driven by the Viral Conceptual Model (VCM) for virus sequences (1), which was recently developed by interviewing a variety of experts of the various aspects of virus research (including clinicians, epidemiologists, drug and vaccine developers). The conceptual model is general and applies to any virus. The sequence of the virus is the central information; sequences are analyzed from a biological dimension describing the virus species and the host environment; a technological dimension describing the sequencing technology; an organizational dimension describing the project that was responsible for producing the sequence; and an analytical dimension describing properties of the sequence, such as known annotations and variants. Annotations include known genes, coding and untranslated regions, and so on. Variants are extracted by performing data analysis and include both nucleotide variants––with respect to the reference sequence for the specific species––with their impact, and amino acid variants related to the genes.  

We have previously proposed another conceptual model focused on human genomics (2), which was based on a central entity representing files of genomic regions, similarly described from various dimensions. We next developed and implemented an integrated database (3), searchable through the GenoSurf (4) interface (http://gmql.eu/ genosurf/). Thanks to such previous knowledge in human genomics, we have been able to rapidly design VCM and then to deploy ViruSurf.  

Currently, ViruSurf includes reference sequences from RefSeq (5) and regular sequences from GenBank (6) of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-related coronavirus, as well as MERS-CoV, Ebola and Dengue viruses; the pipeline is generic and other virus species will be progressively added next, giving precedence to those species which are most harmful to humans. For what concerns SARS-CoV-2, we also include sequences from COG-UK (7) and NMDC (http://nmdc.cn/). GenBank and COG-UK data are made publicly available and can be freely downloaded and redistributed. Special arrangements have been agreed with GISAID (8,9), resulting in a GISAID-enabled version of ViruSurf. Due to constraints imposed by GISAID, the database exposed in this version lacks the original sequences, certain metadata and nucleotide variants; moreover, GISAID requires their dataset not to be merged with other datasets. Hence, the two versions of ViruSurf should be used separately, and a certain amount of integration effort must be carried out by the user.  

Table 1. Summary of ViruSurf content as of 4 August 2020. For each taxon name (identified by a taxon ID and rank) and each source, we specify the number of distinct sequences and the reference genome; we also provide the average number of annotations, nucleotide variants and amino acid variants per sequence. The GISAID-only entry refers to those GISAID sequences that are not also present in the other three sources

Although the origin sources provide well-organized data portals (NCBI Virus (10), the COVID-19 Data Portal https: //www.covid19dataportal.org/ and GISAID EpiCoVTM data browser), these do not allow for an integrated search over multiple sources, nor they provide fast selection using sequence variants. A number of other integrated interfaces are being developed in alternative research contexts: UCSC SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser (11); 2019nCoVR (12) at the Chinese National Genomics Data Center; VirusDIP (13) at the China National GeneBank; CovSeq (14); and CARD (15). Compared to other resources, ViruSurf has much stronger query and search capabilities; we use the power of conceptual modeling to structure metadata and to organize data integration and curation; we support search queries allowing to combine filters on metadata, nucleotide and amino acid mutations in an effective and scalable way, treating all of them as first-class citizens. The closest comparison is with CoV-GLUE (16) (only containing GISAID data), which includes variants, but forces users to search one variant at a time, visualizing the list of sequences with that variant.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Database content  

For SARS-CoV-2, ViruSurf contains data from four main data sources: NCBI (including Genbank and RefSeq),  

COG-UK, NMDC and GISAID. We also reviewed other available sources (GenomeWarehouse and CNGdb) but observed that they do not add substantial value to the integration effort, as most of their sequences overlap with those stored in the four cited sources.  

Table 1 provides a description of the current ViruSurf content: for each virus we report the rank, ID and name from NCBI Taxonomy, the number of sequences included from each source and the reference sequence. We next provide the average number per sequence of each annotation and nucleotide/amino acid variants computed against the reference sequence. Note that, although GISAID uses a different reference sequence, provided amino acid variants are relative to protein sequences (which are the same as in other sources), hence they can be compared with other variants.  

Some content of ViruSurf is extracted from the sources and used without changes; some is manually curated; and some is computed in-house (nucleotide and amino acid variants, impact, quality measures). The code repository is available on GitHub (https://github.com/DEIB-GECO/ virusurf downloader). The current content corresponds to data available at the sources on 4 August 2020. We will provide periodical updates on a monthly basis.  

# Relational schema  

The core schema, represented in Figure 1, is inspired to classic data marts (17), with a central fact table describing the SEQUENCE, featuring several characterizing attributes, and then four dimensions:  

(1) The Biological dimension (including the VIRUS and HOSTSAMPLE tables) is concerned with the virus species characterization and the host organism, including the temporal/spatial information regarding the extraction of the biological sample.   
(2) The Technological dimension (EXPERIMENTTYPE table) describes the sequencing method.   
(3) The Organizational dimension (SEQUENCINGPROJECT table) describes the project producing each sequence.  

![](images/126a4d9ff6a2115db78f91df01af270c583910181fc33e48aada0d400129e218.jpg)  
Figure 1. Logical schema of the relational database in the back-end of ViruSurf.  

(4) The Analytical dimension provides annotations for specific sub-sequences and characterizes the variants in the nucleotide sequence and in the amino acid sequence. It includes the ANNOTATION, AMINOACIDVARIANT, NUCLEOTIDEVARIANT and VARIANTIMPACT.  

All tables have a numerical sequential primary key (PK), conventionally named using the table name and the postfix ‘ id’, and indicated as PK in Figure 1; we indicate with foreign keys (FK) the relationships from a non-key attribute to a primary key attribute of a different table. Relationships from the SEQUENCE towards VIRUS, HOSTSAMPLE, SEQUENCINGPROJECT and EXPERIMENTTYPE are functional (e.g. one SEQUENCE has one EXPERIMENTTYPE, while an EXPERIMENTTYPE may be the same for multiple SEQUENCE); instead, relationships in the analytical dimension are 1:N (e.g. one SEQUENCE has many ANNOTATIONS, and an ANNOTATION has many AMINOACIDVARIANTS). In the Supplementary Table S1, we describe the specific attributes of every table.  

# Data import  

The pipeline used to import the content of the ViruSurf database from sources is shown in Figure 2. We use different download protocols for each source:  

• For NCBI data (including GenBank and RefSeq sequences), we employ the extraction tools available in the E-utilities (18): the Python APIs allows to retrieve one complex XML file for each sequence ID available in NCBI.   
• COG-UK instead provides a single MultiFASTA file on its website (https://www.cogconsortium.uk/data/); this is associated with a text file for metadata.   
• NMDC exposes an FTP server with FASTA files for each sequence, while metadata are captured directly from the HTML description pages.   
• GISAID provides to us an export file in JSON format, updated every $15~\mathrm{min}$ . The file is produced by GISAID technical team in an ad-hoc agreed form for ViruSurf.  

Automatic pipelines have been implemented to extract metadata and fill the SEQUENCE, VIRUS, HOSTSAMPLE, SEQUENCINGPROJECT, and EXPERIMENTTYPE tables; some attributes require data curation, as next described.  

# Annotation and variant calling  

In order to provide homogeneous information for sequence annotations and variants, we use a unique annotation procedure for GenBank, COG-UK and NMDC; resulting variants for amino acid sequences are consistent with those provided by GISAID. We extract: structural annotations, nucleotide and amino acid sequences for each annotated segment, nucleotide variants and their impact, amino acid variants for the proteins and other information such as percentage of specific nucleotide bases.  

For each virus, we manually select a reference sequence and a set of annotations, comprising coordinates for codifying and structural regions, as well as the amino acid sequences of each protein. Usually, such data are taken from the RefSeq entry for the given virus (e.g. NC 045512 for SARS-CoV-2). For each imported sequence, the pipeline starts by computing the optimal global alignment to the reference by means of the dynamic programming NeedlemanWunsch (NW) algorithm (19). The time and space complexity of NW is quadratic in the length of the aligned sequences, which often hinders its adoption in genomics, but viral sequences are relatively short, thus we can use NW rather than faster heuristic methods. We configured the algorithm to use an affine gap penalty, so as to favor longer gaps which are very frequent at the ends of sequences.  

Once the alignment is computed, all the differences from the reference sequence are collected in the form of variants (substitutions, insertions or deletions). Using the SnpEff tool (20), we annotate each variant and predict its impact on the codifying regions; indeed, a variant may, for example, be irrelevant (e.g when the mutated codon codifies for the same amino acid of the original codon), produce small changes or be deleterious. Based on the alignment result, the sub-sequences corresponding to the reference annotations are identified within the input sequence.  

![](images/a73f9ec859b6c65f803772bace73234fcb8c51decdb822403675c97ab7d9d583.jpg)  
Figure 2. General pipeline of the ViruSurf platform. For given sources and species, we use download procedures to construct content, perform data curation, and load the content into two distinct databases, for GISAID and for the other sources, which are schema-compatible (the former is a subset of the latter). We then provide two Web-based interfaces supporting search and result inspection.  

Coding regions are then translated into their equivalent amino acid sequences; the translation takes into consideration annotated ribosomial frameshifts events (e.g. within the ORF1ab gene of SARS-CoV-2). When translation fails (e.g. because the nucleotide sequence retrieved from the alignment is empty or its length is not a multiple of 3), we ignore the amino acid product; failures are due to incompleteness and poor quality of the input sequence, further computation of amino acid variants would produce erroneous information. Instead, when an aligned codon contains any IUPAC character ambiguously representing a set of bases (https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/iupac.html), it is translated into the $X$ (unknown) amino acid, which automatically becomes a variant. Note that queries selecting known amino acids are not affected; unknown amino acids are usually not of interest. Translated amino acid sequences are then aligned with the corresponding amino acid sequences (using NW), annotated with the reference, and amino acid variants are inferred.  

Alignment, variant calling and variant impact algorithms are computationally expensive, so we decided to parallelize this part of the pipeline, taking advantage of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). We implemented a chunked and parametrized execution modality for distributing the analysis of the sequences associated with each virus to multiple machines so that the total execution time of the process can be divided by the number of available machines.

propriate reference sequence (cross-checking with several research papers to ascertain that the typical reference sequence used for variant calling is defined) and the coverage of the sequencing assay. We also compute metrics regarding the percentage of G and C bases, of unknown bases and the information about sequence completeness.  

Some sequences are deposited to multiple sources; we detect such redundancy by matching sequences based on their strain name or the pair of strain name and length. Overlaps among sources is illustrated in Figure 3. As all overlaps occur between GISAID and the other sources, we store the information about overlaps within the GISAID database and allow the possibility of performing ‘GISAID only’ queries, i.e. restricted to GISAID sequences that are not present in GenBank, COG-UK or NMDC.  

# Data curation  

Our first curation contribution is to provide a unique schema (VCM (1)) for different data sources. Metadata of each source use different terms, the mappings between VCM attribute names and those used at the original sources are in Supplementary Tables S2–S5. Specific value curation efforts have been dedicated to the location information, the collection and submission dates, the completion of virus and host taxonomy names/identifiers, the choice of the ap

# Web interface  

The web interface of ViruSurf is composed of four sections, numbered in Figure 4: (1) the menu bar, for accessing services, documentation and query utilities; (2) the search interface over metadata attributes; (3) the search interface over annotations and nucleotide/amino acid variants; (4) the result visualization section, showing resulting sequences with their metadata. Results produced by queries on the search interface (2) are updated to reflect each additional search conditions, and counts of matching sequences are dynamically displayed to help users in assessing if query results match their intents. The interface allows to choose multiple values for each attribute at the same time (these are considered in disjunction); it enables the interplay between the searches performed within parts (2) and (3), thereby allowing to build complex queries given as the logical conjunction––of arbitrary length––of filters set in parts (2) and (3).

Figure 4. Overview of ViruSurf interface. Part 1 (Top bar) allows to reset the previously chosen query or select predefined example queries. Queries are composed by using Part 2 (Metadata search) and Part 3 (Variants search). In our example, Part 2 includes three filters on Virus taxon name, Is complete and $N\%$ . Part 3 includes three panels. Panel $\mathrm{\ddot{A}\dot{}}$ is a query on amino acid variants, selecting sequences with RK and GR changes in gene N; Panel $\mathbf{B}^{\prime}$ is a query on nucleotide variants, selecting sequences with a variant at position 28 881. Panels $\mathrm{\ddot{A}\dot{}}$ and $\mathbf{\cdot}\mathbf{B}^{\prime}$ are closed, they can be removed but not changed. Panel $\mathbf{\nabla}^{\cdot}\mathbf{C}^{\mathbf{\vec{\mu}}}$ is another query on amino acid variants, currently open; it includes two filte s selecting given positions of the Spike protein, and visualizes available values for the original amino acid involved in the change. Part 4 shows the Result Visualization sequences already reflect the filters of Part 2 and the queries of the closed panels ‘A’ plie . Results can be downloaded, r FASTA format; they can be selected as either cases (default) or controls (switch), and both the tide and min ecific protein; table columns can be omitted and reordered. On the bottom right corner, the number of sequences resulting from the search is visualized (in the Figure we show only three sequences out of 14 sequences found).  

Menu bar. The menu bar includes links to the GISAIDspecific ViruSurf system, to the GenoSurf system, and pointers to the data curation detail page, to the wiki, to a video compilation, and to a pedagogical survey supporting the user by documenting the aspects of search queries; on the top right of the interface we provide various ‘Predefined queries’.  

Metadata search. The Metadata search section is organized in four parts: Virus and Host Organism (from the biological dimension), Technology and Organization (from the respective dimensions). It includes attributes which are present in most of the sources, described by an information tab that is opened by clicking on blue circles; values can be selected using drop-down menus. At the side of each value we report the number of items in the repository with that value.  

The user can compose desired queries by entering values from all the drop-down menus; the result is the set of sequences matching all the filters. Note that the special value $\mathrm{{N/D}}$ (Not Defined) indicates the null value, that can also be used for selecting items. For numerical fields (age, length, $G C\%$ and $N\%$ ) the user must specify a range between a minimum and maximum value; in addition, the user can check the $\mathrm{{N/D}}$ flag, thereby including in the result those sequences having the value set to $\mathrm{{N/D}}$ . Similarly, collection date and submission date have a calendar-like drop-down components, supporting a range of dates and the $\mathrm{{N/D}}$ flag.  

Variant search. The Variant search section allows searching sequences based on their nucleotide variants (with their impact) and the amino acid variants. When the user selects ‘ADD CONDITION ON AMINO ACIDS’ or ‘ADD CONDITION ON NUCLEOTIDES’ buttons, a dedicated panel is opened, with a series of drop-down menus for building search conditions. A user can add multiple search conditions within the same panel; these are considered in disjunction. Once the panel is completed, it is registered; registered panels can be then deleted from a query, if needed. Variants selected in different panels are intended in conjuction. Heterogeneous variant searches (i.e. on amino acid and nucleotide ones) can only be combined in panels, thus in conjunction.  

In the example shown in Figure 4 (which represents the construction of the ‘Predefined query 8’, from Pachetti et al. (21)) the user is choosing all SARS-CoV-2 sequences that are complete, have a maximum percentage of unknown bases of $0.5\%$ , and have R to $\mathbf{K}\circ\mathbf{\boldsymbol{\mathrm{{r}}}}\mathbf{G}$ to K amino acid changes in gene $\mathbf{N}$ and a nucleotide variant at position 28 881. The filters set up to this point have selected a set of 14 sequences (as indicated at the bottom right of the page) In the represented snapshot, a third variant panel is in the process of being compiled with an amino acid condition that could be added to the two existing ones by pressing ‘APPLY’. This holds a filter on the spike protein and on the position of the variant on the protein $_{(>1000)}$ ; the filter on original amino acid allows to select P (3 sequences available) or APHG (1 sequence).  

Result visualization and download. The result table describes the sequences resulting from the selections of the user. The columns of the table can be ordered/included/excluded from the visualization; the resulting table can be downloaded for further processing. Whenever the user either adds or removes a value in the  

Metadata search, by clicking on a drop-down menu, the results table is updated; instead, it is updated only when a panel of the Variant search section is complete.  

The ‘Show control’ switch allows to visualize the sequences of the control group, defined by those sequences selected by the Metadata search filters for which there exist some variant and the variant filters are not satisfied. This option, suggested to us by virologists, is the most sensible for describing the effects of variant analysis.  

A user can select from a drop-down menu which subpart of a nucleotide or amino acid sequence should be visualized; the default returns a ‘FULL’ nucleotide sequence (leaving the amino acid field empty), but with this menu option it is possible to return in the result the specific segment of interest. The whole result table––as it is visualized, inclusive of selected metadata and nucleotide or amino acid sequences––can be downloaded for further analysis as a CSV. Alternatively, the user may download either full or selected sequences by using their accession ID, either as CSV or FASTA files.  

GISAID-specific virusurf. ViruSurf presents a version that is specific for data imported from GISAID, as requested by a specific Data Agreement. This interface presents limited functionalities but is nevertheless powerful and allows for combining its results with the ViruSurf main interface. Notable differences are here summarized: (i) after selecting filters, a user must explicitly apply her search by pressing an execution button. (ii) Searches may be performed on the full dataset from GISAID or on the specific subset of sequences that are only present on GISAID (button ‘Apply GISAID specific’)––this may result particularly useful when the user wishes to compare or sum up results from the two interfaces (see Q3 in the following for an example). (iii) Both dropdown menus and the result table’s columns hold the original GISAID attribute name, when available––when this differs from ViruSurf’s, the second one is provided in second position inside parentheses.  

# Example queries  

By means of complex search queries over our database it is possible to help virus research, according to the requirements provided by several domain experts; this is not currently supported by existing systems, which typically offer very nice visual interfaces reporting results of data analysis but limited search capabilities. We cite some examples inspired by recent research works.  

Q1. To support SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design efforts, it is useful to track antigenic diversity. Typically, pathogen genetic diversity is categorized into distinct clades (i.e. a monophyletic group on a phylogenetic tree). In Gudbjartsson et al. (22), specific sequence variants are used to define clades/haplogroups (e.g. the ‘A3 group’ is characterized by the 11083 and 29742 nucleotides G mutated to T, by the 1397 nucleotide G mutated to A, and by the 28 688 nucleotide T mutated to C). ViruSurf supports all the information required to replicate the definition of SARS-CoV-2 clades proposed in the study.  

Q2. In SARS-CoV-2, the G-T transversion at 26 144, which caused an amino acid change in ORF3 protein (G251V), is investigated in Chaw et al. (23). The paper claims that this mutation showed up on 22 January 2020 and rapidly increased its frequency. We can use ViruSurf to find out that GenBank currently provides three complete sequences with such mutation collected before 22 January 2020, while GISAID provides other 13 sequences, nonoverlapping with GenBank ones.  

Q3. A study from Scripps Research, Florida, found that the mutation D614G stabilized the SARS-CoV-2 virus’s spike proteins, which emerge from the viral surface. As a result, the viruses with D614G seem to infect a cell more likely than viruses without that mutation; the G genotype was not present in February and was found with low frequency in March; instead, it increased rapidly from April onward. The scientific manuscript by Zhang et al. (24), cited by mass media (https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/ science/coronavirus-mutation-genetics-spike.html), has not been peer reviewed yet, but others on the same matter are (25)).  

ViruSurf can be used to illustrate this trend. Let us consider two queries on complete sequences. Sequences with the D614G mutation collected before 30 March are 6592, against 4664 without the mutation; sequences with the D614G mutation collected after 1 April are 23 649, against 3331 without the mutation. In both queries, case/control checks are obtained by using the ‘Show control’ switch, which retrieves––for the population specified by metadata filters––sequences that either have or do not have the chosen variants.  

The same queries can be repeated on the GISAIDspecific version of ViruSurf. Sequences with the D614G mutation collected before $30\mathrm{~M~}$ arch are 15 034, against 8821 without the mutation; sequences with the D614G mutation collected after 1 April are 18 421, against 3369 without the mutation. By summing up the query results from the two non-overlapping databases, we obtain that the sequences with the D614G mutation are $61.6\%$ of those collected before 30 March and $86.3\%$ of those collected after 1April.  

Comparison. Note that queries Q1-Q3 could not be performed directly on the native sources. While these provide fairly advanced filters concerning metadata describing sequences, they do not provide in-house computed variants (neither on nucleotides nor on amino acids). Moreover, ViruSurf provides an integration between four sources, with duplicate elimination, thus it provides a good estimate of the sizes of results matching a given query.  

# DISCUSSION  

ViruSurf provides a single point of access to curated and integrated data resources about several Virus species. Example queries show that ViruSurf is able to replicate research results and to monitor how such results are confirmed over time and within different segments of available viral sequences, in a simple and effective way. The relevance of ViruSurf as a tool for assisting the research community will progressively increase with the growth of available sequences and of the knowledge about viruses.  

While today’s efforts are concentrated on SARS-CoV-2, ViruSurf can similarly be useful for studying other virus species, such as other Coronavirus species, the Ebola Virus, the Dengue Virus and MERS-Cov, epidemics which are a current threat to mankind; ViruSurf will also enable faster responses to future threats that could arise from new viruses, informed by the knowledge extracted from existing virus sequences available worldwide.  

In our future work, we plan to add epitopes (amino acid subsequences that can used for designing vaccines, with their lineage, host, evidence and type of response), retrieved from IEDB and stored within new ViruSurf tables, and then searched using suitable Web interface extensions. We also plan to design data analysis services that can provide sophisticated use of our big data collection.

# ABSTRACT  

As the largest ethnic group in the world, the Han Chinese population is nonetheless underrepresented in global efforts to catalogue the genomic variability of natural populations. Here, we developed the PG .Han, a population genome database to serve as the central repository for the genomic data of the Han Chinese Genome Initiative (Phase I). In its current version, the PG .Han archives whole-genome sequences or high-density genome-wide singlenucleotide variants (SNVs) of 114 783 Han Chinese individuals (a.k.a. the Han100K), representing geographical sub-populations covering 33 of the 34 administrative divisions of China, as well as Singapore. The PG .Han provides: (i) an interactive interface for visualization of the fine-scale genetic structure of the Han Chinese population; (ii) genome-wide allele frequencies of hierarchical sub-populations; (iii) ancestry inference for individual samples and controlling population stratification based on nested ancestry informative markers (AIMs) panels; (iv) populationstructure-aware shared control data for genotypephenotype association studies (e.g. GWASs) and (v) a Han-Chinese-specific reference panel for genotype imputation. Computational tools are implemented into the PG .Han, and an online user-friendly interface is provided for data analysis and results visualization. The PG .Han database is freely accessible via http://www.pgghan.org or https://www. hanchinesegenomes.org.  

# INTRODUCTION  

With the continuous development and cost reduction of sequencing technology (1), many large-scale genome sequencing projects have been launched in Western countries to support personalized medicine (PM), such as the UK10K project (2), the Estonian Genome Project (EGP) (3) and the NHLBI Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program (4). Some genomic resources have also been created for a few East Asian populations, including Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese (5–8), but the Han Chinese population has been largely underrepresented. The Han Chinese population is the largest ethnic group in East Asia, and in the world, comprising ${\sim}20\%$ of the global human population, ${\sim}92\%$ of Mainland Chinese, ${\sim}92\%$ of Hongkongers, ${\sim}97\%$ of Taiwanese, $\sim74\%$ of Singaporeans, ${\sim}23.4\%$ of Malaysians and ${\sim}21.4\%$ of the San Francisco’s population (9). Most genetic investigations, however, have focused on in European and African populations. For example, the majority of the genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been predominantly conducted on populations with European ancestry (2,10–13). Reference genomes of natural populations are well-established and have demonstrated their power in disease-mapping studies for populations with  

European ancestry (14), but are still lacking for the Han Chinese population. Some previous studies have also included Han Chinese samples, although either the sample size (15–23) or the geographical coverage was limited (24,25).  

There were recently efforts attempting to analyze shallow $(<2\times)$ or ultra-shallow $(\sim0.05–\bar{0}.1\times\bar{)}$ sequencing data of $100~000$ samples or more collected from resources for other purposes, such as the data that were originally generated for Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT), in which a sufficient number of high-quality variants on an individual level could not be attained, thus limiting their usefulness for population stratification/structure analysis and further association studies (26). The overarching issue in utilizing NIPT whole-genome sequencing data in surveys of genetic variation at the population scale is their sparse and ultrashallow $(\sim0.05\times)$ sequencing coverage at each sample level. In particular, individual genotypes could not be determined on a genome-wide level, making the data roughly equivalent to the deep-sequencing of a few hundred of samples to high coverage $(30\times)$ and thereby limiting their usefulness for population stratification/structure analysis due to the failure to acquire sufficient numbers of high-quality variants on an individual level. For example, it is not feasible to investigate cryptic population structures if individual genotypes cannot be determined on a genome-wide level. In addition, the false positive rate (FPR) of the SNP calling for NIPT data can be very high––as much as $32\%$ , as estimated by a previous study (26).  

Here, we developed a population genomic database specific to the Han Chinese population, namely the PGG.Han, and constructed a reference panel of 114 783 Han Chinese individuals (the Han100K), with whole-genome deepsequenced or high-density genome-wide single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) genotyped or imputed. The PGG.Han has very clear applications/functions in the practice of scientific research; in particular, it provides the first and onlyavailable reference data for (i) a population-structure-aware shared control for genotype–phenotype association studies (e.g. GWASs) and (ii) a Han-Chinese-specific reference panel for genotype imputation. The PGG.Han also provides a variety of online analysis tools, including ancestry inference, genotype imputation, and a routine GWAS pipeline. User-friendly interfaces and online analysis reports greatly facilitate users in the application of genomic data to evolutionary and medical studies of the Han Chinese, as well as East Asian populations.  

# DATA INTEGRATION  

The PGG.Han archives two types of genomic data: wholegenome sequencing data and high-density genotyping data (Figure 1). The whole genomes of ${\sim}12\ 000\ \mathrm{Han}$ Chinese individuals have been sequenced using next-generation sequencing technology and are archived in the $P G G.{\mathrm{Han}}$ , including three deep-sequencing datasets $(\sim30–80\times)$ $\overset{\cdot}{\underset{\cdot}{n}}=$ 319) (16–17,20,22), and two low-pass sequencing datasets $(\sim1.7\times$ , $n=11670$ ; and ${\sim}4\times$ , $n=208$ ) (18,21).  

The deep-sequencing datasets (16,20) represent 28 Han Chinese dialect groups across China. The genomes of $11670$ female Han Chinese were sequenced by the CONVERGE project as a control group for the investigation of major depressive disorders (18). Although in a much lower coverage $(\sim1.7\times)$ , this dataset provides a catalog of 25 057 223 variants for the Han Chinese population and is also included in the $P G G.{\mathrm{Han}}$ .

Figure 1. Sketch map of data integration in the $P G G.{\mathrm{Han}}$ . Using all the whole-genome sequencing data of the Han Chinese samples as a reference panel, the genotype data of 102 586 samples were carefully imputed. The imputation results and the whole-genome sequencing data were further integrated. Strict quality control was applied throughout the process. WGS, whole-genome sequencing.  

The high-density genome-wide SNP data of 102 586 samples were collected from previous GWAS projects, with only non-patient (control) data being retained. Using all the whole-genome sequencing data of the Han Chinese samples as reference data, the genotype data of the 102 586 samples were carefully imputed. We then integrated these data into a dataset and performed strict quality control (Figure 1), including individual filtering and variant filtering. The final dataset contains 8 056 973 genome-wide SNPs shared by all of the 100K Han Chinese samples, of which the geographical origins are known for 56 308 of these samples.  

# DATABASE CONTENT  

# Overview  

The database consists of two major functional modules: (i) visualizing the population structure and querying allele frequencies of subgroups, and (ii) online analysis tools (Figure 2). The population structure follows the visual display mode of $P G G.\mathrm{P}\$ opulation (27), including genetic affinity as measured by $\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{ST}}$ (28), genetic coordinates of populations based on principal component analysis (PCA) (29), and ancestry composition based on ADMIXTURE analysis (30). The presence of population structure can lead to false positive or false negative results in genotype–phenotype association studies (31), but with the help of the PGG.Han data, which contain the fine-scale genetic structure of the Han Chinese population, this effect can be minimized or avoided as much as possible. In order to illuminate the allele frequency information, both tables and interactive maps are provided. It is convenient to query the frequency distribution of each locus in natural populations or in genetic subgroups of the Han Chinese. Since the PGG.Han focuses on the Han Chinese population, we also provide a way to query the allele frequency of each variant in the worldwide population by linking to the PGG.SNV (https://www.pggsnv.org), a sister database of the PGG.Han that provides various information concerning single-nucleotide variants.

Figure 2. Sitemap of the PGG.Han. The database consists of two major functional modules: (i) visualizing the population structure and querying allele frequencies of subgroups (red boxes); (ii) online analysis tools (blue boxes). Each analysis tool can be used independently and combined freely. The red arrow represents the recommended workflow. The imputation step is optional and should be contingent upon the details of the dataset of interest. AF, allele frequency; Ref. allele, reference allele.  

As a significant feature, essential computational functions are embedded in the PGG.Han, including three analysis pipelines, i.e. ancestry inference, genotype imputation and GWAS, with the shared control. It is well known that a population-specific panel or a control dataset is essential for improving the accuracy of imputation or GWAS results (31,32). Accordingly, we designed and recommend the following workflow for analyzing the users’ data (Figure 2). The first step is ancestry inference, which yields the genetic background and subgroup affinity of each individual. For Han Chinese individuals, the ancestry inference is refined to the detailed scale of six genetic subgroups. In the second step, users can select an ancestry-matching reference panel for imputation based on the ancestral inference results. Finally, we provide a population-structure-aware shared control of the Han Chinese for genotype-phenotype association studies. An online GWAS analysis task can be easily be submitted to the analysis platform of the PGG.Han. In addition, each of the three modules can run independently with a great deal of flexibility.  

# Visualization population structure and allele frequencies  

Based on the genetic relationships among provincial populations, six major subgroups have been identified (Supplementary Figure S1): Northwest Han (NWH), Northeast Han (NEH), Central China Han (CCH), Southwest Han (SWH), Southeast Han (SEH) and South Coast Han (SCH). Visualization of the population structure and allele frequency distribution maps are shown from two different perspectives, i.e. provincial populations and genetic subgroups. The interactive page design offers a user-friendly way to acquire information. Overall, the main difference in the Han population is between northern and southern subgroups, consistent with previous observations (9,33–34) (Supplementary Figure S1), with southern subgroups exhibiting greater divergence than northern subgroups.  

The detailed population structures in the form of high-quality SNV data provide researchers with helpful panels for investigating variant allele frequencies within Han Chinese subgroups. For example, ALDH2 is a protein-coding gene involved in the process of alcohol metabolism (35). rs671 is a missense variant on this gene (NP 000681.2: p.Glu504Lys), which decreases enzyme activity and shortens the enzyme half-life (36). This change manifests as acute alcohol sensitivity (OMIM: 610251) and has a high frequency among East Asian ethnic groups. In current public datasets, the only information available is that the frequency of the rs671 missense variant in the Han Chinese from Beijing (CHB) is 0.160 and its frequency in Han Chinese from South China (CHS) is 0.271 (21). The PGG.Han, however, provides more detailed and enlightening information. For example, even populations from Guangdong and Guangxi, which are both southern Han Chinese, have considerably different rs671 missense variant frequencies (Guangdong: 0.291; Guangxi: 0.230). Moreover, not all northern Han Chinese subgroups have lower frequencies than southern Han Chinese subgroups. For example, the frequency of the rs671 missense variant in Gansu is 0.230 and the frequency in Jilin is 0.216, while the frequency in the Yunnan sub-population is 0.191. Therefore, the $P G G.{\mathrm{Han}}$ provides a richer picture of the population stratification and genomic diversity of the Han Chinese population, which is essential for future evolutionary and medical studies.  

# ONLINE ANALYSIS  

# Data upload and quality check  

There are two ways to upload data to the PGG.Han. For small datasets $\mathbf{\zeta}<100\ \mathbf{MB}\mathbf{\zeta}$ , users can upload the data directly on the Web via HTTPS protocol, while FTP is suggested for uploading large datasets. The data uploaded to the server by users are fully protected and accessible to the user only. Users can delete their data at any time from the server. Uploaded data will first be subjected to a quality check. The quality check is a functional module used to determine whether the input data meet the requirements for subsequent data analyses. This module primarily consists of data conversion, summary statistics, and routine data quality control. All data that pass the quality control check can then be used for other analyses.  

# Ancestry inference  

The function of ancestry inference is provided to analyze the genetic ancestry of each individual from different perspectives (Supplementary Figure S2). In order to determine the population affiliation of an individual, we use the hierarchical clustering analysis by representative reference populations based on nested AIMs panels (34). We also quantitatively estimate the proportion of each ancestral component of each individual in the context of global populations. Moreover, proportions of the archaic ancestry are estimated and provided as an independent result using ADMIXTOO LS (30). The haplogroups of mtDNA and/or the Y chromosome of an individual are determined using HaploGrep2 (37,38) as well as our own self-designed algorithm (20), and are displayed on a map with migration routes, which illuminate the possible genetic history of a particular individual. Furthermore, for the Han Chinese samples, we provide more detailed ancestral inference results. For instance, for a given Han Chinese sample, we determine which province is its most likely geographical source. Visual charts are provided for each module.  

# Genotype imputation  

Genotype imputation, or simply imputation in the context of the $\bar{P}G G.\bar{\mathrm{Han}}$ database, is used to estimate the unobserved genotypes and to replace the missing genotypes in a given dataset. Our imputation service is designed to meet three different requests for imputation: (i) achieving the best imputation result for the Han population data with reference panels based on our NGS datasets of Han Chinese; (ii) performing classical imputation tasks with public reference panels of global populations; (iii) estimating and replacing the missing genotypes in the data provided by users. Compared with other imputation services (Supplementary Table S1) (14,39), we provide a few more imputation tools $(39-$ 43) to meet users’ different needs. Various reference panels (14,18–19,21) allow users to optimize the results. Notably, the largest reference panel of the Han Chinese population (the Han100K) is also provided, which we suggest employing for the genotype imputation analysis of samples of Han Chinese or East Asian origin. Output files can be downloaded or directly used for other analyses on our website (Supplementary Figure S3).  

# GWAS  

The genome-wide association study (GWAS) is an approach used to find genetic variations associated with a particular trait or disease by scanning the genome-wide genetic markers (typically SNPs) of many samples. Here, we provide a platform for GWAS analysis, as well as the largest scale of control data for the Han Chinese population (the Han100K Project). Our pipeline includes data quality control procedures (Supplementary Figure S4) and implements two analysis modes, as provided by Plink1.9 (44), i.e. ‘linear’ or ‘logistic,’ which can be identified automatically depending on the data format of the provided phenotypes. Summary statistics of the association analysis for each site are documented in a plain text file, which can be downloaded by users. In addition, a Manhattan plot and an QQ-plot are also provided in each online report (Supplementary Figure S5).  

# FUTURE DIRECTIONS  

In the current version, we have compiled the genome data of $>100000$ Han Chinese samples covering most geographical divisions in China, as well as Singapore. We not only provide detailed information regarding fine-scale genetic structure and allele frequency, but also furnish three online analysis tools, including ancestry inference, genotype imputation, and population-structure-aware control data for GWAS. We expect the $P G G.{\mathrm{Han}}$ to serve as a generally applicable Han Chinese genome reference not only for researchers specifically interested in the Han Chinese population, but also for those in different fields who need to validate their analysis in East Asian populations.  

Overall, as the central repository for the genomic data of the Han Chinese Genome Project (Phase I), the $P G G.{\mathrm{Han}}$ will be a useful database and an efficient platform for the practice of both evolutionary and medical studies of the Han Chinese as well as other East Asian populations.

# ABSTRACT  

BTO, the BRENDA Tissue Ontology (http://www .BTO.brenda-enzymes.org) represents a comprehensive structured encyclopedia of tissue terms. The project started in 2003 to create a connection between the enzyme data collection of the BRENDA enzyme database and a structured network of source tissues and cell types. Currently, BTO contains more than 4600 different anatomical structures, tissues, cell types and cell lines, classified under generic categories corresponding to the rules and formats of the Gene Ontology Consortium and organized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Most of the terms are endowed with comments on their derivation or definitions. The content of the ontology is constantly curated with $\sim1000$ new terms each year. Four different types of relationships between the terms are implemented. A versatile web interface with several search and navigation functionalities allows convenient online access to the BTO and to the enzymes isolated from the tissues. Important areas of applications of the BTO terms are the detection of enzymes in tissues and the provision of a solid basis for text-mining approaches in this field. It is widely used by lab scientists, curators of genomic and biochemical databases and bioinformaticians. The BTO is freely available at http://www.obofoundry.org.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Ontologies which are used in life science represent classification systems that provide a controlled vocabulary for a biological or biomedical knowledge domain. They are flexibly organized to cope with an increasing amount of information in a structured way. The vocabulary items constitute a single common set of terms that enables the use of a formal unified terminology. The terms are connected among each other through well defined relationships. These ‘parent–child’ relationships permit the depiction of the hierarchical structure of the ontology which contains terms at various levels of detail. An important pioneering effort in the field of biological ontologies, probably being the most widely used, is the Gene Ontology (GO) that aims at a standardized functional description of genes and their products (1).  

The BRENDA Tissue Ontology (BTO) (http://www .BTO.brenda-enzymes.org) was initiated in 2003 to develop a standardized representation of all tissue terms from every taxonomic group covering animals, plants, fungi and prokaryotes which are connected to enzyme data in the BRENDA enzyme database (2). The first version was described in brief in a publication on the BRENDA enzyme resource in 2004 (3). The increasing amount of enzyme data and the construction of flexible query options demanded the development of a hierarchical ontology of tissues and cell types representing the sources of enzymes restricted to specific tissues or organs. This vocabulary also includes tissues and organs that are specific to taxonomic groups or single species. Since the development of the Gene Ontology (1,4) as the major collaborative project to standardize the representation and annotation of genes and their products, many biological ontologies have emerged. Most of them are associated with the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies Foundry [OBO, (5)] and are freely available from its website (http://www.obofoundry.org). They include anatomical and developmental ontologies that exclusively focus on various model organisms such as mouse, Drosophila melanogaster or Arabidopsis thaliana. The Cytomer database provides an overview on expression sources such as organs, tissue, cell types and developmental stages, focusing on the human system (6).  

In contrast, the Cell Ontology (7) and the eVOC Ontologies (8) integrate all organisms, but they focus solely on cell types. The Plant Ontology database [PO, (9)] provides a complex hierarchical structure of botanical terms with controlled vocabularies in the annotation of plant-related tissues, growth stage specific expression of genes, proteins and phenotypes. However, it does not support other taxonomic groups such as animals and fungi. Furthermore, the cellular component sub-ontology of GO is restricted to the sub-cellular level and does not extend to multi-cellular structures such as tissues or organs.  

In this article, we describe the BTO as an integrating dictionary for enzymes sources, its content and characteristics, the web interface and the usage of this comprehensive structured encyclopedia of organism-specific tissue terms linked to enzyme functional data. The BTO has been developed according to the rules and formats of the GO Consortium and provides the first ontology for all organisms with respect to the diversity of enzyme sources.  

# STRUCTURE OF THE BTO  

# BTO terms: the nodes of the graph  

All manually extracted enzyme source tissue and organ terms were evaluated and then classified into the hierarchical structure of the ontology. Like the GO, the BTO is organized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose nodes are represented by the BTO terms (Figure 1). The ontology was constructed using the open source Java tool OBO-Edit (formerly known as DAG-Edit), developed by the GO Consortium. Every term (e.g. epithelium) occurs only once in the ontology, hence the entirety of terms is a true set according to the mathematical definition. The terms have definitions and textual descriptions. One or more references lead to the source of information. Each term possesses at least one relationship to another term (see below). As unique identifier each term has a condensed zero-padded seven digit identifier prefixed by ‘BTO:’. These unique identifiers are stored in a relational database (MySQL) and serve as stable accession numbers in order to establish cross references to biochemical databases such as BRENDA.  

# Relationships between the terms: the edges of the graph  

The actual structure of a graph is represented by the relationships between its nodes: the edges. In biological ontologies, the edges describe ‘parent–child’ relationships between the controlled vocabulary terms. For an accurate description of biological ontologies such as the BTO the need for different types of relationships has to be considered in order to correctly dissolve the relationship between the ‘parent’ and ‘child’ terms. Four different types of ‘parent–child’ relationships are defined in the BTO (Figure 2).  

is_a   
e.g. cardiac muscle fibre is_a muscle fibre   
part_of   
e.g. muscle fibre is part_of muscle   
develops_from/derives_from   
e.g. myoma cell develops_from/derives_from muscle   
fibre   
related_to   
e.g. electroplax is related_to muscle fibre  

The relationship type ‘related_to’ was established to describe more general relationships between tissue terms which cannot be defined using the other ones. An example is given by the relationship ‘electroplax’ and ‘muscle fibre’. The term ‘electroplax’ is defined as: ‘A stack of specialized muscle fibres found in electric eels, arranged in series. The fibres have lost the ability to contract, instead they generate extremely high voltages (ca. $500\mathrm{V})$ in response to nervous stimulation. They contain asymmetrically distributed sodium potassium ATPases, acetylcholine receptors and sodium gates at extraordinarily high concentrations’.  

# CONTENT OF THE BTO AND DATA ANNOTATION  

The BTO draws upon the comprehensive enzyme-related data repository of the BRENDA enzyme database, including information on the occurrence of the enzyme source: the anatomical structures, tissues, cell lines, cell types, cancerous tissues from uni- and multi-cellular organisms such as prokaryotes, mammalia, plants, fungi or viruses. Currently, BRENDA contains $\sim75000$ enzyme-organism-specific tissue entries updated twice yearly (BRENDA release 2010.2). These entries were manually extracted from more than 100 000 different literature references. Besides that, terms and concepts from external sources such as UniProt (10), the Experimental Factor Ontology [EFO, (11)], the Foundational Model of Anatomy ontology [FMA, (12)] and the PAZAR Project (13) are integrated into the BTO.  

Since 2003, the number of terms in the BTO increased to 4724 (Figure 3) and the number of all entries, including the synonyms, increased to 8287. The ontology is updated biannually. After each update the data increases by 500–600 different terms.  

The terms are classified into four main categories, which are represented as four separated, non-overlapping subgraphs: animal, plant, fungus and ‘other sources’. For example, the term ‘whole body’, a child term of ‘animal’ has 22 direct child terms (Figure 4). These terms have in total 4142 descendant terms (child terms, grandchild terms, etc.). Furthermore, terms representing cell types are assigned to the tissues from which they originate or to which they are related. Therefore, the term ‘myoma cell’ (a muscular tumour cell) is assigned to the main category ‘animal’ and to the sublevel ‘muscular system’ for example (Figure 5).  

Most of the terms of different organisms are distinguished by the connection of the tissue or cell type to the associated organism information. However, there may be several identical designations for tissues both in plants and animals, e.g. ‘epidermis’. To distinguish between those tissue terms and to assign them correctly into the ontology for plant tissues the prefix ‘plant’ is inserted in front of the term, e.g. ‘plant epidermis’.

Figure 2. Ontology relationships for ‘muscle fibre’ and its descendants, whereas the term ‘muscle fibre’ is a ‘part_of’ a ‘muscle’ (Symbol: P) and a ‘myoma cell’ ‘develops_from’ a ‘muscle fibre’ (Symbol: d). In contrast, the parent–child relationship between ‘muscle fibre’ and ‘electroplax’ is very general represented by the relationship type ‘related_to’ (Symbol: R).  

Additionally, the BTO contains disease-related tissue terms. For example, the term ‘Alzheimer specific cell type’ was introduced to classify the abnormally developed brain tissues in Alzheimer’s disease. This term was assigned as a child to the term ‘cerebral cortex’ with the relationship type ‘related to’. Similarly for epithelioma (a specific type of epithelial cancer) the term ‘epithelioma cell’ classified as ‘derived from epithelial cell’ has been embedded. Another example is ‘cystic fibrosis disease specific cell type’ with the parent term ‘exocrine gland’.  

Since abbreviations are commonly used in the laboratories and subsequently also adopted in the scientific publications, cell line names often consist of short letter–figure combinations, e.g. ‘A6 cell’, ‘L6 cell’ or ‘A-14 cell’. To avoid inconsistencies and ambiguities those terms are renamed within the BTO and described in more detail by checking the original literature reference. For example, ‘A6 cell’ is replaced by ‘Xenopus A6 cell’, ‘L6 cell’ by ‘L6 myoblast cell’ and ‘A-14 cell’ by ‘3T3-A14 cell’. Other short letter combinations such as ‘OEC’ could have multiple meanings, standing for ‘ovarian epithelial cell’, ‘olfactory ensheathing cell’ and also ‘oral epithelial cell’. Therefore, the respective unabridged wording is chosen as the BTO term and ‘OEC’ is included as synonym for all of them.

# Increased annotation efforts in specific emerging fields of research  

The recent focus on specific fields of research in the scientific community, i.e. cancer research, brain research or stem cell research is reflected in an increase in the number of terms in the respective branches of the BTO.  

![](images/e3d3331e7d8cf1e59dc6703d9aae8717d63dc817ac5f6f498e00e08f6fdbec48.jpg)  
Figure 5. The assignment of ‘myoma cell’ in the BTO.  

The major part of recently added BTO terms are newly created cell lines which have been established in many different laboratories. Some of these are also indexed in the large cell line databases such as ATCC—American Cell Type Culture Collection (http://www.atcc.org), ECACC—European Collection of Cell Cultures (http:// www.hpacultures.org.uk/collections/ecacc.jsp) or DSMZ (http://www.dsmz.de). In this manner 96 new melanoma cell lines have been annotated in the last year.  

Enzymes involved in brain function have also gained increased interest of researchers. This is reflected in a growing number of brain-related terms. Currently the BTO contains 218 distinct brain-related terms. These terms encompass various brain areas and are classified according to their anatomical and functional structures. Many general terms have been supplemented with new specific child terms in this context. For example the term ‘neuron’ meanwhile has 34 child terms, 11 of which are neuronal stem cells. These cell types have all been described as enzyme sources.  

# Efforts in finding definitions for terms  

More than $80\%$ of the tissue terms are associated with a definition that concisely describes the meaning and context of the term and are linked to one or more respective references. Whenever available, internationally accepted definitions obtained from medical dictionaries, cell line databases or other expert dictionaries were entered such as Dorlands Medical Dictionary [http:// www.dorlands.com, (14)], NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms (http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary), ATCC, ECACC or Merriam Websters Dictionary [http://www .merriam-webster.com, (15]. Terms without a definition can be found in two categories:  

(i) generic parent terms which do not need a definition, e.g. gastric cancer cell line, as a parent term for various cell lines; and   
(ii) culture condition terms defining a compound which must be present in the culture medium for the

# WEB INTERFACE AND AVAILABILITY  

As part of the BRENDA enzyme database, all entries of the BTO are also stored in a relational database. Several web-based search options are provided to access the entries of the BTO via the BRENDA web site.  

The enzyme sources can be searched via the BRENDA ‘Quick Search’ mode using the Source Tissue search form (see Figure 6, http://www.brenda-enzymes.org/ index.php4?page $=/\mathrm{php},$ /search_result.php $4?a=33$ ) or the ‘Advanced Search’ (http://www.brenda-enzymes.org/ index.php4?page $\c=$ adv_search/index.php4). As a result of a ‘Quick Search’, the user receives a list of all enzymes which are isolated from or detected in the searched BTO tissue. In the next step, the user can directly move on to the BTO website (Figure 1), by clicking on the BTO term or can obtain more detailed information from the comprehensive enzyme result view by clicking on the EC number.  

In addition, there is another versatile web interface (http://www.BTO.brenda-enzymes.org) that offers additional search and navigation functionalities within the BTO (Figure 1). It offers a search for BTO terms, synonyms, definitions or references. A combined search using several of these fields with the boolean operator ‘AND’ is also possible.  

As a result, the graphical representation of the searched term in the form of tree-like subgraph of the BTO is displayed. The frame ‘condensed tree view’ provides an overview of the position of the term of interest in the hierarchical structure of the BTO (Figure 1). Here, the predecessor terms up to the root are shown. Furthermore, the user is enabled to display all direct child terms of the selected term, display the definitions of the terms and easily identify the relationship type between two nodes. Moreover, all enzymes that are related to the selected BTO term are displayed in a selection field. These comprise, for example enzymes that are isolated from the respective tissue or organ. The listed EC numbers are directly connected to the enzyme information of the BRENDA database.  

It is also possible to search for enzymes isolated from a specific BTO tissue, and—if desired—all of its child and related terms using the symbol in the graphical

presentation. For example, the search for ‘forebrain’ alone and with its ramifications yields 35 and 1239 hits, respectively (Figure 7).  

Via the web interface, the BTO can be freely downloaded as a text file from the BRENDA web site (http:// www.brenda-enzymes.org) or in the OBO and OWL format from http://www.obofoundry.org/cgi-bin/detail .cgi?id $\c=$ brenda. The file can be visualized with tools such as OBO-Edit and integrated into a database system for own purposes.  

# USAGE OF THE BTO IN THE COMMUNITY  

The BTO is widely used in the scientific community. Queries in web search engines yield ${\sim}10000$ hits for example. Several secondary databases make use of the BTO. The Tissue DistributionDBs (16) uses the controlled vocabulary terms of the BTO to create an organism-specific repository of tissue distribution profiles for identifying and ranking the genes based on Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs). The PRoteomics IDEntifications database [PRIDE, (17)], the main data repository of proteomics data and also the PAZAR project use the BTO as a reference to define and specify tissues and cell types. The Genes-to-Systems Breast Cancer (G2SBC) database (18), an online resource for molecular and systems biology of breast cancer information also includes the BTO within their project.  

# FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS  

The BTO is currently designed as a human-readable hierarchical vocabulary of enzyme-containing tissues, which is already widely used in biochemical applications. Making it purpose-independent and to include terms that are not connected to enzymes would allow an even larger and wider application and could increase its value for text mining procedures.

# ABSTRACT  

The HemaExplorer (http://servers.binf.ku.dk/hemaexplorer) is a curated database of processed mRNA Gene expression profiles (GEPs) that provides an easy display of gene expression in haematopoietic cells. HemaExplorer contains GEPs derived from mouse/human haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells as well as from more differentiated cell types. Moreover, data from distinct subtypes of human acute myeloid leukemia is included in the database allowing researchers to directly compare gene expression of leukemic cells with those of their closest normal counterpart. Normalization and batch correction lead to full integrity of the data in the database. The HemaExplorer has comprehensive visualization interface that can make it useful as a daily tool for biologists and cancer researchers to assess the expression patterns of genes encountered in research or literature. HemaExplorer is relevant for all research within the fields of leukemia, immunology, cell differentiation and the biology of the haematopoietic system.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Haematopoiesis is the developmental process by which all blood cells are formed. The haematopoietic system is organized in a hierarchical manner with the haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) residing at the apex (Figure 1). HSCs have the ability to self-renew for life and to differentiate into intermediate progenitor cells that subsequently generate the mature cells of the blood stream and immune system (3). Thus, HSCs are ultimately responsible for the constant and life-long generation of intermediate progenitors and terminally differentiated cells. Genetic and epigenetic aberrations may lead to a block in normal haematopoietic differentiation, which may result in the development of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), which is an aggressive blood cancer.  

Given the general interest in haematopoiesis and its associated malignancies such as AML, a number of databases now addresses questions related to these fields, a majority of which is focused on mRNA expression data. There are multiple tools available online that provides a quick overview of the expression of single genes in a selection of tissues as well as some sorted cells. The requirement for purified sorted cell populations in the study of haematopoiesis makes the curation of the database as well as the availability of a reasonable selection of haematopoietic cells important. Examples of general and non-curated databases with focus on representing gene expression based on mRNA microarrays are Gene expression Atlas (GXA) (4), GeneNote (5) and BioGPS (6).  

GXA provides a count table of over and under expression of a query gene in a wide range of cell types and experimental setups, presently counting 3476 experiments of various types. The count numbers are based on differential expression within each microarray dataset in a selection of publicly available microarray data. GeneNote provides a bar chart with a continuous ratio scale axis, displaying expression intensities pre-processed and scaled to a common mean in a global normalization. The database contains a coherent collection of expression profiles in 28 healthy human tissues types. BioGPS provides a summary of single genes including a chart of gene expression based on a single microarray dataset. The variety of cell or tissue types depends on the selected dataset.

Databases dedicated to research in the haematopoietic system and haematopoietic disorders includes Leukemia Gene Atlas (7), BloodExpress (8) and Haematopoietic Fingerprint (9). The Leukemia Gene atlas comprises 20 datasets from Leukemia research experiments; 13 of those sets are gene expression profiles (GEPs). The database provides the possibility of running a number of standardized gene expression analysis methods on a selected dataset, including value sorted bar plots of expression.  

BloodExplorer is a database of 271 microarray-based experiments and provides a list of datasets where a query gene is ‘present’ in terms of a significant $P$ -value and presence on the microarray chip.  

Haematopoietic Fingerprints database contains data from a mouse dataset with 20 samples, and can provide bar charts of gene expression in haematopoietic stem cells and mature populations of erythrocytes, granulocytes, monocytes, NK cells, activated and naive T cells, and B cells. The database also provides an overview of expression across the chromosomes for each cell type.  

The time and expenses necessary for sorting cells drastically reduces the availability of data for investigation of haematopoiesis, as compared to whole tissue samples. This is particularly the case for stem and early progenitor cell populations. None of the present databases integrates and compare GEPs from haematopoietic cells derived from several labs and experiments. Furthermore, there are no publicly available databases with the possibility of visualizing gene expression in a range of sorted cells from both human and murine haematopoietic system, just like a direct comparison with human AML in such a normal context presently will require extensive computational or experimental work form the researcher.  

Here, we present the first publically available fully integrated and curated database of GEPs of sorted cells from stem, progenitor and mature populations important for haematopoietic development in both mouse and human. Compared to the present databases, this method provides a far more complete view of expression in the haematopoietic system. The interface allows for easy visualization of the expression of single genes as well as tools to assess correlation of two genes across multiple cell types. Furthermore the database includes bone marrow from four karyotypic distinct AML subtypes and provides two options for investigating malignant haematopoiesis compared to the normal context.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

The database is built from a curated selection of publicly available datasets containing GEPs from sorted cell populations. The database integrates several Affymetrix platforms (HG-U133A, HG-U133B and HG-U133 Plus 2; Mouse Genome 430 2.0). For the human data the overlapping probes across the platforms populate the database. The mouse database is solely based on the Mouse Genome $430\ 2.0$ platform. Data were separated into batches divided by platform and laboratory. The batches were normalized by robust multi-array average (RMA) using the affy package for R (10) and corrected for batch effects using ComBat (11). Combat is an empirical Bayes (EB) method that: First, standardizes the data by a gene-wise least-square. Secondly, estimates EB batch effect parameters by the method of moments using Gaussian and inverse gamma as prior distributions. Lastly, the data are adjusted using the calculated batch effect estimators. This procedure leaves all data in the database directly comparable between samples within the human and murine part of the database, respectively.  

From the normalized and batch corrected data a new dataset was build containing fold changes between human AML and the closest normal counterpart, as identified by projecting data to a reduced space defined by principle component analysis and deciding Euclidian distance by $k$ -nearest neighbour method. (Rapin et al., manuscript in preparation). The model parameters are constant for the present set of normal sorted cells, and addition of future AMLs will not influence the existing samples.  

In order to handle gene aliases a dictionary of gene aliases was constructed from NCBI {ftp://ftp.ncbi .nlm.nih.gov/gene/DATA/} and The HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) {www.genenames .org}. Ambiguous gene aliases were not included when constructing the dictionary.  

The database structure is a combination of Python pickle and HDF5 files. The main data handling and graphic construction were written in Python NumPy and R called from Python via the rpy2 interface (12). Figure 2 shows a diagram of the database structure and query handling of single gene $(E R G)$ lookup (13).  

The database is continuously updated with new data as it becomes available. The present selection has been focused on including as little batch effect as possible, and thus introducing as few platforms and data sources as possible.  

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  

The HemaExplorer has an easy-to-use interface with a single query field and the possibility to select between several data sources. At present, the database has available: human normal hematopoietic system, human AML, human normal hematopoietic system $^+$ human AML, human AML compared with closest normal counterpart, and mouse haematopoietic system. Cell types and data source are listed in Table 1. The database provides plot of expression for query genes and accepts unambiguous gene aliases. In the case of ambiguous gene aliases a deep link to genecards.org (24) with such a query is constructed on the interface level, to allow the user to identify the relevant gene symbol.  

Currently the interface allows visualization of expression of single genes in haematopoietic cells and any two genes can also be plotted in a pair-wise correlation plot. There is a possibility to include expression in bulk bone marrow of four karyotypes of AML: AML with t(8;21), AML with t(15;17), AML with inv(16)/t(16;16) and AML with t(11q23)/MLL. Furthermore, the interrelationship between these four AML karyotypes can be investigated in a plot displaying their fold change with respect to the closest normal counterpart. In an advanced mode the user can select which of the available haematopoietic cell types to be displayed in the output plot, be it single genes, or two genes for a correlation plot.

The overall integrity of the database is confirmed by dimensionality reduction technique (principle component analysis), as well as correlation analysis of expression profiles by hierarchical clustering, visualized in heatmaps (Supplementary Figure S1 and S2). Both validation techniques show a separation of cell types into well-defined clusters, and reveal no remaining batch effects. The plots are generated using the probe set with the highest mean expression, but normalized expression for all probes annotated to the query gene can be downloaded as a flat file on the result page.  

# Example of correlation plot between two genes  

The possibility of visualizing correlation between two genes makes it possible to identify genes that show similar expression across cell types. Furthermore, this feature enables researchers to visualize characterizing gene pairs with expression patterns that may separate cell populations into distinct clusters and could therefore potentially improve cell sorting strategies.  

In Figure 3, an example of a FACS analysis for murine haematopoietic cells is depicted together with expression correlation plots from HemaExplorer. Gene expression in the correlation plots corresponds to the gene that encodes the surface marker used to gate cell populations in the FACS sorting strategy, performed according to Pronk et al. (1). FACS data and gates in Figure 3A and B represent external biological samples from which there are no expression data in the database, and serves illustrative purposes only.

Grey-shaded cells contain mouse data and non-shaded cells contain human data. Abbreviations are: MY, myelocytes; pbPMN, polymorphonuclear cells from peripheral blood; bmPMN, polymorphonuclear cells from bone marrow; PM, promyelocytes; HSC BM, haematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow; early HPC BM, early haematopoietic progenitor cells from bone marrow; CMP, common myeloid progenitor cells; GMP, granulocyte macrophage progenitor cells; MEP, megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitor cells; $\mathrm{CD4+}$ CD4 positive T-cells; $\mathrm{CD8+}$ , CD8 positive T-cells; mDC, myeloid dendritic cells; pDC, plasmacytoid dendritic cells; CFU-E, colony-forming unit erythroid cells; CLP, common lymphoid progenitor cells; ETP, early thymic progenitor cells; preGM, pre granulocyte monocyte progenitor cells; GMP, granulocyte monocyte progenitor cells; $\mathrm{Ig}\mathrm{M}{+}\mathrm{SP}$ , IgM positive spleen cells; LMPP, lymphoid-primed multipotential progenitor cells; LT-HSC, long-term haematopoietic stem cells; MkE, megakaryocyte erythroid cells; MkP, megakaryocyte precursor cells; NK, natural killer cells; preB, pre-B cells; PreCFU-E, pre-colony-forming unit erythroid cells; ProB, B-cell progenitor cells; ProE, erythroid progenitor cells; ST-HSC, short-term haematopoietic stem cell.  

The comparison between a FACS sorting strategy and the expression correlation plots from HemaExplorer shows similar clustering of cell types.  

# Example of single gene lookup  

In Figure 3E, a single gene lookup for BMI-1 is depicted. The BMI-1 gene is known for its role in proliferation, senescence and self-renewal under various conditions (25–27). The expression plot for BMI-1 shows high expression for immature cells, gradually decreasing for cell types found in later stages of the myeloid haematopoietic differentiation pathway. BMI-1 expression in the four AML karyotypes included in the database has levels comparable to the more immature stages, suggesting that the bulk of cells in leukemic bone marrow tends to be less mature and expresses more stem-like phenotype.  

# Example of comparison between human AML and the closest normal counterpart  

In Figure 3F, a single gene lookup is depicted for the query gene VEGFA (vascular endothelial growth factor A). The plot shows the fold change between the AML and the closest normal counterpart. The plot shows clear difference in mRNA expression of VEGFA between the two groups: AML with t(8;21) (AMLI_ETO) and AML with t(15;17) (APL) on one side and AML with inv(16)/ t(16;16) and AML with t(11q23)/MLL on the other side. This, and similar distinct separations of AML karyotypes when they are compared to their closest healthy counterpart, can provide researchers with valuable research targets then investigating differences between gene expression in discrete AML subtypes relative to normal cells.  

In conclusion, the HemaExplorer is a curated normalized and batch corrected database of GEPs in normal and malignant haematopoiesis in human and mouse. The easy-to-use interface allows for an easy lookup of the expression levels of a gene and for the correlation of expression between pairs of genes. Full integration and comparability of data collected from several sources extents the scope, and possible overview of single mRNA expression in haematopoiesis, compared to the present public available databases. Moreover, the HemaExplorer contains four karyotypes of human AML that can be put in context of the normal haematopoietic system, when visualizing gene expression. Therefore, HemaExplorer will be of use to researchers within the fields of leukemia, immunology, cell differentiation and the biology of the haematopoietic system as a powerful easy-accessible tool for the assessment of gene expression.

# ABSTRACT  

The toxic effects of compounds on environment, humans, and other organisms have been a major focus of many research areas, including drug discovery and ecological research. Identifying the potential toxicity in the early stage of compound/drug discovery is critical. The rapid development of computational methods for evaluating various toxicity categories has increased the need for comprehensive and system-level collection of toxicological data, associated attributes, and benchmarks. To contribute toward this goal, we proposed TOXRIC (https://toxric. bioinforai.tech/), a database with comprehensive toxicological data, standardized attribute data, practical benchmarks, informative visualization of molecular representations, and an intuitive function interface. The data stored in TOXRIC contains 113 372 compounds, 13 toxicity categories, 1474 toxicity endpoints covering n vivo/in vitro endpoints and 39 feature types, covering structural, target, transcriptome, metabolic data, and other descriptors. All the curated datasets of endpoints and features can be retrieved, downloaded and directly used as output or input to Machine Learning (ML)-based prediction models. In addition to serving as a data repository, TOXRIC also provides visualization of benchmarks and molecular representations for all endpoint datasets. Based on these results, researchers can better understand and select optimal feature types, molecular representations, and baseline algorithms for each endpoint prediction task. We believe that the rich information on compound toxicology, ML-ready datasets, benchmarks and molecular representation distribution can greatly facilitate toxicological investigations, interpretation of toxicological mechanisms, compound/drug discovery and the development of computational methods.

# INTRODUCTION  

Identifying the toxicity of compounds is necessary to explore their harmful effects on humans, animals, plants, and the environment (1). The toxic effects are classified into various toxicity categories, including carcinogenicity, hepatotoxicity, ecotoxicity, irritation and corrosion. The toxicity evaluation of compounds plays an important role in many areas of research. For example, during drug discovery and development, unexpected toxicities are the most significant reasons for hindering drug candidates from reaching the market (2–4). Many marketed drugs have even been withdrawn due to toxicity concerns. Potential toxicities should be extensively evaluated in the early stage of drug development (4). In ecotoxicity testing, the toxic effect of a compound is measured on both environment and organisms, such as fish, insects, microorganisms, wildlife, and plants (5,6). Elucidating the potential ecotoxicity in exploration of materials is critical.  

In order to identify the toxicities of compounds, many evaluation approaches have been developed, including conventional in vivo, in vitro, and computational methods. Due to the advantages of low cost, fast speed, and high accuracy, computational methods based on a large amount of toxicological data have been widely explored, including rule-based models (7), read-across (8), QSAR (Quantitative structure-activity relationship) (9) and Machine Learning (ML)-based methods (1,10). More importantly, toxicity evaluation results can be presented before the synthesis of compounds with computational methods (4,11).  

However, the major challenge in developing computational methods is the low accessibility of sufficient, reliable, and standardized toxicological and related attribute data (3,4). Despite an abundance of online databases providing access to large amounts of toxicology data (12–16), there is an increasing demand for high-quality and ML-ready toxicology, attribute datasets and benchmarks. We classified the existing online toxicological databases into four categories, toxicity category-centric, toxic feature-centric, compoundcentric and ML task-centric. The toxicity category-centric and toxic feature-centric databases focus on specific toxicity categories/endpoints or toxic-related feature data (toxicogenomic data, etc.). The compound-centric databases provide multiple toxicological information, while most of them serve only to retrieve multiple toxicities and chemical information of compounds, or the downloadable toxicity datasets are not curated in ML-ready format. For toxicity evaluation, it is necessary to integrate and curate data of multiple toxicity categories and feature spaces. In addition, depending on different toxicity categories, different computational methods may apply. Methods applicable to certain types of toxicity endpoints may not work properly (or not work at all) for others (1). The benchmarks also have a critical role in facilitating progress in ML methods. According to the benchmark results, researchers can select an appropriate feature type and baseline model for different prediction task. There have been two ML task-centric databases that provide benchmarks for ML, Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) (17) and MoleculeNet (18) databases, which are platforms to provide datasets, ML tasks, benchmarks, and other information for various fields of study, such as drug combination and biophysical-related studies. Neither is a database directly focused on toxicology, nor does it provide data retrieval. Thus, there is an urgent need for a database to retrieve comprehensive toxicology, attribute data and system-level benchmarks (19–21).  

To address this issue, we propose TOXRIC (TOXicology Resources for Intelligent Computation) database (https://toxric.bioinforai.tech/), which aims to collect, curate, and disseminate comprehensive, reliable, and standardized datasets of toxicity categories and feature types. The data stored in TOXRIC contains 113,372 compounds, 13 toxicity categories, 1,474 toxicity endpoints covering in vivo/in vitro endpoints, 6 feature spaces and 39 feature types, covering structural, target, transcriptome, metabolic data, and other descriptors. The toxicity values and features of each compound can be quickly retrieved and downloaded. All the curated datasets of endpoint and feature type can be downloaded and used directly as output or input to ML models for toxicity prediction. TOXRIC also provides multiple benchmark results and spatial distribution of molecular representations for all toxicity endpoints. Based on these visualization results, researchers can better understand and select appropriate feature types, molecular representations, and baseline algorithms for each toxicity endpoint prediction task. TOXRIC offers an effective and user-friendly web interface to take full advantages of the wealthy data and available information. The detailed description of datasets, rapid search/batch search of toxicological data, download of the information on individual compound or datasets, visualization of benchmark results and molecular representations are freely available to all users through the TOXRIC web.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Data collection and curation  

TOXRIC provides toxicological data, feature, and chemical data for each compound. The chemical data include six commonly used identifier types and several physicochemical properties. Toxicological data provide toxicity values on multiple toxicity endpoints, which can be used as the label data for ML models. The feature data provide representations of compounds, which can be taken as input to ML models.  

Curation process of toxicological and chemical data. TOXRIC collects four toxicology groups, 13 toxicity categories and 1474 endpoint datasets across ${>}15$ species. The four groups include toxic effect, target organ toxicology, applied toxicology, and other toxicology datasets. According to the groups, relevant literatures and publicly available databases are retrieved. The main sources include ToxCast/Tox21 (22,23), LTKB (24), DILIrank (16), Livertox (25), ChemIDplus (26) database, and studies by Jain et al. (10), Wu et al. (3), Jiang et al. (27), etc. All the sources are commonly used for toxicity prediction (28–33). In addition, the 13 categories contain both in vitro and in vivo toxicity endpoints. Among them, Acute Toxicity and Ecotoxicity contain the in vivo endpoints across different species under specific exposure times and doses. Hepatotoxicity, Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity, Carcinogenicity, Respiratory Toxicity, and Clinical Toxicity are in vivo endpoints without specific exposure conditions. ToxCast&Tox21 Assay, CYP450, Cardiotoxicity and Endocrine Disruption are based on in vitro cytotoxicity assays under specific exposure conditions (34).  

The curation process of toxicology data consists of three parts: compound screening, data source integration, and unit standardization. First, the compounds of all data sources are extracted, which is usually represented by different identifiers. The identifiers are matched to PubChem CID and Canonical SMILES. Duplicate compounds are removed according to Canonical SMILES. Then, salts and solvents are removed, followed by counterions, large organic compounds $\mathrm{(Da}\geq2000\$ ), mixtures, and inorganic compounds. This is implemented in accordance with a protocol previously developed by Jain et al. (10) and Jiang et al. (27). To distinguish the salts, compounds containing metal atoms and involved in the USAN Council’s list of pharmacological salts (https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/ 2019-04/radicals-and-anions-list.pdf) are removed, following the protocol developed by Bento et al. (35). Next, a unique identifier, TAID, is assigned for each compound in TOXRIC. Relevant chemical information of compounds is integrated into the database. In addition, the endpoint datasets with $<10$ samples are removed.  

Second, in order to avoid compatibility issue, the toxicity values for all endpoints except hepatotoxicity are collected from a single reliable source. Hepatotoxicity induced by compounds is a significant problem in toxicology. To expand the amount of hepatotoxicity data, we collect toxicity values from seven sources, including LTKB database, DILIrank database, Livertox database, and four literatures (28,36–38). For compounds with inconsistent toxicity values from multiple sources, the true result can only be determined when more than $80\%$ of the sources belong to the same toxicity value. Otherwise, the toxicity of the compound is considered ambiguous, and the compound will be removed.  

Third, the datasets provided in TOXRIC include classification and regression datasets. Toxicity values in classification datasets are binary values of 0 or 1 with no units, indicating toxic or non-toxic class. Toxicity values in regression datasets (Acute Toxicity and Ecotoxicity) are quantitative results, containing LD50, LDLo, TDLo, LC50, etc. Datasets from different sources use different units, including $\mathrm{(mg/kg)}$ , $\mathrm{(gm/kg)}$ , $(\mathrm{ug/kg})$ , $(\mathrm{ng/kg})$ , $\mathrm{(uL/kg)}$ , $\mathrm{(mL/kg)}$ and $\mathrm{(mg/L)}$ . The units of the endpoints tested in some typical species are listed in Supplementary Table S1. We standardized the units in two steps. First, all the units are converted to $\mathrm{(mg/kg)}$ for Acute Toxicity or $\mathrm{(mg/L)}$ for Ecotoxicity to get version-1 of both datasets. The curated data of Ecotoxicity is in $\mathrm{(mg/L)}$ ) unit. Then, the formula for converting other units to $\mathrm{(mg/kg)}$ is as follows.  

$$
{\begin{array}{r l}&{1\left(\mathrm{{mg}/{k g}}\right)=10^{-3}\left(\mathrm{{g}/{k g}}\right)=10^{6}\left(\mathrm{{ug}/{k g}}\right)}\\ &{\qquad=10^{9}\left(\mathrm{{ng}/{k g}}\right)}\end{array}}
$$  

$$
1\left(\mathrm{L}/\mathrm{kg}\right)=10^{3}\left(\mathrm{mL}/\mathrm{kg}\right)=10^{6}\left(\mathrm{uL}/\mathrm{kg}\right)
$$  

$$
\mathrm{TV}\left(\mathrm{mg/kg}\right)=\frac{\mathrm{VC}\left(\mathrm{L/kg}\right)}{\mathrm{MV}}\times\mathrm{MW}\times10^{3}
$$  

The units of $\mathrm{(gm/kg)}$ , $(\mathrm{ug/kg})$ and $(\mathrm{ng/kg})$ are converted to $\mathrm{(mg/kg)}$ through Eq. (1). The units of $\mathrm{(uL/kg)}$ and $\mathrm{(mL/kg)}$ are converted to $\mathrm{(L/kg)}$ through Eq. (2), and then $\mathrm{(L/kg)}$ is convert to $\mathrm{(mg/kg)}$ through Eq. (3). In Eq. (3), TV stands for toxicity value, VC stands for volume concentration, MV stands for molar volume, MW stands for molecular weight. MV and MW of compounds are obtained from PubChem using the Python PubChemPy package (https://pubchempy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Second, to facilitate the development of ML prediction models, the dimensionless values are introduced. The units are standardized into $(-\mathrm{log}(\mathrm{mol}/\mathrm{kg}))$ or $\mathrm{(-log(mg/L))}$ to get the dimensionless values (32). Then the version-2 of the datasets with dimensionless values can be obtained. On TOXRIC website, version-1 of regression datasets with toxicity values in $\mathrm{(mg/kg)}$ or $\mathrm{(mg/L)}$ unit is provided for retrieval, and both version-1 and version-2 are available for download.  

Curation process of feature data. Multiple feature types of these compounds are computed and curated, including seven molecular fingerprints, target protein, three transcriptome profiles, metabolic reaction, two categories of drugs, and 25 descriptors collected from the Chemical Checker (CC) database (39). Seven common molecular fingerprints are computed by RDKit to represent the structure of compounds. Target proteins of compounds are collected from DrugBank (40) and BindingDB (41) database in text format. Category information are collected from DrugBank database. The 328 192 reaction equations of 9598 compounds are obtained from NICEdrug.ch (42), a database for systems-level analysis of drug metabolism. The InchIKey identifier is used to match the compounds between TOXRIC and NICEdrug.ch.  

The transcriptome profiles are collected from three data sources, LINCS L1000 (43), Open TG-GATEs (44) and DrugMatrix (45) databases. Data from the LINCS L1000 database contains the expression levels of 978 landmark genes under compound perturbations (not covering the complete transcriptome). In LINCS database, the expression profiles are measured by the L1000 method, which contains only 1058 probes for 978 landmark transcripts and 80 control transcripts. The remainder of the transcriptome is inferred using the landmark transcript measurements, and $81\%$ of the inference is accurate according to the study by Subramanian et al (43). Level 5 data is obtained from the LINCS L1000 database, including the gene expression with multiple doses and times. A unique transcriptional profile of each compound is obtained using the moderated $z$ -score (MODZ) approach, and the $z$ -scores are weighted and averaged according to Spearman correlations. Transcriptional profiles of compounds in primary human hepatocytes (in vitro) and rat kidney and liver organs (in vivo) are collected and curated from the Open TG-Gates database. DrugMatrix (45,46) is produced by the U.S. National Toxicology Program, containing transcriptomic profiles of more than 200 compounds tested in vivo in rat tissues such as liver and 125 compounds in the in vitro rat hepatocytes. The microarray data is obtained from GEO. In the microarray data, the gene symbols are converted to EntrezID through the annotation file, and the original probes are batch normalized by RMA using R package affy (47). The expression matrix is obtained by averaging the duplicate probe and duplicate gene. The missing values are filled using interpolation. Differential expression results are then calculated. Finally, data of different doses and exposure times are weighted averaged.  

In addition, 25 features are collected from CC database (39). Different from other original features, the feature vectors provided by CC are 128-dimensional embedding processed by the node2vec algorithm. Among the CC descriptors, the 2D fingerprint is involved, which is different from the seven fingerprints provided by TOXRIC. The latter is the original feature of molecular structure, and each bit represents the presence or absence of a particular substructure. In contrast, the CC descriptors provide feature embedding, which transform features from the original space into a new low-dimensional space. Every dimension has no actual meaning. And the missing values of the original feature are filled by the similarity principle.  

# Benchmark construction  

TOXRIC provides ML tasks and benchmarks for all the endpoint datasets. The ML tasks include classification and regression tasks. Tested on these tasks, TOXRIC provides two benchmarks on 36 feature types and four typical ML algorithms on all endpoint datasets.  

The endpoint datasets can be used as label data for ML models, while the feature datasets can be used as input. Four typical ML algorithms widely used for toxicity prediction are evaluated (48), including eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) (49), Random Forest (RF) (50), Support Vector Machine (SVM) (51) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) (10). XGB and RF are two advanced ensemble learning algorithms, which are representative of sequential ensemble and parallel ensemble, respectively. Both algorithms have performed well in small to medium datasets. SVM constructs a hyperplane or a set of hyperplanes to classify data points and is effective in high-dimensional spaces. DNNs consist of several sequential hidden layers, and have been reported to outperform most other ML methods in predicting molecular properties in large-scale datasets. In contrast, in most small or medium datasets, classical ML methods perform better than DNN with less hyperparameter tuning (52). In the benchmark construction of TOXRIC, XGB, RF and SVM are implemented in scikit-learn or XGB python module with the default configuration. DNN model is followed by Jain et al (10).  

To evaluate the performance of benchmarks, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), $\mathbf{R}^{2}$ or F1 metrics are computed according to five-fold cross-validation. The mean and standard deviation are reported. RMSE reflects the average error between the predicted values and the ground-truth labels. Lower RMSE and higher $R^{2}$ value represents higher prediction performance in regression datasets. As most of the endpoint datasets are imbalanced, $F1$ metric is chosen to evaluate the performance in classification tasks. The higher the $F1$ value, the higher the prediction performance.  

TOXRIC provides two types of benchmarks. For the benchmarks on feature types, 36 features are tested using XGB algorithm. Among them, target proteins are encoded as one-hot-encoded vectors. In the training datasets of different feature types, samples with missing features are removed. And the endpoint datasets with the sample numbers $<10$ are removed. For the benchmarks on different algorithms, four algorithms with the same input are tested. According to the benchmark results of feature types, two fingerprints (PubChem fingerprint and RDKit2D descriptor) provided the highest average prediction performance. Taking the concatenation of these two types of fingerprints as input data, the performance results of XGB, RF, SVM and DNN algorithms are evaluated.  

# Molecular representation evaluation  

TOXRIC visually shows the spatial distribution of multiple molecular representations on the classification tasks. Representations in multiple spaces are explored, including seven original molecular fingerprints, target protein, three transcriptome profiles and three ML-based feature embedding. The ML-based feature embedding refer to the representations after representation learning or feature selection by three ML models, i.e. XGB, RF, and DNN. The representation of XGB and RF model is based on feature selection. The top 100 important features are extracted through feature importance values provided by scikit-learn library (53). The DNN-based feature embedding is an internal representation extracted from the output of the last hidden layer of the above trained DNN. The t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) algorithm is applied to generate and visualize the two-dimensional embeddings of the representations. A scatter plot can intuitively show the clustering effect of each representation on the toxic or non-toxic classes.  

# Online database implementation  

TOXRIC is built with a separated frontend and backend framework. The backend is implemented using the Springboot framework, and the frontend uses VUE framework. NGINX is used as a reverse proxy, enabling strong performance at scale. All the data are stored and managed using MySQL, and Elasticsearch is deployed as the search engine. Elasticsearch is a distributed, highly scalable, high real-time search and analysis engine. It can quickly search and analyze large amounts of data due to the advantage of the horizontal scalability. All the online data visualizations, including the bar charts and pie charts of statistics and benchmark results, are supported by ECharts 4.0 (54), an opensourced JavaScript library for the rapid construction of interactive visualization. Software development tools include Python 3.8.5, PubChemPy 1.0.4, RDKit 2022.03.2, scikitlearn 0.24.2 (53), xgboost 1.4.2, and tensorflow 2.5.0. The website has been tested thoroughly to ensure functionality across multiple operating systems and web browsers.  

# DATABASE CONTENT AND USAGE  

# Data summary and analysis  

The latest release of TOXRIC contains and catalogs toxicology information on 113 372 compounds, 13 toxicity categories and 1474 toxicity endpoints of more than 15 species. In addition, 39 feature types of these compounds are computed or curated. Importantly, all the datasets stored in TOXRIC are ML-ready and can be used directly as input or output to ML models.  

The 13 toxicity categories contain a different number of endpoints (Figure 1A). ToxCast&Tox21 Assay contains the largest number of endpoints (1381 endpoints), followed by Acute Toxicity (59 endpoints) and Endocrine Disruption (12 endpoints), while other toxicity categories contain less than 5 endpoints. The number of compounds in each toxicity category is counted (Figure 1B). Acute Toxicity contains the largest number of compounds (79 725 compounds), accounting for $59.68\%$ of all compounds, followed by CYP450 (16 280 compounds), accounting for $12.19\%$ . Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity contains the least number of compounds (218 compounds), accounting for $0.16\%$ . As shown in Figure 1C, each compound has multiple endpoint results (label data). Statistical results show that 10 668 compounds have only one endpoint, while 345 compounds have more than 180 endpoint results, which are distributed in Acute Toxicity and ToxCast&Tox21 Assay datasets.  

In the feature space, TOXRIC collects and calculates six feature spaces related to toxicity prediction, including molecular fingerprint, target protein, category of drug, transcriptome profile, metabolic reaction, and CC descriptor. For compounds, structural data is always available, while transcriptome data is scarce, covering only 2587 compounds, as shown in Figure 1D. Features of molecular fingerprints, transcriptome profiles, and CC descriptors are in a common vector format. The length of the feature vectors is between 128 (CC descriptor) and 15 406 (transcriptome profile in Open TG-GATEs) components. Among the features, RDKit2D descriptor, three transcriptome profiles and $25~\mathrm{CC}$ descriptors consist of continuous values, while other features are composed of binary discrete values. More statistical results are shown on Statistics page on TOXRIC website.  

# Web design and interface  

TOXRIC offers an effective and user-friendly web interface to take full advantage of the wealthy data, benchmarks and molecular representation distribution. Users can query the toxicological data, features, and chemical information of compounds in the search box of the Home page or on the Search page. The Data Collection page provides an overview of the toxicological and feature datasets, and the Statistics page shows the statistical results of the datasets. The Benchmark&Representation page displays visualization of benchmarks and molecular representation distribution. The Download page provides links to download data of all the endpoint and feature type datasets. Users can contribute their toxicology data on Contribute page. A detailed step-by-step tutorial of TOXRIC (Supplementary  

Data) and contact information is readily accessible on the Contact&About page.  

Data browsing. On the Home page, the number of datasets of both toxicity categories and feature spaces is displayed in the form of two-layer concentric circles. The inner layer and outer layer represent toxicity category and feature space respectively. When clicking on the dataset field, users will be linked to the corresponding dataset description on the Data Collection page.  

On the Data Collection page, three types of entries can be browsed, i.e. toxicity category, feature space and external database links. The basic information of the toxicity category dataset, toxicity endpoint, and feature type dataset is provided, including dataset description, number of compounds, sources and feature dimension. The interactive filter located on the left side of the pages allows users to explore the endpoint and feature type datasets. Users can click the details button to query the detailed information of the selected datasets. On the detail information page, all compounds contained in a dataset are listed in the form of a molecular graph (Figure 2A). Clicking on a specific compound will open the compound information page that displays affluent chemical, toxicological, and feature data of the compound.  

The Statistics page describes some statistical results of datasets provided by TOXRIC in pie and bar charts, including the number of compounds for the toxicity categories and feature datasets, the number of endpoints/types for toxicity categories and feature spaces, and the number of compounds with multiple labels and features.  

Data retrieval. The toxicological information of compounds can be quickly searched in the search box of the Home page or on the Search page. The search box accepts both complete or partial keywords of TAID, name, IUPAC name, PubChem CID, SMILES, InChIKey and InChI identifiers. Fuzzy search is allowed. If the typed terms can match multiple compound entities in the database, a list of suitable suggestions will be provided. The query keyword is highlighted in red. In addition to searching for individual compound, TOXRIC also provides a batch search for a list of compounds on the Search page. After selecting an identifier, users can enter a compound list or upload an EXCEL or TXT file to query the information of the compounds.  

The compound information page consists of three sections, i.e. chemical information, toxicity category, and feature space. The chemical information section provides seven commonly used identifier types and physicochemical properties of compounds (Figure 2B). In the toxicity category section, a list of toxicity values of 13 toxicity categories is provided in tabular format (Figure 2C). Users can view the toxicity values of various endpoints by selecting a toxicity category. Below is a list of feature spaces (Figure 2D). The targets, categories, and metabolic reactions of compounds are listed in text format to be queried, while the feature vectors of transcriptome profiles, molecular fingerprints, and CC descriptors should be downloaded to use because the length of the vectors is too long to display. Users can download the toxicity endpoints or feature types of a compound by clicking on the download button in the upper-right corner. Below the feature list, the top 10 GOBP (Gene Ontology Biological Process) and KEGG pathway enrichment results of compounds’ target proteins are displayed in a bubble plot (Figure 2E).

(C) The number of compounds with multiple toxicity endpoints. (D) The number of compounds for feature spaces. More statistical results are shown on Statistics page on TOXRIC web.  

Benchmark and representation distribution display. The Benchmark&Representation page displays visualization of two types of benchmarks and a molecular representation distribution. On the Benchmarks for Feature Types page, the bar charts intuitively show the predictive effect of 36 feature types on all toxicity endpoints (Figure 2F). The feature types include seven molecular fingerprints, a target, three transcriptome profiles, and $25\ \mathrm{CC}$ descriptors. The mean and standard deviation are showed when the mouse is suspended on the bar. In classification datasets, $F1$ metric is used to evaluate the performance of features. For regression datasets (Acute Toxicity and Ecotoxicity), users can select RMSE or $R^{2}$ metric to view the results by clicking the buttons above the bar chart. Lower RMSE value or higher $R^{2}/F1$ value represent higher prediction performance. It should be noted that if the value of metric is 0, it represents the number of samples with the feature type at the endpoint dataset is $<10$ and no benchmark experiment is performed. Click on a bar or the title of an endpoint, the corresponding feature or endpoint dataset on the Download page will open in a new tab. In addition, users can enter the keywords of required endpoint and feature in the search box at the top right corner to search.  

The Benchmarks for Algorithms page shows the benchmark results of four typical algorithms on all toxicity endpoints, i.e. XGB, RF, SVM, and DNN (Figure 2G). Each picture shows 10 endpoints, slide the mouse on the bar chart and drag the scroll bar below the chart to view the results of 10 endpoints. The mean and standard deviation are shown when the mouse is suspended on the bar.  

The T-SNE Embedding of Molecular Representations page shows the clustering effects of multiple representations in scatter plots on the classification endpoint datasets (Figure 2H). The representations include 11 original features and three ML-based representations. The original features are seven molecular fingerprints, a target, and three transcriptome profiles. The ML-based representations refer to vectors after representation learning or feature selection by three typical ML models, i.e. DNN, RF, and XGB.  

Downloads. All toxicological and feature data can be downloaded from the website without login or registration. Datasets of different endpoints and feature types can be downloaded separately.  

Contribute. In order for the TOXRIC to continue to grow and expand, we rely on the community to help us through contributions. Users can contribute toxicology data to TOXRIC by uploading data in the contribute box on Contribute page or contacting us.

# CASE STUDY  

# Example application  

This section describes how to use TOXRIC for toxicity prediction using the mouse intraperitoneal LD50 dataset (Acute Toxicity category) as an example (Figure 3). First, this endpoint dataset can be downloaded on the Download page as the label data (Figure 3A). By searching the benchmarks of feature types on the Benchmark&Representation page, it is found that the MACCS molecular fingerprint achieves the best performance (RMSE metric) on this endpoint (Figure 3B). Then, the MACCS fingerprint dataset can be downloaded as the input feature (Figure 3C). The input and output datasets are ready for toxicity prediction. By searching the benchmarks of algorithms, the RF algorithm achieves the best performance (RMSE metric) on this endpoint (Figure 3D). Therefore, in this dataset, RF can be considered as the baseline for the development of new ML algorithms. A step-by-step example application for toxicity prediction is provided on Supplementary data and Contact&About page of TOXRIC website. In addition, considering potential relationships between different toxicity endpoints, the TOXRIC database can be fully utilized to explore multitask learning (MTL) and transfer learning (TL) methods (3).  

# Analysis of benchmark results  

For computational prediction, it is of vital importance to select an appropriate feature type and baseline model according to the benchmark results. TOXRIC provides two types of benchmarks for all endpoints, i.e. benchmarks for feature types and typical algorithms. Taking the regression dataset as an example, we compare and analyze the performance of different feature types. We average the RMSE values on all regression datasets for each feature type. Molecular fingerprints show significant performance advantages over other features. Among them, RDKit2D descriptor has the best performance (0.8596), and ECFP6 fingerprint has the worst performance (0.9104). However, in the mammal (species unspecified) subcutaneous LD50 dataset, ECFP6 has the best performance, which is $9.55\%$ higher than RDKit2D. It is observed that there is no optimal feature type that performs best in all endpoints. In most cases, the RDKit2D descriptor and PubChem fingerprint can achieve better performance. Researchers should select appropriate feature types for different endpoints according to the benchmark results. Next, the benchmark results of the four algorithms (XGB, RF, SVM, DNN) are analyzed. In terms of the average $F1$ and RMSE values for all datasets, XGB achieves the best average $F1$ value and RF achieves the best average RMSE value. SVM has the lowest average $F1$ value and DNN get the worst regression performance. But in some specific datasets, SVM or DNN can get the best performance. For example, in the Endocrine Disruption category, the $F1$ value of DNN in the NA-AR endpoint is 0.529, which is $8.78\%$ worse than the RF (0.616). While in the SRARE endpoint, the performance of DNN is the best (0.514), outperforming RF by $9.60\%$ (0.371). Thus, the optimal feature types or baseline models are different in different endpoints. Researchers should select appropriate feature type or baseline model at each endpoint according to the benchmarks provided by TOXRIC.  

Benchmark results can also verify the quality of training dataset from an applied perspective. For example, we average the performance results on seven molecular fingerprints for each endpoint dataset. In classification datasets, the average $F1$ values under two categories (Irritation and Corrosion, Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity) exceeds 0.89, indicating the quality of training dataset. Except for the ToxCast&Tox21 Assay, 21 of 30 endpoints have average $F1$ values over 0.5. In ToxCast&Tox21 Assay, 1110 of 1381 endpoints have average $F1$ values $<0.5$ , which may be due to the small-sized and class-imbalanced characteristics. There are 514 endpoints with an imbalance rate ${>}9{:}1$ , and even 148 endpoints with an imbalance rate ${>}50{:}1$ . The datasets with poor benchmark results are also provided in TOXRIC. This may motivate researchers to develop new prediction methods to solve the problem of small-sized and class-imbalanced datasets, which are significant issues in computational toxicology communities.  

# Characteristics of molecular representations  

In addition to the two types of benchmarks, TOXRIC also displays the spatial distribution of multiple molecular representations on the Benchmark&Representation page. The features of structural, target, transcriptome profile and MLbased representation are projected to two dimensions in scatter plots by the t-SNE algorithm. Compared to the representations trained by ML models, the original features can hardly show the clustering effect on all the classification tasks. There is a lot of overlap between clusters, indicating that the features cannot well distinguish the classes. However, for the ML-based feature spaces especially DNNbased embedding, there is a clear separation of the two classes in all tasks. After mapping the original features to the new feature embedding space, the DNN can better learn the rules in the input data. In addition, the features of target and transcriptome profiles show completely different distributions from the molecular fingerprints, which may provide new insights into the representations of compounds for related studies.  

# Application scenarios  

Application scenarios of TOXRIC includes:  

(i) Individual compound searches and downloads are available for toxicological investigations, interpretation of toxicological mechanisms, and compound/drug discovery. The toxicity values, chemical information, transcriptional profiles, metabolic reaction equations, targets and enrichment results of each compound can be queried through the TOXRIC website. All the related toxicological and feature data for an individual compound can be downloaded on the compound page.   
(ii) To help researches better understand the representation of compounds in different feature spaces, TOXRIC provides visualization of molecular representation distribution of multiple feature types, in

cluding original structure, target, transcriptome feature and embedding after representation learning of ML models. The clustering effects of molecular representations can help researchers intuitively understand and interpret the mechanisms of toxicities in different spaces.  

(iii) For development of computational methods in toxicity prediction, TOXRIC provides comprehensive MLready datasets and benchmarks. The ML-ready endpoint and feature type datasets can be downloaded separately on the Download page and can be used directly as output or input to ML models for toxicity prediction. The two types of benchmarks can help researchers select appropriate feature types and baseline algorithms for each toxicity endpoint prediction task.  

# COMPARISON WITH EXISTING DATABASES  

There is an abundance of online databases providing access to large amounts of toxicology data. For example, researchers within U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s National Center for Computational Toxicology (NCCT) have developed several research programs, databases and web-based interfaces (dashboards), including the ToxCast program and the affiliated Tox21 program (22,23), Aggregated Computational Toxicology Online Resource (ACToR) (55), DSSTox database (56) and CompTox Chemistry Dashboard (Dashboard) (57,58), which provides comprehensive in vitro bioassay data and other chemical information of compounds. We classified the existing online toxicological databases into four categories, toxicity category-centric, toxic feature-centric, compound-centric, and ML task-centric. Some statistics and comparisons of the databases are listed in Table 1.  

# Toxicity category-centric databases  

Databases in this category target specific toxicity categories or testing programs of compounds. For instance, EPA’s ToxCast and Tox21 program are engaged in the generation and analysis of in vitro bioassay data for thousands of chemicals evaluated in high-throughput (HTS) assays. CEBS (13) collects animal public environmental health data primarily from National Toxicology Program (NTP) testing program. EnviroTox (59) aims at ecotoxicity. DILIrank database (16) focuses on data of drug-induced liver toxicity. The above databases focus on a single toxicity category, and the data available in most of these databases are integrated into TOXRIC.  

In addition, The Integrated Chemical Environment (ICE) database (60) has collected multiple toxicity categories from multiple sources, including ToxCast data, acute toxicity, endocrine, developmental and reproductive toxicity. The functions of data retrieval and dataset download are provided. Whereas the endpoints of the collected datasets are not further processed and curated into ML-ready format. TOXRIC not only curated more endpoints into a standardized format, but also provides multiple curated feature types and benchmark results of each endpoint dataset.  

# Toxic feature-centric databases  

The toxic feature-centric databases provide toxic-related omics or other feature data, such as ToxicoDB (67), DrugMatrix (45), and Open TG-GATEs databases (61). All of them are toxicogenomic database that stores gene expression profiles derived from in vivo, in vitro exposure to compounds. DrugMatrix contains gene expression data of ${>}200$ compounds tested in the in vivo rat tissues (e.g. liver), and 125 compounds tested in the in vitro rat hepatocytes. Open TG-GATEs stores gene expression profiles derived from in vivo (rat) and in vitro (primary rat hepatocytes, primary human hepatocytes) exposure to 170 compounds at multiple dosages and time points. Data in ToxicoDB is collected from the above two databases, which are also collected into the feature space of TOXRIC. Besides the transcriptome profiles, TOXRIC provides 39 feature types covering structural, target, metabolic data and other descriptors.  

# Compound-centric databases  

The compound-centric databases provide comprehensive chemical and toxicological information on compounds. EPA’s DSSTox database (launched in 2004) and Dashboard (launched in 2016) are used as integration platforms that combined the ToxCast/Tox21 programs with other research efforts. The EPA’s ACToR database contains knowledge extracted from multiple collections and has been retired now. The above EPA’s databases focus primarily on data from in vitro bioassays. The most widely used database, Dashboard, provides chemical/toxicology data retrieval, and compound/assay dataset download. However, except for ToxCast/Tox21 assay, data on other toxicity categories is not organized into datasets for download. For other compound-centric databases, T3DB database (15) focuses on information of toxic exposome, including detailed chemical and target information of toxins. The eChemPortal database provides free access to chemicals and associated properties, allowing searches by compounds and Global Hazard Summary (GHS) classification. These databases serve only to retrieve multiple toxicities and chemical information of compounds. There is no curated endpoint dataset. Compared to these databases, TOXRIC not only provides data retrieval of compounds, but also provides the curated endpoint and feature type datasets that can be used directly in computational methods.  

In addition, there are some large chemically-indexed databases, such as PubChem (62), ChEMBL (63), and CTD (64), which are not focus on toxicology, but provide toxicology-related information. However, the toxicological data provided by them is not organized into dataset. Most of the information provided for retrieval is the text content of literatures, and no qualitative or quantitative toxicity value is provided.  

# ML task-centric databases  

There are two ML task-centric databases, TDC (17) and MoleculeNet (18), which are platforms to provide datasets, ML tasks, benchmarks, and other information for various fields of study, such as ADMET, drug combination, quantum mechanical- and biophysical-related studies. Neither is a database directly focused on toxicology, nor does it provide data retrieval. In TDC, the datasets need to be obtained by calling the functions from Python code, and the benchmarks need to be obtained after the training process. In MoleculeNet, the benchmarks of four toxicology datasets and eight algorithms are provided in bar charts. Neither is a database provide benchmark for features and representation distribution. And the toxicology datasets are not categorized by toxicity categories. Compared to both databases, TOXRIC focuses on toxicity studies, covering chemical information, more toxicity categories, and feature types of compounds, which can be quickly retrieved on the web. The benchmark results displayed on TOXRIC web are intuitive and contain more feature types on $>1000$ endpoint datasets. Taken together, TOXRIC covers a wider range of toxicity categories and feature spaces. The toxicity values, chemical information, transcriptional profiles, metabolic reaction equations, targets, and enrichment results of each compound can be retrieved through the TOXRIC website. The endpoint and feature type datasets have been organized into ML-ready format to be downloaded. The benchmarks for feature types and algorithms can facilitate the development of AI-based computational toxicology. The visualization of molecular representation distributions can help researchers better understand and interpret the mechanisms of toxicities in different spaces.

# CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION  

TOXRIC has five core functions, comprehensive data, MLready downloadable datasets, practical benchmarks, informative visualization of molecular representations, and an intuitive function interface. To accelerate the development of toxicity evaluation and compound discovery, TOXRIC provides comprehensive and standardized toxicological, feature, and chemical data for toxicity retrieval. To better utilize and understand the data, TOXRIC performs a system-level analysis and displays informative visualization of benchmarks and molecular representations on all the toxicity endpoints. TOXRIC offers an effective and userfriendly web interface to take full advantage of the wealthy data, ML-ready datasets, benchmarks, and molecular representation distribution. Users can retrieve the toxicological information of compounds, browse the detailed information of datasets, download the curated datasets, view the results of benchmarks and molecular representation distribution on TOXRIC web.  

For data collection, TOXRIC has always been committed to implementing the FAIR principles (73) to enhance the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of its data. To be findable, all compounds in TOXRIC come with a unique and persistent identifier, TAID, which is used to link the toxicology and feature data of each compound. TOXRIC is freely accessible for academics from a stable, permanent web address (https://toxric.bioinforai.tech/), and does not require account creation or logon. TOXRIC can also be dynamically queried through HTML direct links. To be interoperable, TOXRIC incorporates identifiers and physicochemical properties of compounds from PubChem, and provides external links to PubChem on compound page. Users can click on the PubChem CID to link to the corresponding compound page of PubChem website. In addition, TOXRIC web provide links to all the related databases on the External Database Links page. To be reusable, TOXRIC’s curation paradigms are fully described in the manuscript. All datasets collected in the database are described in detail on Data Collection page and can be reused in downloadable files with machine-readable formats (.csv) on Download page of the website.  

The 1474 endpoint datasets stored in TOXRIC contain in vivo and in vitro datasets. For the in vivo endpoints, the ADME process of various pharmacokinetic effects can be measured. However, live animal experiments are flawed with ethical, economic, and scientific limitations. Compared with in vivo endpoints, in vitro experiment has advantages in terms of economy, condition control and safety. Computational methods can be used to relate in vitro to in vivo endpoints, i.e. in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) method (74). The IVIVE is often performed with a toxicokinetic (TK) or a physiologically pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling-based reverse dosimetry, to estimate the in vivo dose required to achieve an in vitro bioactive concentration in the blood or target tissue (74–76). The bioactive concentration includes point of departures (PODs), activity concentration causing $50\%$ maximum activity (AC50), or lowest effective concentration. In TOXRIC database, there are a large amount of in vitro data stored in ToxCast&Tox21 Assay, which uses HTS techniques to study the perturbations provoked by chemicals to biochemical and biological pathways in isolated systems in vitro. Some IVIVE approaches have been applied to translate in vitro bioactivity concentrations from the ToxCast&Tox21 data to the daily human oral doses (i.e. human equivalent doses, HEDs) (75–78).  

Several limitations in the TOXRIC should be elaborated. First, TOXRIC simply provide both in vitro and in vivo endpoints, without further distinguishing and linking the in vitro and in vivo data. In vitro results do not necessary, neither always, correlate to in vivo. This is an issue that needs to be taken care of whether using in vitro data for model building, or using IVIVE methods to extrapolate in vitro data into in vivo. Second, the data provided by TOXRIC is still insufficient. There are still many resources involved toxicology data, such as PubChem, ChEMBL and related literatures. The NOAEL or LOAEL data should also be integrated into TOXRIC. For feature spaces, multi-omics integration will be a core content of TOXRC in the future. Currently, there is only transcriptome data integrated in TOXRIC, other omics data should be added. Third, some datasets show poor performance in benchmarks may be due to the characteristics such as small-sized samples and class imbalance. Thus, more data should be collected in these datasets. At the same time, these characteristics of datasets should be further analyzed, which will motivate ML scientists to develop new algorithms for this problem.  

In the future, we plan to integrate more data from other resources and literatures into TOXRIC, including more toxicity categories, toxicity values, compounds, multi-omics and multi-views feature types. The data quality will be controlled manually and the data management will follow the FAIR principles. In addition, the detailed analysis of characteristics of endpoint datasets will be added according to benchmarks and representation distributions. More visualization tools will be developed to display the characteristics of datasets. Then researchers can develop better methods to solve the problems of datasets.  

TOXRIC will be continuously updated with new entries, datasets, and benchmarks to facilitate the development of compound discovery and toxicity prediction efforts of ML scientists. We hope that TOXRIC can serve as a comprehensive resource for the toxicologists and a benchmark platform for the computational toxicology community to drive algorithmic and scientific advances.

# ABSTRACT  

PITDB is a freely available database of translated genomic elements (TGEs) that have been observed in PIT (proteomics informed by transcriptomics) experiments. In PIT, a sample is analyzed using both RNAseq transcriptomics and proteomic mass spectrometry. Transcripts assembled from RNA-seq reads are used to create a library of sample-specific amino acid sequences against which the acquired mass spectra are searched, permitting detection of any TGE, not just those in canonical proteome databases. At the time of writing, PITDB contains over 74 000 distinct TGEs from four species, supported by more than 600 000 peptide spectrum matches. The database, accessible via http://pitdb.org, provides supporting evidence for each TGE, often from multiple experiments and an indication of the confidence in the TGE’s observation and its type, ranging from known protein (exact match to a UniProt protein sequence), through multiple types of protein variant including various splice isoforms, to a putative novel molecule. PITDB’s modern web interface allows TGEs to be viewed individually or by species or experiment, and downloaded for further analysis. PITDB is for bench scientists seeking to share their PIT results, for researchers investigating novel genome products in model organisms and for those wishing to construct proteomes for lesser studied species.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Annotation of genomes is a significant endeavor in modern biology, as we seek a comprehensive picture of the many distinct elements each genome contains and try to determine the role that these elements play. After many years of research in the area it is tempting to assume that predicting which genomic elements code for proteins is a solved problem, but recent research has shown this is not the case. Even in Homo sapiens, experimental studies have suggested that widely accepted protein coding regions are not seen to express proteins (1,2), while supposedly non-coding elements such as pseudogenes and so-called non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are in fact translated (1–4). Furthermore, most human genes express multiple protein isoforms through alternate splicing, and novel genomic products have been observed such as fusion proteins (5–9) and short open reading frames (sORFs) (3,10,11). Expression of these products is currently difficult to predict computationally. In non-model organisms our understanding is worse still, with no reliable catalogue of the proteome available for many important species. For example, the notable disease vector black flying fox (Pteropus alecto) has just two experimentally confirmed proteins in UniProt.  

The advent of RNA-seq (12,13) transcriptomics has gone some way toward solving the genome annotation problem, by allowing high-throughput open and unbiased sequencing of transcripts that can be mapped back to the genome. De novo transcript assembly tools such as Trinity (14), and emerging long read sequencing methods such as PacBio (15) even allow full length transcripts to be sequenced without a reference genome assembly. However, the presence of a transcript does not by itself tell us whether that transcript is translated into an amino acid chain. For that, we have previously developed the PIT (proteomics informed by transcriptomics) methodology (16). PIT uses RNA-seq data to generate species-blind sample-specific search databases for liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS) shotgun proteomics, thereby facilitating the unbiased identification of translated genomic elements (TGEs) even in the absence of a reference proteome. This contrasts with traditional proteomics, where the proteomic mass spectra are searched against standard canonical proteomes, prohibiting the discovery of novel TGEs. We use the term TGE because these molecules are amino acid chains derived from the genome but we cannot guarantee that they are all viable proteins, although in practice the vast majority of TGEs are indeed proteins.  

To facilitate the complex process of analyzing data from PIT experiments, we have implemented workflows for such analysis on a dedicated publicly available Galaxy (17) server called GIO (Galaxy Integrated Omics) (18) (gio.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk). These workflows allow rapid and repeatable analysis of PIT data with results produced in a uniform format. The availability of these workflows has led to an increasing uptake of the PIT approach, leading in turn to the creation of more matched RNA-seq and LC-MS/MS datasets. These experiments are generally intended to answer specific biological questions and data from these has been analyzed with those questions in mind, but there is a clear benefit to bringing these datasets together as they contain a substantial amount of information about a diverse range of TGEs, which can be integrated and mined. While the output of our PIT workflows is very comprehensive and uniform in format (we offer tabular output, GFF3 genome annotation files and links back to the workflows used and the original data) to date there has been no structured repository for the sharing and integration of these results. Sharing and comparing data is essential if we are to build confidence in potential novel findings such as novel protein isoforms and other interesting TGEs. It can also help to refine genome annotation in model organisms and accelerate the annotation of recently sequenced genomes from non-model species.  

Here we present a data sharing solution in the form of PITDB, a web accessible database of PIT results. At the heart of this database are the TGEs, each of which is supported by evidence at the mRNA and peptide level and has associated metadata about the sample(s) in which the TGE was observed. Many of the TGEs have been observed in multiple samples, some from multiple species, and the evidence for individual TGEs is strengthened as more experimental data is added.  

At the most basic level, PITDB can be used to share the results of a PIT experiment, in support of a publication. While repositories exist for transcriptomic and proteomic data, PITDB is currently the only database that brings these data types together in a fully integrated way. Wider applications of PITDB include the identification of novel TGEs, including novel isoforms of known proteins, in model organisms such as human. Although the chance of finding novel TGEs in well-studied species is small, such TGEs are likely to be of great interest. For lesser studied organisms PITDB provides a rapid route to a draft proteome. This proteome can be analyzed computationally, or can be used as a search database for further proteomics experiments.  

# IDENTIFICATION AND CLASSIFICATION OF TGEs  

In every experiment covered by PITDB, both RNA-seq and LC-MS/MS data were collected from the same sample. PITDB is populated with TGEs identified from this data using an enhanced version of our previously published genome-guided PIT workflow (18), a high level overview of which is shown in Figure 1. The first step in this workflow is de novo assembly of the RNA-seq short reads into transcripts using Trinity (14). These transcripts are then passed on to the Program to Assemble Spliced Alignments (PASA) (19), which first runs the SeqClean (https://sourceforge.net/ projects/seqclean/) utility to identify and remove poly(A) tails, trim vectors and remove low quality sequences. PASA maps the remaining transcripts to a reference genome using a spliced alignment process that infers the intron–exon structure of the parent gene. PASA assembles clusters of overlapping transcript alignments (overlapping transcripts that have the exact same gene structure in the overlapping region) into maximal alignment assemblies that are partial/prematurely ended assemblies of Trinity. By doing this it reduces the number of incomplete ORFs (ORFs that are missing either or both the start and end codons) and duplicate transcripts, minimizing search space in the later peptide identification step. Any transcripts that do not map to the selected genome assembly (e.g. from viruses that may be present in the sample) are discarded at this stage. Transdecoder (20) is then used to find ORFs within the PASA assembled transcripts. ORFs smaller than 11 AAs long and encapsulated inside other ORFs are filtered out. Transdecoder also produces GFF3 and BED files for the predicted ORFs, which are used in PITDB to show genomic context. The final list of ORFs (augmented with sequences of common contaminant proteins to avoid false identifications) is then used to identify peptide spectra from the corresponding LC-MS/MS data. ${\mathrm{\bfMSGF^{+}}}$ (21) was used for peptide spectrum matching, and mzIdentML-lib (22) for post processing and protein inference. Search parameters (e.g. fixed and variable modifications, mass tolerance etc.) for ${\mathrm{\bfMSGF^{+}}}$ were set according to the proteomics protocol used in each experiment. A target-decoy search strategy was employed, with a $1\%$ peptide spectrum match (PSM) level false discovery rate cut-off applied throughout. Identified TGEs with less than two peptides were removed, giving a final list of TGEs for upload to PITDB.  

At this point the only identifying information we have about each TGE is its amino acid sequence. Further processing is needed to determine whether each TGE is a known protein, a variant of an existing protein, or something novel. The first step in this process is to BLAST each TGE sequence against the UniProt complete proteome (including both SwissProt and TrEMBL sequences, and isoforms where available) for the species being studied. For the purposes of this comparison, a BLAST e-value below $1\times10^{-30}$ is taken to indicate a match between identified sequences as this is widely regarded as indicating strong homology between proteins. We classify the TGE based on the type and strength of alignment it has against the UniProt proteins. Identified TGEs with an exact match ( $100\%$ sequence identity) to a UniProt protein are labeled as known proteins and the accession number of the matching protein recorded. A TGE is labeled as a known protein variant when the BLAST e-value threshold is met and the alignment covers the full length of the TGE and the UniProt protein but it is not an exact match. The alignment may include single or multiple amino acid differences, insertions or deletions. Some TGE sequences map to a UniProt protein with the required $e$ -value but may not cover the whole length of the protein, or may extend beyond the start or end of the protein. The alignments may or may not have variations as well. These TGEs are classified as potential novel isoforms of the protein. TGEs that do not map to any UniProt protein with a BLAST $e$ -value below the $1\times10^{-30}$ threshold are classed as novel TGEs. These TGEs may be proteins that have not previously been observed or predicted for the species under study, or a more exotic molecule such as a sORF, translated ncRNA, or fusion protein. Further analysis is needed to determine exactly what they may be.

Figure 1. Simplified schematic showing how the PIT workflow populates PITDB. First, TGEs are found by de novo assembling transcripts from RNAseq data, mapping these against a genome, then searching MS/MS data from the same sample against ORFs generated from the transcripts. ORFs with peptide evidence (TGEs) are then BLASTed against protein sequences from UniProt to classify them as known, novel, isoform, etc. and assess the level of confidence in that classification using the factors shown in Table 1. All key results generated during the process are deposited in the integrated PITDB database, which can be accessed via the web.  

The pipeline for TGE identification and classification has been made publicly available so that researchers can apply it to their own data, to generate PIT results suitable for submission to PITDB. Submission instructions can be found on the web site.  

# DATABASE ORGANIZATION AND CONTENT  

The fundamental object within PITDB is the TGE. Each TGE has a unique amino acid sequence and accession number (e.g. TGE0000273). Through the aforementioned classification procedure each TGE is also assigned a class, and a UniProt accession number if a homologous protein is found. Every TGE is derived from one or more TGE observations, each of which is in turn supported by experimental evidence from both transcriptomics (transcripts assembled from RNA-seq reads) and proteomics (PSMs). The evidence for each observation is stored within the database and used to determine the level of confidence in the observation of all protein variants. Confidence is represented in the PITDB user interface as a star rating according to the scheme shown in Table 1. Each observation is from a specific species and a specific sample, which is described by metadata including the experiment to which the sample belongs. In turn, experimental metadata summarizes the source of the sample, including the publication to which it relates.  

At the time of writing, PITDB contains over 74,000 distinct TGEs from four species ( $H.$ . sapiens, Mus musculus, Aedes aegypti, P. alecto). A summary of these TGEs is shown in Table 2. The total number of TGEs varies by species according to the type and number of experiments captured by PITDB for that species. For example, the total number of human TGEs is relatively low (12,877) because the majority of human samples in PITDB are from the ex

All TGEs in PITDB are ORFs derived from transcripts supported by at least two peptides observed by mass spectrometry. Confidence is increased if the following criteria are met: (i) the ORF is complete (has a recognized start and stop codon), (ii) the peptide evidence is from the variant region, (iii) the variant peptide(s) uniquely map to this protein and (iv) the probability of the variant being genuine is high according to our pipeline.  

tracellular matrix. Pteropus alecto and $M.$ . musculus have approximately double the number of TGEs because data from multiple whole cell lysate samples from these species is present in the database. PITDB contains TGEs classed as novel (i.e. insufficient homology with any UniProt protein from the species under study or no mapping) for all four species. As may be expected, human has by far the lowest number of novel TGEs (119, none of which have unique peptide evidence) as it has a very well documented proteome. Conversely, $P.$ alecto has 1,066 novel TGEs thanks to its relatively incomplete UniProt proteome.

We have TGEs from four species including two well-studied species (human and mouse) and two without a well-established proteome ( $P.$ alecto and $A$ . aegypti). TGEs are categorized into 19 classes: known protein, known protein with variation, 16 distinct types of novel isoform and novel based on their BLAST alignments to reference proteomes of the species under study. A small percentage of identified TGEs have variations such as single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs), multiple amino acid alterations (ALT), insertions and deletions. Among the isoforms of known proteins, a large proportion of TGEs show partial mapping to an existing protein with a longer or shorter sequence.  

# Web interface  

The data within PITDB can be accessed via the web interface by browsing by experiment and sample, or through one of six views that are accessed via a simple search box. One of these is the experiment view, which provides an overview of a specified experiment. This overview includes summary statistics such as the number of samples in the experiment and the total number of TGEs observed, a description of the experiment and graphical and tabular overviews of the observed TGEs. This experiment view can be used to share the results of a particular published experiment, by citing the PITDB experiment accession number (e.g. EXP000001) in the publication. The sample view provides similar functionality at the individual sample level.  

The species view provides access to PITDB’s content related to a selected species. It can be considered an experimentally derived, though almost certainly incomplete, proteome of the species in question. This view (see Figure 2A for an example) shows a summary of the information that PITDB holds about that species, including the total number of TGEs observed. The full list of TGEs is shown in an interactive table, which can be searched and sorted to find TGEs of interest. TGEs can be downloaded in tabular (CSV) format, or as FASTA files, for further analysis by clicking the download button above the table. Similar functionality is provided for other tables throughout PITDB. The FASTA file may be used in the construction of a database against which to search proteomic mass spectrometry data in future experiments.  

The TGE view is accessed by clicking on a TGE in a table, or by searching for a specific TGE by either its accession number, or by a full or partial sequence. This view summarizes everything that PITDB knows about a particular TGE, including the species in which it has been observed, UniProt proteins with which it shares homology, and details of the individual observations including the transcript sequence underlying the observation and details of the mass spectrometry evidence (PSMs and their $q$ -values––see Figure 2B). If appropriate, amino acid differences between the observed TGE and homologous proteins are also shown in a variations tables (Figure 2C).  

The protein view shows all TGEs that are homologous with a known UniProt protein. It is necessarily only available for proteins from species with well annotated genomes and proteins in UniProt. However, it includes both SwissProt and TrEMBL proteins so can be used to confirm the existence of a protein that had previously only been computationally predicted. PITDB TGEs relating to the specified protein are shown in their genomic context (using the GFF files produced by Transdecoder), together with known genome annotations from Ensembl and PIT peptide evidence (see Figure 2D). Boundary crossing peptides that define introns can clearly be seen––a good example of transcriptomic information being reinforced by proteomic data. Clicking on a feature in the genome browser brings up a box containing further details, for example the q-value of the identification in the case of peptides.  

Protein views can also be accessed via the gene search functionality. Here, the user enters a gene symbol (e.g. COL6A3) and is then presented with a list of any protein products of that gene for which there is evidence in PITDB. Clicking on one of the proteins listed leads directly to the relevant protein view.  

# DISCUSSION  

PITDB is a unique repository of experimentally observed TGEs, built on data from both RNA-seq and LC-MS/MS performed on the same samples. There is much work to do in analyzing the content of this database, for example to investigate novel protein isoforms and TGEs. PITDB’s architecture is eminently scalable and we plan to continue adding more PIT results, which will increase both the breadth of species covered and the strength of evidence underpinning individual TGEs. We have also identified a number of additional features which would increase the research value of PITDB. First among these is the addition of support for quantitative data, as RNA-seq is inherently quantitative and SILAC (23–26) and TMT (27) protocols are often used to provide protein abundance information in PIT experiments. It would also be useful to extend the TGE classification workflow to provide a more fine-grained classification of novel TGEs, by automatically searching against databases of known sORFs and ncRNAs for example.

# ABSTRACT  

PomBase (www.pombase.org) is a new model organism database established to provide access to comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date molecular data and biological information for the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe to effectively support both exploratory and hypothesisdriven research. PomBase encompasses annotation of genomic sequence and features, comprehensive manual literature curation and genome-wide data sets, and supports sophisticated user-defined queries. The implementation of PomBase integrates a Chado relational database that houses manually curated data with Ensembl software that supports sequence-based annotation and web access. PomBase will provide user-friendly tools to promote curation by experts within the fission yeast community. This will make a key contribution to shaping its content and ensuring its comprehensiveness and long-term relevance.  

# INTRODUCTION  

The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a well-studied eukaryotic model organism that has been used since the 1950s to obtain valuable insights into diverse eukaryotic biological processes including the cell growth and division cycle, genome organization and maintenance, cell morphology and cytokinesis, signaling and stress responses, chromatin and gene regulation and meiotic differentiation (1). Moreover, since the completion of its genome sequence in 2002 (2), fission yeast has emerged as a prime model for the characterization of processes relevant to human disease and cell biology. A large and active community engages in biological and biomedical research using this model system, routinely applying molecular genetic, cell biological and biochemical techniques. Data from small- and large-scale projects are accumulating rapidly and will increase substantially over the next few years; the literature corpus currently exceeds 9000 publications and grows by about 500 publications per year.  

PomBase (http://www.pombase.org) has recently been established to provide user-friendly and standardized access to genomic features and annotations, enabling scientists to assimilate novel findings into their research programs, improve experimental design, support the interpretation of genetic screens, and facilitate the interpretation of functional genomics and systems biology experiments. An accurate and comprehensive set of manual annotations of gene products based on published data lies at the centre of this database, and is supplemented by automatic annotation and information about non-genic features. The PomBase project aims to provide three key resources to the fission yeast community:  

Comprehensive and deep curation of the scientific literature;   
. A software infrastructure to support curation activities; and  

. A computational infrastructure to integrate data curated from the literature with the genomic sequence, high-throughput data sets, and data from other fungal genomes.  

# DATA TYPES AND SOURCES  

Historically, functional information about the genome and biology of S. pombe has been maintained in a repository hosted by the GeneDB project at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) (http://old.genedb.org/genedb/ pombe/). This resource is now superseded by PomBase, which has not only inherited the data from GeneDB, but also includes additional curated data types and high-throughput data sets. The major data types available in PomBase are listed in Table 1.  

# Sequence feature annotation  

DNA and protein features are annotated using the Sequence Ontology (SO) (4). Currently, 31 DNA feature terms are used in $25650$ annotations (examples include gene, exon, tRNA, centromere) and 22 protein feature terms for 919 annotations (examples include nuclear localization signal, ER retention signal, DDB box).  

# Gene Ontology annotation  

Gene Ontology (GO) (5,6) terms are assigned to gene products to represent their molecular functions, cellular components (including complexes), and biological processes. PomBase GO annotation data comprises over 33 500 manual annotations and approximately 3500 automatically assigned annotations, using 3800 unique GO terms.  

# Phenotype annotation  

To support the comprehensive and detailed representation of phenotypes, we are developing the Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO), a formal ontology of phenotypes observed in fission yeast. FYPO is a modular ontology that uses several existing ontologies from the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) collection (7) as building blocks, including the phenotypic quality ontology PATO (8), GO, and Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) (9). Over 7000 existing annotations have been converted from the legacy GeneDB controlled vocabulary to FYPO terms; these annotations will support sophisticated querying, computational analysis, and comparison between different experiments and even between different species.  

# Genetic and physical interactions  

Annotation of genetic and physical interactions are supported using the BioGRID (http://thebiogrid.org) (10,11) annotation format. Existing annotations curated by BioGRID are imported into PomBase, and newly created annotations will be exchanged with BioGRID.

PomBase incorporates a wide variety of data sets that can be mapped to the genome, obtained either from internal sources or via externally loaded URLs or data files. Examples of supported data sets include whole genome re-sequencing data, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data, various microarray data and other high-throughput data types.  

# USER ACCESS TO POMBASE  

A web portal has been developed for access to the PomBase data, which provides pages describing the current state of annotation of the S. pombe genome, items of interest to the community, and, most importantly, a ‘Gene Overview Page’ that summarizes key information about each gene. Embedded in this portal is a genome browser, providing access to genomic context, sequence-based analyses and high-throughput data.

Figure 1. PomBase Gene Overview Page highlights. (A) Top of page showing essential information and genomic region. (B) Phenotype and GO annotation. (C) Additional curated data, including orthologs, interactions and external references. (D) Literature pertinent to the gene.  

# Gene Overview Pages  

Gene Overview pages organize gene-specific information, including the gene type, product description, sequence features, phenotypes, Gene Ontology annotation and protein modifications as well as physical and genetic interactions. These pages are central to PomBase (see Figure 1).  

# Searching  

A simple search is available on every PomBase page. The Advanced Search allows users to perform queries on multiple feature types including GO annotation, protein domain, characterization status, species distribution, protein length, etc. A query history summarizes queries and allows them to be edited or combined using union or intersection.  

# Genome browser  

The PomBase genome browser has been implemented using software developed by the Ensembl project (12).  

The Ensembl genome browser is a powerful system, offering support for the visualization of sequence, functional annotations, alignments, comparative data and polymorphisms. Many of these features are already exploited by PomBase, and others will be used as and when required for the incorporation of new data types. The use of standard technology readily supports comparative analyses with the genomes of other species that are accessible via Ensembl (also see ‘Implementation’ section, below). Comparative analyses with other fungal genomes and with a range of taxonomically diverse genomes are provided using data generated by the Ensembl Genomes project (13). The Ensembl API enables users interested in comparative analyses to retrieve all data of interest from multiple species present in Ensembl.  

# IMPLEMENTATION  

The implementation of PomBase harnesses and integrates three complementary, well supported and mature technologies, Chado (14), Ensembl and Drupal (http:// www.drupal.org). Chado provides an environment for manual curation and the management of curated data while Ensembl provides end-user access via the web portal and display of sequence-based features.  

# Chado  

Curated PomBase data are stored in a PostgreSQL database using the Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD)-compliant Chado schema. Chado supports the management and storage of sequence annotation and literature curation using any combination of available ontologies, and is therefore easily extensible to new data types. Sequence features are curated in Chado using Artemis (15,16). New annotations produced by the PomBase curation team and the fission yeast community, and external data from BioGRID and UniProt/GOA (17), are loaded at regular intervals.  

# Ensembl  

Ensembl is a generic software platform for the automatic annotation, analysis and display of genomes, in use for over a decade. In PomBase, Ensembl provides public access to the integrated fission yeast data, and has been extended to display the deep literature curation managed in Chado. Gene model and annotation data are retrieved from the Chado database using the Bio::Chado::Schema Perl API, and loaded into an Ensembl MySQL database using the Ensembl Perl API. Data in the Ensembl MySQL database are accessible directly or via the Ensembl Perl API, and provide the content served both in the Genome Browser and in the Gene Overview pages. Data from the Ensembl database are also loaded into a BioMart data warehouse (18,19) which supports data mining via web and programmatic interfaces and also provides support for the advanced search (see below).  

# Drupal  

Drupal is a content management system that has been used to provide the web-based portal for PomBase. The use of Drupal has allowed the creation of a clean and intuitive user interface to access information about S. pombe and the PomBase project, and to support community-based functionality including wikis and discussion forums. To support the PomBase interface, two custom Drupal modules have been developed. The Gene Overview module is responsible for generating the Gene Overview pages by retrieving data about specific genes from a custom web service running on the Ensembl web server, which in turn uses the Ensembl Perl API to query the Ensembl MySQL databases. The Query Builder module supports the advanced search interface, and generates and submits custom queries to the BioMart web service to find genes matching specified criteria.  

# INTEGRATION OF USER DATA  

PomBase welcomes contributions from the community to improve the coverage and accuracy of its data. Users wanting to add or modify data in PomBase can directly contact the curation staff (E-mail: helpdesk $@$ pombase.org).  

Following a successful pilot project conducted in 2008, a generic web-based curation environment is being developed to support the launch of a comprehensive community curation initiative early in 2012 (Rutherford et al., in preparation). This will allow expert users to directly contribute annotations based on their publications, and will enhance the efforts of core curation staff and contribute to the sustainability of the curation effort in the face of increasing volumes of highly specialized published data.  

Additionally, there are many ways that users can directly visualize sequence-based data within the context of the web browser, including access to a Distributed Annotation System, data upload to a private area of the site, and dynamic integration of locally stored BAM files (using standard protocols such as HTTP, allowing users to directly visualize large-scale experimental results in the context of the reference annotation). Producers of mature data sets of any scale that are ready for full integration in PomBase and public dissemination should contact PomBase at the address above.  

# AVAILABILITY AND DATA PROPAGATION  

All of the tools, protocols and workflows developed by PomBase are publicly available (http://www.pombase .org/downloads) and can be implemented by other research communities to create analogous organismspecific databases either in collaboration with the Ensembl Genomes project or independently. Sequence, features and other annotation are available for bulk download via FTP, while subsets of data can be selectively downloaded using the PomBase BioMart.  

# FUTURE DIRECTIONS  

PomBase will continue to incorporate large-scale data sets and curate new data types. We will also incorporate sequence data, automatic annotation, and highthroughput data sets available for other species in the Schizosaccharomyces genus (20).  

We anticipate that usage of PomBase will extend beyond the $S_{\l}$ . pombe community to encompass evolutionary biologists studying genome variations and the evolution of yeasts, fungi, and the eukaryota in general; researchers seeking well-studied orthologs of genes of interest in human and other species; curators from other databases; and bioinformaticians and theoretical biologists requiring programmatic access to fission yeast data in order to construct and test novel hypotheses.

# Introduction  

Single cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) can map the status of genomewide chromatin accessibility at the single cell level. It exhibits significant advantages over Bulk ATAC-seq in revealing cell type-specific chromatin regulatory landscape and exploring broader biological phenomena from the perspective of epigenome coordination of gene expression (1–4 . Recent advances have shown that scATAC-seq had great promise in elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of cell differentiation, disease development and guiding new treatment strategies $5-$ 9 . Through single cell epigenomic profiling, one study has found that an NF- $\boldsymbol{\kappa}\mathrm{B}$ -driven pro-apoptotic signature could be used to stratify patients with early-stage clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), thus potentially advancing the search for immune-based treatment strategies for ccRCC (5 . The scATAC-seq has also enabled progress in plant research, such as enabling evaluation of the evolutionary effects of cis-regulatory variation on cellular differentiation between Zea mays and Arabidopsis thaliana (6 . However, scATACseq data have high dimensionality and sparsity, thus making downstream analysis more challenging than that of scRNAseq, particularly in terms of cell type annotation (10 11 . Accurate cell ype abeling s essential or effectively studying mportant biological phenomena but is limited by many factors, such as a lack of guideposts in the literature (12 . Manual or professional cell type annotation is not only generally considered the ‘ground truth’ but also aids in uncovering rare cell types, despite the process is labour-intensive (11 13 14 .  

Given the importance of accurate and professional cell labels, several single-cell databases supporting known cell labels have been developed and widely used, ncluding Cell Taxonomy (15 , SC2disease (16 , ImmCluster (17  and AgeAnno (18 . However, hese databases focus primarily on scRNA-seq data. Although AgeAnno the database provides scATAC-seq data, it is limited to data on human aging (18 . At present, large amounts of scATAC-seq data annotated by researchers have been accumulated, covering a wide range of cell/ issue types across multiple species 6 14 19 . Chang et al. have used fluorescence-activated cell sorting FACS) o dentify cell ypes in healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), bone marrow and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) samples (20 . Shendure et al. have provided single cell epigenomic data for 15 human organs, and annotated cell types by using a combination of automated annotation and manual review (21 . These studies have provided a rich resource for understanding and exploring gene regulation in various tissue/cell types. Clearly, there is an urgent need to allow researchers to flexibly and deeply mine these high-quality scATAC-seq data with known cell labels. Furthermore, scATAC-seq constitutes a highly specific molecular signature of cells providing extensive regulatory information, including chromatin accessibility and gene activity score and transcription factor (TF) enrichment score, thus providing substantial advantages n studying mechanisms of transcriptional and epigenetic regulation (22 23 . The characterization of chromatin accessibility, gene and TF in known cell subtypes has important implications for investigation of the potential roles of cells in biological processes such as growth and differentiation.  

Hence, we developed a database, scATAC-Ref (https://bio. liclab.net/scATAC-Ref/), to provide a large-scale resource of scATAC-seq data with known cell labels in five species. The current version of scATAC-Ref documents $\mathord{>}400$ cell/ issue types manually annotated by published articles, covering $1694372$ cells across five species: Human Mouse Danio rerio  Zea mays and Arabidopsis thaliana  Furthermore, comprehensive genome-wide chromatin accessibility analysis for known cells/ issues is crucial for exploring cell/ issue heterogeneity, and can help uncover key cell subtype and potential markers. Hence, for these scATAC-seq data with known cell labels, we used a uniform system environment and software parameters to calculate gene activity score, TF enrichment score, differential accessibility region (DAR) and pathway/GO term enrichment. The scATAC-Ref also provided a convenient, user-friendly interface to query, browse and visualize cell types of interest, to help elucidate cell type related functions and potential biological effects.  

# Materials and methods  

# Data collection and pre-processing of scATAC-seq  

To collect scATAC-seq datasets with issue/cell-type abels, we initially queried he PubMed database with (single cell ATACseq) OR (scATAC-seq) OR (single cell epigenomic)’ as keywords and obtained ${>}2000$ published literature (24 . Subsequently, we carefully reviewed the ‘Data availability’ sections of these literature and retained only scATAC-seq data containing cell type information and peak-by-cell matrix. These available scATAC-seq data were comprehensively curated and classified. Specifically, he ‘Data availability’ section in the literature usually describes the database or resource to which processed files have been deposited, mainly NCBI GEO (25 , Mouse Atlas (14 , Zendo and EMBL-EBI (26 . We manually extracted the experiment ID or website containing the processed file, such as the Series ID from the GEO database and Accession ID from EMBL-EBI. By querying the experiment ID in the corresponding database, we downloaded the processed files, including metadata and peak-to-cell matrix files. The metadata file generally provides UMAP coordinates and cell/ issue types inherited from the original articles. We manually adjusted the information from the metadata and extended the information to include species, health/disease status, PMID, data source and cell type annotating strategy from the original article or corresponding database (Supplementary Table S1). PMID, data source, species and cell type annotating strategy were extracted from the original articles. The health/disease status were mainly extracted from the sample description in the corresponding database. Finally, scATACRef included 1 694 372 cells from $>400$ cell/ issue types across five species: Human Mouse Danio rerio Zea mays and Arabidopsis thaliana  

The processed files from different studies were stored in different data formats, including MatrixMarket, rds, h5 and fragment, which store a peak-by-cell matrix. We unified the files into the ‘rds’ format for convenient downstream analysis. Next, to make the datasets comparable, we used TF-IDF method to normalize the peak-by-cell matrix. We then performed comprehensive downstream analysis based on a unified pipeline, ncluding identification of differential accessibility regions DARs), enrichment analysis or DAR-target genes, calculation of gene activity score and TF enrichment score, and prediction of co-accessibility. To improve the querying and calculation speed of the database, we randomly selected $40\ 000$ cells from samples with ${>}40\ 000$ cells to calculate the gene activity score, co-accessibility and TF enrichment score. In addition, the genomic coordinates of peaks were generated on the basis of specific versions of the genome, primarily hg38, hg19, $\mathrm{mm}10$ , $\mathrm{mm}9$ , TAIR10, GRCz10 and $\mathrm{B}73\mathrm{\v}4$ . In the downstream analysis, we used the same genome build as that in the original article to ensure version consistency. Simultaneously, the genomic coordinates of peaks in Human and Mouse were converted by liftOver (27  to support dual versions $(\mathrm{hg19/hg38}$ and $\mathrm{mm}10/\mathrm{mm}9.$ ).  

# Differential accessibility regions  

The changes in chromatin states help define the landscape of the cell/ issue-specific regulatory genome at single cell resolution and are associated with cell fate decisions throughout development (2 14 . In particular, the identification of differential accessibility regions (DARs) across known cell/ issue types s essential o understand cell diversity and explore effective diagnostic markers 28 . Therefore, scATAC-Ref provides DARs for each sample calculated with the runDA module of scATAC-pro (29 . Specifically, one cluster is compared with the remaining clusters with FindMarkers, and Wilcoxon test is used to determine significance $\boldsymbol{p}$ values. The false discovery rate FDR) method s used o adjust he $p$ values. To better explore the DARs, scATAC-Ref provides DAR associated nearest genes by using the assignGene2Peak function of scATACpro. The nearest gene was assigned as the gene with the shortest distance between the TSS and peak center in the range of $100\mathrm{kb}$ .  

# Enrichment analysis for DAR-target genes  

To help users elucidate the DAR function in each cell type, Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses are performed with he nearest genes of DARs or each cell ype by using the $R$ package clusterProfiler (30–32 . The background gene set consists of $n$ nearest genes of all DARs in sample. The hypergeometric test was used to calculate enrichment significance $P$ values (33 :  

$$
\ p=1-\sum_{x=0}^{i-1}{\frac{{\binom{k}{x}}{\binom{n-k}{s-x}}}{\binom{n}{s}}}
$$  

where $k$ are genes contained in the pathway under investigation, and $s$ are nearest genes of the cell type of interest, of which $i$ are involved in the same pathway. Next, the $P$ value was further adjusted by Benjamini $\&$ Hochberg (BH) method. Finally, the scATAC-Ref displays the GO terms and pathways with adjusted $P$ value $<0.05$ using bar charts and bubble charts.  

# Gene activity score and co-accessibility  

Chromatin accessibility regions contain various regulatory elements, and the chromatin interactions measured by their accessibility correlations summarize the higher-order interactions from chromatin architecture experiments (22 34 . To help understand the transcriptional regulation for each cell/ issue type, we predict co-accessibility interactions by using Cicero software with a hreshold ${>}0.25$ 22 . The peaks n interactions are further annotated to the nearest gene, to link cis-regulatory elements with the target genes. Furthermore, studies have shown that the accessibility of chromatin regions near genes is significantly correlated with transcriptional output, and s highly effective n quantifying he changes hat ead to the activation and inhibition of gene expression in a variety of cell types (1 35 . Hence, we also estimated gene activity score by using Cicero to help identify marker genes and assess the biological state for each cell/ issue type.  

# TF/motif enrichment score  

The enrichment score of TF/motif in single cell is measured with the $z$ score based on motif_analysis module of scATAC-pro. Specifically, we first obtained human TF motifs and mouse TF motifs using the $R$ package chromVARmotifs (23 . The motifs of other species were downloaded from the JASPAR CORE database 2022 (36 . Next, scATAC-pro used chromVAR on the top $30\%$ most variable peaks to determine the TF/motif $z$ score (23 . Differential TFs/motifs between one cell type and the remaining cell types are identified with a two-sample Wilcoxon test with $P$ value $<0.05$ . The TF/motif $z$ score and differential TFs/motifs are visualized using scatter plot and heatmap, respectively.

# Description of the database  

# Overview of scATAC-ref  

The scATAC-Ref database provides scATAC-seq datasets with known cell types on the basis of PubMed queries. We manually curated the meta-information to contain information on the study, cell type, tissue, experiment, health/disease status, sex and species. We further performed a unified normalization and downstream analysis on these datasets from different sources, including differential accessibility region identification, pathway/GO term enrichment analysis, gene activity score and TF $\mathbf{z}$ -score calculation and co-accessibility prediction (Figure 1  top panel). scATAC-Ref currently provides scATAC-seq datasets for five species, covering 1 694 372 cells and $\mathord{>}400$ cell/ issue types. For these datasets and downstream analysis results, scATAC-Ref ncludes our search models, an analysis tool and user-friendly browser and download (Figure 1  bottom panel).  

# Search interface for scATAC-seq  

We designed our search models: Search by Cell Type, Custom Search, Search by Genomic Region and Search by Multiple  

Samples (Figure 2A). In the cell type-based query, users can determine the scope of the samples by specifying the species, tissue and cell type of interest. The general information is displayed in the result table, including sample ID, source, known cell label, tissue and PMID. Users can click the sample of interest to view more detailed information, including the health/disease status and description of cell type assigned in the original literature (Figure 2B). The percentage of these cell types in the sample is further calculated and visualized in a pie chart (Figure 2B). In addition, the UMAP projection, gene activity scores and TF $z$ score are displayed in a scatter diagram, colored by known cell labels, gene and TF scores, respectively (Figure 2C–E). Users can view the activity of gene and $z$ score of TF of interest in each cell type. The interactive table describes the DARs (Figure 2F), and the pathway/GO term enrichment analysis results of heir nearest genes are urther visualized (Figure 2G). The differential TFs/motifs are also calculated, and their details and $z$ score can be flexibly viewed in the interactive table and heatmap (Figure 2H). In Custom Search, users can determine a sample of interest through filtering by species, issue, cell type and sample name. In particular, the Custom Search supports entry of two genes and specifying heir gene activity status activity/non-activity) and relationship (and/or). Users can divide the cells in a sample into two categories according to custom gene activity status. scATAC-Ref further provides the distribution and details for these cells (Figure 2 ). In Search by Differential Accessibility Region, when a genome location is entered, scATACRef returns DARs overlapping with the input regions. Users can also click the Sample ID to view the detailed information described above. In Search by Multiple Samples, when users select two samples of interest via filtering by species, tissue, known cell type and sample name, scATAC-Ref displays detailed sample information in the left and right modules, o enable ntuitive comparison of he gene activity scores, TF $z$ score, DARs, etc.

# Online analysis tool  

The scATAC-Ref provides a genomic region enrichment analysis function to offer valuable insights into the potential roles of genomic regions (Figure 2J). First, the DARs for each cell type in each sample are taken as the enrichment analysis reference sets. Users can submit a list of genomic regions and set the significance $P$ value threshold. Subsequently, scATAC-Ref uses the genomic region enrichment analysis method LOLA to calculate the enrichment significance between the input regions and reference sets, to identify the cell/ issue types that are significantly enriched (37 38 . On the results page, a bubble chart shows the enrichment analysis results, and a table describes the details of the enriched cell/ issue types (Figure 2J).  

# Browsing interface  

The Browser’ page s organized as an nteractive and alphanumerically sortable table that allows users to quickly search for samples and customize ‘Species’, Tissue’ and ‘Known Cell Type’ filters (Figure 2K). Users can use the ‘Show Entries’ drop-down menu to change the number of records per page. Users can view the detailed information for a given sample by clicking on the ‘Sample ID’.  

# Data download  

The data on DARs and differential TFs/motifs of each sample are provided for download on the ‘Download’ page. We also support exporting query results in the ‘Search Result’ page.  

# Summary  

High-quality single-cell epigenetic regulation analyses contribute to the understanding of the developmental and evolutionary dynamics of gene regulation in biological phenomena, such as organ development and disease progression (39 . Annotating cells in the analysis of scATAC-seq data is a challenging task that researchers are actively addressing, which poses a critical barrier to widespread data re-use and exploration. Although several resources, such as HTCA and scEnhancer focus on scATAC-seq data (40 41 , none of them focus on chromatin accessibility for cells with known labels annotated on the basis of investigators’ background knowledge of the signature molecules. Among existing resources, HTCA uses singleR software to automatically predict cell types with low cell type coverage. scEnhancer focuses on the regulatory landscape of enhancers but not the broader chromatin accessible region, which includes DNA regulatory elements such as promoters and silencers. In contrast, our database provides the most scATAC-seq data with known cell labels, including 1 694 372 cells from Human  Mouse  Danio rerio  Zea mays and Arabidopsis thaliana  Moreover, scATAC-Ref also offers comprehensive downstream analysis results of scATAC-seq data, ncluding gene activity score, TF $z$ score, DAR, enriched pathway/GO erm and co-accessibility nteraction. On he basis of these analysis results, scATAC-Ref provides four search modes and an analysis function to help users flexibly understand and explore cell/ issue type-specific regulatory mechanisms from multiple perspectives. Overall, scATAC-Ref has significant advantages, particularly in terms of high-quality cell type labelling, species/cell types/ issues coverage and the ability to conduct useful downstream analyses. The scATACRef will facilitate for understanding the functional states and regulatory dynamics of various cell sub-populations in multiple species.

# ABSTRACT  

Dysregulation of RNA splicing contributes to both rare and complex diseases. RNA-sequencing data from human tissues has shown that this process can be inaccurate, resulting in the presence of novel introns detected at low frequency across samples and within an individual. To enable the full spectrum of intron use to be explored, we have developed IntroVerse, which offers an extensive catalogue on the splicing of 332,571 annotated introns and a linked set of 4,679,474 novel junctions covering 32,669 different genes. This dataset has been generated through the analysis of 17,510 human control RNA samples from 54 tissues provided by the Genotype-Tissue Expression Consortium. IntroVerse has two unique features: (i) it provides a complete catalogue of novel junctions and (ii) each novel junction has been assigned to a specific annotated intron. This unique, hierarchical structure offers multiple uses, including the identification of novel transcripts from known genes and their tissue-specific usage, and the assessment of background splicing noise for introns thought to be mis-spliced in disease states. IntroVerse provides a user-friendly web interface and is freely available at https://rytenlab.com/browser/app/ introverse.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Since the discovery of introns in 1977 (1,2), there has been increasing interest in splicing and, in particular, in alternative splicing as a means of generating transcriptomic diversity. In humans, it is now recognised that nearly all multiexon genes have multiple isoforms (3,4) and that dysregulation of splicing contributes to both rare and complex disease (5–7). Many of these insights have been gained using short-read RNA-sequencing data (8), which enables high throughput novel intron discovery by identifying reads which map with a gapped alignment to the genome, termed junction reads. To date, most RNA-sequencing splicing analyses have focused on identifying functionally important transcripts, their exons and usage, with an increasing interest in disease-specific applications as exemplified by RJunBase (9) (that offers an extended classification of splice junctions from non-cancerous and cancerous human samples). These priorities are reflected in existing splicing databases, which commonly filter splicing events based on their frequency, such that only a subset of introns thought to be part of stable transcripts are visible to the user (10–13) or do not provide a freely-available user-friendly web tool to browse and explore all detected novel junctions and their implied introns (14,15).  

However, the increasing depth and availability of large quantities of publicly accessible RNA-sequencing data have made clear that splicing errors are common $(16-$ 19), resulting in the consistent detection of partiallyunannotated junction reads at low frequency across samples and within individuals (19). Quantifying these errors, differentiating them from splicing events due to the presence of novel rare transcripts and identifying patterns in splicing variation have become increasingly important with the recognition of the role of splicing in ageing (DOI:10.1101/2022.03.14.484341), the use of RNAsequencing data to improve diagnostics (20) and the use of long-read RNA-sequencing data for discovery of rare transcripts (21). Despite this interest, there are no existing databases that allow the full spectrum of intron use to be explored.  

To bridge this gap, we created IntroVerse, which currently offers an extensive catalogue on the usage of 332,571 annotated introns and a linked set of 4,679,474 novel junctions and their implied novel introns covering 32,669 different genes. This data set was generated through the analysis of 17,510 human control RNA samples across 54 tissues provided by the Genotype-Tissue Expression Consortium v8 (22) and processed by recount3 (23). IntroVerse has two unique features: (i) it provides a complete catalogue of carefully processed and quality-controlled annotated introns and (ii) each novel junction (as implied by a novel split read) has been assigned to a specific annotated intron. The latter is key to the creation of a hierarchical database structure which allows the user to start by browsing a gene or genomic position of interest and end with an exploration of the entire catalogue of alternative splicing events. To enable users to prioritise annotated introns and novel junctions of greatest interest, we also provide complementary information on key parameters including: measures of splicing accuracy at each annotated intron, the percentage of individuals in which each splicing event has been observed, $5^{\circ}$ and $3^{\circ}$ sequence strength (24), sequence conservation (25) across primates in proximal intronic regions, sequence constraint (26) across humans in proximal intronic regions and mean read coverage. Furthermore, IntroVerse offers the user the opportunity to visualise novel junctions and their frequency within the main transcript structure, with the resulting plots downloadable in SVG format.  

IntroVerse has common use cases relevant to a range of user groups which include: (i) the assessment of background splicing noise for introns thought to be mis-spliced in disease states so aiding diagnosis of rare pathogenic splicing mutations and (ii) the identification of novel transcripts of known genes and their tissue-specific usage. Focusing on the latter, we note that in a single tissue, frontal cortex, we detected 2,048 novel junctions which are used in $>80\%$ of independent samples $N=167$ ) and which correspond to 1,420 genes suggesting the existence of incomplete annotation at these sites. Importantly, we found that the discovery of such sites was only weakly correlated with read coverage ( $R^{2}=3.7\mathrm{e}{-2}$ , $P$ -value $<2\mathrm{e}-16$ , Supplementary Figure S1). Thus, IntroVerse enables the efficient identification of genes for which existing transcriptome annotation is incomplete, providing key information to direct targeted analyses.  

IntroVerse does not require registration or login for access, and it is freely available for research use and data download from multiple devices, screen sizes and browsers at https://rytenlab.com/browser/app/introverse. IntroVerse is also available in docker format at https://hub.docker.com/ r/soniaruiz/introverse.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# GTEx v8 data collection and processing of split read data  

IntroVerse is based on RNA-sequencing data generated by the GTEx v8 (22) project. As such it includes data on 17,510 samples across 948 post-mortem donors and 54 tissues after accounting for the exclusion of samples that did not meet the minimum GTEx quality control criteria (gtex.smafrze $\mathbf{\tau}=$ 'EXCLUDE'; $\mathit{N}=\mathit{1},571$ ) (Figure 1, Figure 2). RNA-sequencing data from the project, which used the Illumina TruSeq library construction protocol (non-stranded 75 base pairs (bp) long reads, polyA $^+$ selection), was processed by recount3 using Monorail (23). The latter implements STAR (27) to align reads to the human genome (hg38/GRCh38) and summarise split reads (those mapping to the genome with a gapped alignment), and Megadepth (28) version 1.0.3 to analyse the BAM file outputs generated by STAR. We downloaded all split read data corresponding to GTEx v8 samples using the R package recount3 version 1.6.0.  

To identify split reads that were most likely to be generated through the activity of spliceosomes, we removed all reads whose implied intron length (defined by the gap in alignment to the genome) was less than 25 bp, the minimum length required for all essential splicing signals (29) (Figure 1). In order to increase the confidence in the spliceosome origin of these split reads, we discarded the reads located within unlocalized and unplaced (i.e. random) sequences, due to their inability to be located within the hg38 chromosomes 1–22 (chr1–chr22), X (chrX), Y (chrY) with a specific order and orientation. We also discarded all split reads that overlapped with any regions published within the ENCODE Blacklist (30) (Figure 1) as this list contains the DNA regions (hg38) where assembly had been difficult and, thus, their removal result in an essential quality measure.  

The split reads meeting these initial quality-control criteria were then annotated to the Ensembl v105 reference transcriptome by using the junction annot() function made available through the Bioconductor R package dasper (DOI:10.1101/2021.03.29.437534) version 1.4.3. Depending on the genomic coordinates of the split reads, these were classified by dasper into seven different junction categories: annotated, novel donor, novel acceptor, novel combo, novel exon skip, ambiguous and completely unannotated. Due to their unique ability to be linked to an annotated intron and, therefore, to a gene in annotation, we only considered reads classified as (i) ‘annotated’ junction reads, defined as split reads for which both ends of the implied intron precisely matched an intron within annotation, (ii) ‘novel donor’ junction reads, defined as split reads for which only the acceptor site precisely matched an intron-exon boundary within annotation and (iii) ‘novel acceptor’ junction reads, defined as split reads for which only the donor site precisely matched an exon-intron boundary within the annotation (Figure 1C). These three types of split read, henceforth referred to as annotated introns, novel donor and novel acceptor junctions, were incorporated into IntroVerse. The latter two categories, collectively referred to as novel junctions, implied the usage of novel introns.  

# Identification of mis-splicing events and their association to annotated introns  

By default, novel junctions meeting the criteria defined in GTEx v8 data collection and processing ofsplit read data, were considered to be products of mis-splicing events generated through the inaccurate excision of annotated introns (defined by Ensembl v105). While this definition of missplicing assumes that current transcriptome annotation is complete (which we recognise is not the case), it is important to note that the addition of novel introns into annotation has been plateauing for some time (14) making this a reasonable working assumption.

Figure 2. Data statistics and SQL Schema designed for IntroVerse. (A) Sample count by tissue. Each bar represents the number of samples per body site considered in IntroVerse. (B) Database summary statistics. (C) SQL schema design for IntroVerse. The table ‘annotated intron’ corresponds to the table ‘intron’ in the SQLite schema, and the table ‘novel junction’ refers to the table ‘novel’ in the SQLite schema.  

Next, to enable the identification of mis-splicing events, we started by assigning each novel donor and acceptor junction to a known annotated intron through sharing of their single annotated splice site (Figure 3B). To increase confidence in junction pairing, we ensured that each novel junction was only paired to an annotated intron if there was also evidence for use of that specific annotated intron in every sample in which the novel junction was found, as defined by the presence of $\geq1$ annotated junction read in each sample. In total, 730,125 novel donor and acceptor junctions were discarded from this project as there was not any compatible annotated intron meeting the aforementioned criteria to pair them with among the set of samples studied.  

Since we considered mis-splicing to be the result of the inaccurate excision of annotated introns, a novel junction could only be the result of the mis-splicing of a single unique intron, regardless of the sample or body site in which the novel event had been found. Consequently, all novel donor and acceptor junctions able to be paired to multiple annotated introns within a sample or across samples, were considered ambiguous and discarded from this project. This resulted in the discard of 346,419 ambiguous novel junctions and 17,906 annotated introns that were uniquely parenting them, with none of them included in IntroVerse. In total, 1,094,450 annotated introns and novel junctions were excluded from IntroVerse (Figure 1).  

# Quantifying the levels of mis-splicing at an annotated intron using the mis-splicing ratio measure  

To determine the mis-splicing rate for any annotated intron across samples of a given tissue, we generated a measure, which we termed the mis-splicing ratio $(M S R)$ . Two $M S R$ values were calculated for each annotated intron to provide a measure of the frequency of mis-splicing at the donor $(M S R_{D})$ and acceptor splice sites $(M S R_{A})$ separately.  

The $M S R_{D}$ and $M S R_{A}$ measures for a given annotated intron were calculated by first summing together all novel donor and novel acceptor junction read counts respectively that were attached to the annotated intron across all samples of the tissue, and then dividing that value by the sum of all annotated intron and novel junction read counts across the same set of samples. Focusing on the $M S R_{D}$ measure, this can be formally described as below:  

$$
\mathit{M S R}_{D}^{X}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}j_{i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}j_{i}+\sum_{i=1}^{N}s_{i}}
$$  

Let $j$ denote the total number of novel donor junction reads assigned to the annotated intron $X$ within one sample of our study set. Let $s$ denote the total number of annotated junction reads for the same intron, $X,$ within the same sample of our study set. Let $N$ denote the total number of samples studied within our study set.  

We then mirrored the formula above to produce the $M S R_{A}$ measure.  

Both $M S R_{D}$ and $M S R_{A}$ values were calculated per annotated intron across the samples of each tissue, and ranged between 0 and 1. Whereas 0 value represented accurate splicing at the donor or acceptor site of the annotated intron of interest as compared to the reference transcriptome Ensembl v105, 1 value represented complete mis-splicing of the splice site. This adaptation of the method for normalisation of library sizes (31) accounted for variability in expression and read depth across different genes and introns, enabling the comparison of mis-splicing activity across introns.  

It is important to note that both $M S R_{D}$ and $M S R_{A}$ scores were only calculated when there was evidence of the annotated intron being detected within the tissue as defined by the presence of $\geq~1$ supporting split reads. Given that some transcripts are not expressed in all tissues, the corresponding annotated introns would not be detected, and so the $M S R_{D}$ and $M S R_{A}$ values were not calculated. In fact, the median number of annotated introns across tissues as stored on IntroVerse corresponds to 239,839 and ranges from 187,551 to 279,156 annotated introns (Supplementary Table S1).  

# Database generation  

All annotated introns, and their related novel donor and acceptor junctions, were classified by tissue and stored within tables in a relational database that was named IntroVerse. To build this database, we used the SQLite R package version 2.2.7 (Figure 3C). All annotated introns in all tissues were stored within a master table called ‘intron’, whereas all novel donor and novel acceptor junctions were stored together within another master table called ‘novel’. These two master tables were related with a cardinality of $1{:}N_{:}$ , meaning that each annotated intron could be paired with multiple novel junctions, whereas each novel junction could only be paired with a single, unique annotated intron. An additional master table was created to store information about all genes from which the annotated introns originated. Two child tables were then generated per GTEx tissue and contained: (i) all novel junctions found across samples of each tissue and paired with an intron in annotation and (ii) all annotated introns that showed accurate splicing activity (defined by Ensembl v105) across the samples of the studied tissue (Figure 2C).  

Multiple intron- and gene-level features were incorporated as columns to the master tables of the IntroVerse database:  

# a. Intron-level properties:  

i. The intron length (in base pairs).   
ii. The strength of the $5^{\circ}$ or $3^{\circ}$ splicing signals as generated by the MaxEntScan (24) score (MES) algorithm. This method uses probabilistic models of sequence motifs involved in RNA splicing and their adjacent positions to score the 9 bp sequence at the $5^{\circ}$ splice site and the 23 bp sequence at the $3^{\circ}$ splice site. The higher the maximum entropy score assigned to

Figure 3. Overall design and construction of IntroVerse. (A) Summary of data collection and processing. (B) Summary of the process used for annotated intron and novel junction pairing. ‘AnnotatedSS’ refers to annotated splice site and ‘novelSS’ refers to novel splice site.

(D) Visualisation of a novel junction and the mis-splicing activity occurring within the MANE transcript of a selected gene using ggtranscript (35).  

a given sequence, the more closely the sequence evaluated corresponds to an annotated splice site.  

iii. The mean inter-species conservation (25) score across primates assigned to the $5^{\circ}$ and $3^{\circ}$ proximal exon-intron junction regions. The $5^{\circ}$ proximal region was defined as 5 bp upstream of the $5^{\circ}$ splice site to 35 bp into the downstream intron. The $3^{\circ}$ proximal region was defined as 35 bp upstream of the $3^{\circ}$ splice site to $5~\mathrm{bp}$ into the downstream exon (Figure 1B). This score was calculated by obtaining the mean of the phastCons20 scores (http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/ hg38/phastCons20way/) assigned to each proximal intronic region and represents the probability of negative selection based on the number of substitutions occurring during evolution across primates. The mean phastCons20 score ranges between 0 and 1, with a value of 0 meaning that the sequence is poorly conserved and 1 that the sequence is highly conserved.  

iv. The mean context-dependent tolerance score (CDTS) (26) assigned to the $5^{\circ}$ and $3^{\circ}$ proximal exon-intron junction regions (Figure 1B). The CDTS score provides a measure of sequence constraint across individuals. This score ranges between -1 and 1, with negative values indicating regions of the human genome which have the lowest sequence variation across individuals.  

v. The maximum Transcript Support Level (TSL) assigned to the set of transcripts in which the annotated intron appears. This field can present one of the following values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and tslNA. An intron with a $\mathrm{TSL}=1 $ value means that it has been found within a set of transcripts whose model presents the highest support available. On the contrary, an intron with a $\mathrm{T}\mathrm{S}\mathrm{L}\ =\ 5$ value means that it has been found within a set of transcripts with a poorly supported model structure. $\mathrm{\DeltaTSL~=~\ts2NA.}$ , means that none of the transcript structures in which the intron has been found is analysed (https://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/ genebuild/transcript quality tags.html).  

vi. Whether the annotated intron is likely to be spliced out from the pre-mRNA molecule by the major (column ‘u2 intron $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}\mathbf{T}^{\dagger}.$ ) or minor spliceosome assembly (column $\`_{\mathrm{{u}1}2.\mathrm{{intron}=\mathrm{{\OmegaT}^{\prime})}}}$ . This data was obtained from The Intron Annotation and Orthology Database (IAOD) (32). When these two columns are set to a FALSE value, it represents an annotated intron that was not categorised within the IAOD database.  

b. Gene-level properties. It has been reported that the number of introns within a gene or its level of expression can affect the fitness cost of splicing errors (33). With this in mind, some gene-level properties have been incorporated into IntroVerse.  

i. The gene length (in base pairs).   
ii. The number of annotated transcripts assigned to the gene based on Ensembl v105.   
iii. The median gene expression level (TPM) across all samples from each tissue and calculated using the getTPM()function from the R recount Bioconductor package version 1.22.0.   
iv. The percentage of protein-coding transcripts in which each annotated intron was found. This percentage can be unreliable when a gene has many transcripts with low TSL values.   
v. Yes/no boolean value to confirm whether the intron of interest forms part of a Matched Annotation from NCBI and EMBL-EBI (MANE) (34) Select transcript.  

The columns of the child tables contain information about the splicing activity of the annotated introns and novel junctions detected in each tissue:  

# a. Annotated introns:  

i. The rate of mis-splicing at donor and acceptor splice sites of the annotated intron as calculated by the $M S R_{D}$ and $M S R_{A}$ measures, which range between 0 and 1. Focusing on the $M S R_{D}$ measure, a $M S R_{D}=$ 0 value represents accurate splicing at the $5^{\circ}$ splice site of the intron across all samples of the tissue studied, whereas a $M S R_{D}=1$ value would represent complete mis-splicing at that splice site. It is worth noting that the $M S R$ metrics do not convey information about the certainty in the measure of mis-splicing, since annotated introns with low or high read coverage can generate similar MSR values. With this in mind, the reader should consider additional metrics provided by IntroVerse such as the percentage of samples in which the intron was found and its mean coverage.   
ii. The percentage of samples of a given tissue in which the annotated intron was used, as defined by $\geq1$ annotated read count in the sample.   
iii. The mean number of annotated reads counts assigned to the annotated intron across all the samples.  

# b. Novel junctions:  

i. The intron length in base pairs implied by the novel junction.   
ii. The percentage of samples of a given tissue in which the novel junction was used, as defined by $\geq1$ novel junction read in the sample.   
iii. The mean number of novel junction reads across all samples from a given tissue in which the novel junction was detected.   
iv. The distance in base pairs between the genomic position of the unannotated splice site of the novel junction and the annotated acceptor/donor splice site of its paired annotated intron.   
v. Whether the novel junction is capable of causing a frameshift. This value has been calculated by obtaining the modulo 3 of the distance in base pairs lying between the genomic position of the unannotated splice site of the novel junction and the acceptor/donor splice site of its paired annotated intron. When the reminder of this division by 3 (i.e. modulo 3) returns a value of 1 or 2, it indicates that the excision of the novel intron would be capable of causing a frameshift.  

vi. The strength of the $5^{\circ}$ and $3^{\circ}$ splicing signals implied by the novel junction, as calculated by the MaxEntScan (24) score algorithm.  

# Web interface implementation  

A ShinyApp website was built and it uses the data stored in the IntroVerse SQLite database. The IntroVerse website was deployed using a Linux-based Apache/2.4.6 Web server running on a Docker container version 18.09.0 over a CentOS Linux release 7.5.1804 (Core) server. ShinyProxy (https://www.shinyproxy.io/) was used as a proxy to allow multiple users to access IntroVerse simultaneously and to provide a fully isolated workspace per R session. Different in-house R scripts (DOI:10.5281/zenodo.6869186) were used to query the IntroVerse SQLite object from the IntroVerse Shiny app and return the information requested within a user-friendly format. Visualisation of the novel junctions as well as the mis-splicing activity occurring within the MANE Select transcript of a particular gene was made available through the use of the R package ggtranscript (35) version 0.99.9. The IntroVerse website was built using numerous client-side languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery) and libraries (JQuery.js, DataTable.js), as well as the Bootstrap version 4 framework (https: //getbootstrap.com/), which helped to enhance the look and feel of the user-interface and the user experience by supporting multiple devices, browsers and screen sizes. The IntroVerse website does not require registration or login for access and is freely available for research use and data download at https://rytenlab.com/browser/app/introverse. Finally, IntroVerse can also be downloaded as a docker image from https://hub.docker.com/r/soniaruiz/introverse.  

# RESULTS  

# Database content and statistics  

We analysed 17,510 RNA-sequencing samples across 54 human tissues from GTEx v8 (22) with a median of 248 samples per tissue (ranging between 4 and 805 samples). All the split reads obtained from this dataset were annotated to the Ensembl v105 reference transcriptome. Of the split reads that passed the quality-control criteria (Figure 1C), we identified a total of 332,571 annotated introns of which 294,050 had evidence of at least one type of mis-splicing event, namely the use of a novel donor or novel acceptor junction in at least one of the 17,510 samples studied. The remaining 38,521 annotated introns corresponding to 14,395 genes within the database $44.06\%$ of all genes analysed) had no evidence of mis-splicing across all tissues and samples processed (Figure 2B). Interestingly, of these 14,395 genes, we found that 10,081 were protein-coding and 3,584 were lncRNAs (with the remaining 730 being a mixture of other gene biotypes). Given that relatively few lncRNAs have known biological functions, this finding might suggest that IntroVerse could be used to identify the most important genes of this type. In fact, this view is supported by the finding that introns within lncRNA genes are more frequently misspliced at both the donor (Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction, effect-size $=2.8\mathrm{e}{-2}$ , $P$ -value $<2.2\mathrm{e}-16$ )  

and acceptor splice sites (Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction, effect-size $=3.03\mathrm{e}{-2}$ , $P_{\l}$ -value $<2.2\mathrm{e}-16\$ than introns within protein-coding genes even after controlling for differences in read coverage (Supplementary Figure S2). Therefore, when we identify lncRNAs which are perfectly spliced this could indicate a specific requirement for efficient degradation of mis-splicing events at this locus. With this in mind, we noted that the mouse homologue of the gene, FENDRR, a lncRNA containing multiple introns with no evidence of mis-splicing across samples from all tissues analysed, when knocked out results in postnatal lethality with defects in the lung, gastrointestinal tract and heart in Fendrr / neonates (36). Furthermore, since its essential role in mouse development was identified, FENDRR has also been implicated in multiple human cancers, supporting the utility of IntroVerse in prioritising lncRNAs for investigation (37).  

IntroVerse includes information on 1,950,821 novel donor and 2,728,653 novel acceptor junctions, which are confidently paired with the 294,050 annotated introns presenting evidence of at least one type of mis-splicing event across all tissues (Figure 2B). To summarise this data and provide a measure of mis-splicing across each annotated intron, we provide users with the measures, $M S R_{D}$ and $M S R_{A}$ . Focusing on samples from frontal cortex tissue, the median $M S R_{D}$ corresponded to 5e- $4\ [0-0.99]$ , whereas the median $M S R_{A}$ was 1.3e-3 [0 0.99], though it is noteworthy that in both cases the modal values were zero indicating that splicing is largely accurate. Considering all tissues, the median $M S R_{D}$ was 8e-4 and the median $M S R_{A}$ was $1.7\mathrm{e}\mathrm{-}$ 3, indicating that mis-splicing at the acceptor splice site is more common than that at the donor.  

# Web interface and usage  

IntroVerse is a user-friendly and comprehensive website that allows users to browse and explore the characteristics of 332,571 annotated introns belonging to 32,669 different genes. The IntroVerse website consists of three major modules that allow users to (i) obtain information on the key characteristics and splicing accuracy of annotated introns across samples within each of the 54 GTEx v8 tissues, (ii) obtain information on the overall usage of novel junctions associated with an annotated intron of interest at both the donor and acceptor sites separately, and across each of the 54 GTEx tissues, and iii) visualise novel junctions and the rate of mis-splicing at donor and acceptor splice sites of annotated introns within the Matched Annotation from NCBI and EMBL-EBI (MANE) Select transcript (34) of a selected gene, and display it across all samples from a single or multiple tissues.  

Intron search. To search for an annotated intron in IntroVerse within a tissue of interest, users can query the database by (i) introducing the coordinates of an annotated intron of interest (‘by intron coordinates’), (ii) selecting a gene symbol or gene ID from the dropdown list provided (‘by gene’) and (iii) uploading a gene list of interest (‘by gene list’) (Figure 4A-1, Figure 4B-1). The latter requires the user to upload a .csv file containing one single column with headers and a gene symbol or gene Ensembl ID per row. An example gene list is also provided. In all three cases, the information returned by IntroVerse consists of a table in which every entry represents an annotated intron in the reference transcriptome (Ensembl v105), with columns providing a range of key features about the annotated intron (see Materials and Methods, Database generation) and an additional blue button to show the mis-splicing activity attached to the intron (Figure 4B-3).

(B) The displayed columns of the intron table correspond to: (i) ID, the unique identifier of the intron; (ii) Mis-spliced site, the splice site of the intron that has been mis-spliced if any; (iii) Intron Length, which represents the length of the intron in base pairs (bp); (iv) MES 5ss, the strength of the $5^{\circ}$ (i.e. donor) splicing signal through the use of the MaxEntScan score algorithm; (v) Gene, the gene to which the intron belongs to; (vi) Samples, cluster of samples in which the intron search has been performed; (vii) More, button ‘Show Alternative Splicing Events’ to show the mis-splicing activity attached to the intron. (C) The columns of the novel junction table correspond to: (i) NovelID, the unique identifier of the novel junction; (ii) Novel Type, type of novel event, classified as ‘novel donor’ or ‘novel acceptor’; (iii) Junction Length (bp), implied intron length of the novel junction in base pairs; (iv) MES 5ss, the strength of the $5^{\circ}$ (i.e. donor) splicing signal through the use of the MaxEntScan score algorithm; (v) MES 3ss, the strength of the $3^{\circ}$ (i.e. acceptor) splicing signal through the use of the MaxEntScan score algorithm; (vi) Distance (bp), distance in base pairs between the novel junction and the paired annotated intron; (vii) More, button ‘Visualise in MANE transcript’ to display the graphical representation of the novel junction within the MANE transcript of the gene. (D) Visualisation of a novel donor event within the MANE transcript of a selected gene. Graphs can be downloaded in SVG format. (E) Visualisation of the mis-splicing activity occurring in all annotated introns within the MANE transcript of the selected gene. By clicking on the tab ‘Download’, it is possible to download the complete IntroVerse SQLite database.  

IntroVerse also provides an advanced search section which enables the user to refine the query further. First, the ‘Sample Selection’ section (Figure 4A-2) allows the user to determine whether the annotated intron search should be done across one single tissue, multiple tissues or ‘All tissues’. This latter will produce an intron query across all 17,510 samples from the 54 human GTEx tissues processed. Second, the ‘Support for novel annotation’ section (Figure 4A3), contains a checkbox and a numeric range that filters the results to only show the annotated introns associated with at least one alternative splicing event shared across the minimum number of samples selected through the numeric range. This search is based on the hypothesis that for any novel junction to be indicative of the presence of a novel stable transcript (rather than mis-splicing), it should be shared across a high number of unrelated individuals. More specifically, we consider mis-splicing to be a random process making the likelihood of excising the same novel junction with the identical genomic positions across multiple unrelated individuals very low. Consequently, a specific novel junction that is detected across a high number of individuals (e.g. $\geq90\%$ ) is more likely to be generated through a deliberate (non-random) process and to be of biological interest. Third, the ‘AdditionalFilters’ section (Figure 4A-4), provides two search refinements: (i) the ‘Introns with ClinVar mutations’ checkbox will only retrieve annotated introns that have been reported to contain at least one pathogenic or likely pathogenic splicing variant as defined within the ClinVar archive (38) and (ii) the ‘Introns from MANE Select transcripts’ checkbox will only report the introns from genes with a protein-coding transcript classified as MANE (34) in the reference annotation.  

Mis-splicing search. All alternative splicing events that are associated with an annotated intron of interest can be retrieved by clicking the blue button ‘Show Alternative Splicing Events’ located at the end of every row of the annotated Intron table (Figure 4B-3, Figure 4C-1). Clicking this button will automatically hide all rows except those selected and will result in the display of an additional table consisting of all alternative splicing events paired with the annotated intron of interest. In this second table, every entry represents a unique alternative splicing as identified through novel junctions. The columns provide key information about the novel event itself (see Materials and Methods, Database generation), and an additional button ‘Visualise in MANE transcript’ (Figure 4C-2) which when clicked will trigger a popup window with the graphical representation of the novel junction within the MANE transcript of the gene (Figure 4D). This visualisation will highlight the related novel donor (blue) or novel acceptor junctions (red) within the gene’s MANE (34) transcript.  

Gene mis-splicing visualisation. IntroVerse provides the option to visualise mis-splicing rates across all annotated introns contained within the MANE transcript of a gene of interest (Figure 4E-1) in a given tissue. The mis-splicing rate as defined by the $M S R_{D}$ and the $M S R_{A}$ values are represented by blue and red vertical bars respectively located at the $5^{\circ}$ splice $(M S R_{D})$ or $3^{\circ}$ splice sites $(M S R_{A})$ . Since $M S R_{D}$ and $M S R_{A}$ are normalised to range between a value of 0 and 1, the higher the vertical bar displayed, the higher the proportion of novel junction reads paired to the annotated intron at that splice site. This visualisation allows the user to quickly identify annotated introns within the MANE transcript that are most frequently mis-spliced across samples of single or multiple tissues, with the latter enabling the identification of tissue-specific mis-splicing activity.  

# Data download and visualisation  

IntroVerse provides functionality for both data download and visualisation purposes. Data tables containing annotated introns and novel junctions can be fully downloaded in PDF, CSV, Excel and Text formats (Figure 4B-4, Figure 4C-3). Depending on the table selected, every entry will represent either an annotated intron or a novel junction, and the columns will contain key information about each feature (see Materials and Methods, Database generation) with the user being able to select only a subset of features as required. Data visualisation is provided for novel junctions as well as for mis-splicing activity across all annotated introns within the MANE transcript of a selected gene. Visualisation for novel junctions can be downloaded in SVG format (Figure 4D-1). The complete SQLite database can be downloaded directly from the user interface of IntroVerse along with other useful resources such as the SQL schema and a set of handy SQL queries (Figure 4E-2). The IntroVerse database has been carefully designed to be highly efficient such that the entire database currently occupies less than 3GB.  

# APPLICATIONS  

IntroVerse has multiple use cases and some of them are listed below:  

1. The assessment of background levels of mis-splicing amongst control individuals within introns thought to be mis-spliced in disease states. We found that introns containing pathogenic or likely pathogenic splice site mutations (as defined within ClinVar, https://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/variation/view) have significantly lower $M S R_{D}$ (Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction, effect-size $=5.78\mathrm{e}{-2}$ , $P$ -value $<2.2\mathrm{e}-16)$ and ${M S R}_{A}$ (Wilcoxon rank sum test with continuity correction, effect-size $=6.74\mathrm{e}{-2}$ , $P$ -value $<2.2\mathrm{e}-16\$ ) values across all tissues than other annotated introns not containing any ClinVar variant after controlling for mean read coverage (Supplementary Figure S3). This suggests that, in control individuals, annotated introns containing pathogenic variants are spliced with particularly high accuracy.  

2. Identification of novel transcripts of known genes and their tissue-specific usage: Using samples from frontal cortex tissue, we detected 2,048 novel junctions corresponding to 1,420 genes which are used in $>80\%$ of samples $N=167$ ), suggesting the existence of incomplete annotation at these specific sites. Importantly, we found that the discovery of such sites was only weakly correlated with read coverage over the annotated intron $R^{2}=3.7\mathrm{e}\mathrm{-}2$ , $P$ -value $<2\mathrm{e}-16$ , Supplementary Figure S1). Furthermore, by using the filter ‘Support for novel annotation’, which is available on the main user interface of IntroVerse, we noted that of all green genes $N=121$ ) causally implicated in hereditary ataxia (as defined in PanelApp Version 1.303, https://panelapp. genomicsengland.co.uk/), $17\%$ $N=21$ ) contain novel junctions which are used $\mathrm{in}\geq80\%$ of cerebellar samples $N=217$ ).  

3. Integration of short- and long-read RNA-sequencing data to support novel transcript discovery: Using untargeted long-read RNA-sequencing data provided by the ENCODE project and relating to $\Nu=16$ samples of the human heart (Supplementary Table S2), we identified all novel junctions absent from Ensembl v105. Of the 611 unique novel junctions found across all sixteen ENCODE samples, we found that 349 were also detected in GTEx v8 left ventricle and atrial appendage heart tissues as stored in IntroVerse. Furthermore, these 342 novel junctions were detected in a median of 353 left ventricle and atrial appendage GTEx samples suggesting that the full-length transcripts from which they are derived are likely to be novel transcripts of known genes.  

across the lifespan and derived from individuals with major neuropsychiatric disorders. With the increasing availability of untargeted long-read RNA-sequencing data, we will also expand the annotation of novel junctions within IntroVerse to flag when a junction is also identified within public long-read RNA-sequencing data and the related fulllength transcript/s. These future updates will increase the value of IntroVerse and broaden its applications.  

Thus, IntroVerse provides users with structured data on intron usage across a wide range of human tissues which can be used in a range of downstream analyses to improve our understanding of the role of splicing in health and disease.  

# DATA AVAILABILITY  

IntroVerse is a user-friendly and comprehensive website that is fed from an SQLite database containing the splicing activity of 332,571 annotated introns found across 17,510 RNA-sequencing samples from 54 control tissues. The complete SQLite database is available to be downloaded directly from the user interface of IntroVerse, as it has been carefully designed to be highly efficient such that the entire database currently only occupies less than 3GB.  

IntroVerse is available for data-querying and download purposes at https://rytenlab.com/browser/app/introverse. Multiple in-house R scripts have been created to query the IntroVerse SQLite object from the IntroVerse Shiny app, as well as to build the latter. These scripts are freely available on GitHub (DOI:10.5281/zenodo.6869186).  

Finally, IntroVerse is also available in docker formatting at https://hub.docker.com/r/soniaruiz/introverse.  

# DISCUSSION  

IntroVerse provides quality-controlled information on the splicing of 332,571 annotated introns from 32,669 different genes across 17,510 RNA-sequencing samples and 54 human control tissues. IntroVerse has two unique features: (i) it provides a complete and unfiltered catalogue of novel junctions that have been carefully processed and qualitycontrolled and (ii) each novel junction has been assigned to a specific annotated intron, which provides a hierarchical structure allowing the user to start by browsing a gene or genomic position of interest and to end with an exploration of the complete catalogue of alternative events occurring at that locus. In addition, IntroVerse allows users to browse, download and compare key genomic parameters either across introns of a particular gene and sample of interest or across multiple genes, samples and human tissues. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, IntroVerse is the only database that enables the visualisation of alternative splicing events by i) displaying individual events in the context of the gene’s MANE transcript and ii) the overall frequency of alternative splicing of each annotated intron of the gene’s MANE transcript.  

Future versions of this database will include additional human RNA-sequencing data sets generated from individuals with disease, in addition to controls. More specifically, we will include data provided by the BrainSEQ Consortium Phase I and II projects (39–41), which have generated RNAsequencing data from more than 700 human brain samples

# ABSTRACT  

tRNAs have been widely studied for their role as genetic code decoders in the ribosome during translation, but have recently received new attention due to the discovery of novel roles beyond decoding, often in connection with human diseases. Yet, existing tRNA databases have not been updated for more than a decade, so they do not contain this new functional information and have not kept pace with the rate of discovery in this field. Therefore, a regularly updated database that contains information about newly discovered characteristics of tRNA molecules and can be regularly updated is strongly needed. Here, we report the creation of the T-psi-C database (http://tpsic.igcz.poznan.pl), an up-to-date collection of tRNA sequences that contains data obtained from high-throughput tRNA sequencing, e.g. all isoacceptors and isodecoders for human HEK293 cells. This database also contains 3D tRNA structures obtained from Protein Data Bank and generated using homology modeling. The T-psi-C database can be continuously updated by any member of the scientific community, and contains its own application programming interface (API), which allows users to retrieve or upload data in JSON format. Altogether, T-psi-C is user-friendly, easy to develop and an upto-date source of knowledge about tRNAs.  

# INTRODUCTION  

The role of tRNAs as genetic code decoders has been widely studied since the mid-1950s, and is well understood (for a review, see (1)). Currently, the tRNA research field is experiencing a renaissance, and much of this interest has focused on the tissue-specific regulation of translation decoding efficiency, due to expression level changes and/or nucleoside modification, which are often connected with human disease. For example, changes in tRNA isoacceptor (tRNA with distinct anticodon sequences loaded with the same amino acid) and/or isodecoder (the same anticodon sequence, but differences in tRNA body) expression levels may dramatically influence cell physiology, and in breast cancer cells, high expression of tRNAGlu/UUC and tRNAArg/CCG isoacceptors causes a shift from normal protein expression towards an expression profile that promotes metastasis (2). Similarly, downregulation of one of the five tRNAArg/UCU isodecoders, which is important for neuronal homeostasis, causes neurodegeneration (3). Additionally, several human diseases are associated with a lack of modified nucleosides that are normally present in particular tRNAs (for a review, see (4)). Finally, over 200 mutations in human mitochondrial genes encoding tRNAs have been identified as being associated with various human pathologies, such as myopathy, hearing loss, encephalopathy or gastrointestinal dysmotility (for reviews, see (5,6)). Therefore, there is a tremendous amount of new information that incorporates diverse aspects of tRNAs, such as sequences, structures, nucleoside modifications and isoacceptor and isodecoder expression levels, that is currently available in the scientific literature. Yet, this new information has not, been compiled into a single, up-to-date source or database.  

Currently, two main databases are used by tRNA researchers: tRNAdb (7) and GtRNAdb (8,9). Starting from late 1970s a concerted effort was made to collect all known tRNA sequences in one place and to analyze structural and functional relationships between them (10–12). The result of this effort was the ‘Compilation of tRNA sequences’ database that was systematically updated by the creators, and made available as downloadable MS-Excel spreadsheets (13). In 2009, the database was transferred to a MySQL webpage (http://trnadb.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de) (7), updated to include several improvements (such as a user-friendly interface) and renamed tRNAdb. However, no new tRNA sequences have been added to this database since 2007, which means that several tRNA sequences obtained after this date, including all derived from highthroughput RNA-Seq methods are missed in tRNAdb. Another tRNA database––genomic tRNA Database (GtRNAdb, recently in version 2.0) (http://gtrnadb.ucsc.edu/) (8,9) contains tRNA predictions based on complete or nearly complete genomes. Nonetheless, the annotation process of this database is automated, and new entries are not checked for agreement with the published literature. Prediction is made at the genomic level. For the organisms with unknown tRNA expression profiles GtRNAdb data require further experimental validation to confirm expression of particular tRNA.  

Importantly, in addition to their other limitations, neither of these databases contains structural information about tRNA molecules. At present, this information can only be retrieved from general structural databases, primarily the Protein Data Bank (PDB), and while many solved tRNA structures are available in PDB, the majority were obtained in complex with one or multiple proteins. This makes extracting tRNA structures from PDB files challenging because it requires specialized knowledge about PDB file structure, including programming skills that may be nonintuitive and problematic for an inexperienced user.  

Here, we present the T-psi-C database (http://tpsic.igcz. poznan.pl), which contains sequences of tRNA molecules from organisms and viruses obtained by several methods of tRNA sequencing. It also includes their 2D and in most cases 3D structures as well as information about modified nucleosides. T-psi-C database offers three major advantages over previous tRNA databases: (i) an updated set of tRNA sequences, including data from high-throughput techniques; (ii) 3D structures of tRNA molecules retrieved from PDB or 3D structural models generated by homology modeling; (iii) the capacity for continuous updating with newly obtained tRNA sequences and structures by any member of the scientific community. We expect that this database will serve as a valuable resource for the scientific community, including molecular biologists, crystallographers, geneticists, chemists, computational biologists and others as the pace of tRNA research continues to increase, and we uncover new roles for these multifunctional molecules.  

# DATABASE CONTENT  

T-psi-C is manually curated collection of tRNA sequences and structures. Importantly, it contains sequences obtained from RNA sequencing and not from computational prediction based on genomic sequences. tRNA sequences present in the tRNAdb, except for computationally predicted ‘tRNA genes’ (7), were imported into T-psi-C. Sequences were corrected, if necessary, based on recently published literature, e.g., several modified nucleosides were added in the place of an unknown modification, 2D structures of selenocysteine tRNAs were re-aligned according to the recent structural data. A literature search was performed to add tRNA sequences published in the last decade as well as sequences that were published earlier, but were not present in tRNAdb. Finally T-psi-C database contain 1030 tRNA sequences.  

The recent development of high-throughput RNA sequencing, including hydro-tRNAseq technology, has allowed the sequences of the entire tRNA transcriptomes of fission yeast (14) and human HEK293 cells (15) to be obtained. Therefore, the T-psi-C database contains 251 sequences based on hydro-tRNAseq. In the near future, we plan to add data from high-throughput methods other than hydro-tRNAseq, such as ARM-Seq (16), DM-tRNA-seq (17), YAMAT-seq (18) and mim-tRNAseq (19).  

Structural data retrieved from Protein Data Bank and generated by homology modeling were also incorporated into T-psi-C. First, PDB was searched to obtain all tRNA structures. In a second step, tRNA 3D structures were extracted from tRNA-protein complexes and tRNA sequences were retrieved from 3D structures using RNApdbee (20,21). Sequences retrieved from structural data were compared with those present in T-psi-C database. If the sequence was present in the T-psi-C database, 3D structural data were added to the sequence record. If a particular sequence was absent (46 cases), it was retrieved from the 3D structure and added to T-psi-C along with the structural data. If 3D structures were not available, structural models for majority of sequences were generated using ModeRNA (22,23), followed in most cases by MMTK (dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/MMTK.html) for energy minimization, and the resulting structures were entered into T-psi-C. Thus, for 899 from 1030 tRNA molecules present in T-psiC, the sequence as well as the 3D structure can be retrieved.  

A comparison between the content of T-psi-C and existing tRNA databases is shown in Table 1.  

# DATABASE ORGANIZATION AND FUNCTIONALITIES  

The core of the T-psi-C database was created using the MySQL, Django framework with the Django Rest Framework and Python programing language.  

A user-friendly search interface was designed to allow easy and rapid retrieval of interesting data. In addition to ‘tRNA ID’, ‘tRNA type’, ‘Organism name’, ‘coding AA’ and ‘Anticodon sequence’, the database can also be searched using the sequence or 2D structure as a query.  

For sequence searching, two different approaches were implemented: (i) the very rapid and efficient Elasticsearch (https://www.elastic.co/) approach using the n-gram model and (ii) the commonly used BLAST approach (BLAST $^+$ version 2.7.1) (24). In the case of the n-gram model, many more results are displayed; however, the score generated by Elasticsearch enables easy selection of significant results, which are displayed as a list of individual records. Moreover, Elasticsearch-based implementation allows a direct search for modified sequences, which is not supported by BLAST. On the other hand results of the BLAST search represent only significant hits together with sequence alignment. The search results are displayed as a list of individual records.

For all records, the ID system from tRNAdb 2009 was retained, with the prefixes ‘tdbR’ and ‘tdbPDB’ added for records obtained from sequencing and structural data, respectively.  

# THE DATABASE RECORD  

Each individual database record represents a unique tRNA molecule from a particular species/organ/cell line. Each record contains information about the organism, amino acid specificity, tRNA cellular origin (cytoplasmic, mitochondrial, plastid or viral) and anticodon sequence. Each record also contains a full tRNA sequence with unmodified nucleosides––a so-called ‘flat sequence’, a secondary structure in dot-bracket format and sequence and secondary structure pre-aligned to the universal tRNA template. For some records, additional information is given in the ‘Comments’ field. Bibliographic information for the publication from which a sequence/structure is derived is given in the ‘Publications’ field, with a links to source publications in PubMed.  

The 2D structure is depicted in the cloverleaf form, generated using custom-made JavaScript code, and displays nucleotides at sites specified by XML generated by TRAVeLer (25). Clicking on a modified nucleoside in the 2D structure displays a MODOMICS (26) cross-reference containing more details about that particular modification. Due to the large number of modified nucleosides, they are identified within the 2D sequence using the MODOMICS abbreviation system (http://modomics.genesilico.pl/modifications/), which is an extension of the ASCII-based system used in tRNAdb.  

Folding free energy was calculated for each tRNA secondary structure using ViennaRNA (RNAlib-2.4.14) (https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/ViennaRNA/doc/html/ wrappers.html).  

The 3D structure is depicted using a Jmol applet (27), allowing for zooming and rotating. The 3D structures can be downloaded in PDB format. For structural data retrieved from PDB, PDB IDs and cross-references to the PDB database are given.  

Representative record is showed in Figure 1.  

# ADDING NEW RECORDS AND DATA RETRIEVAL  

Users can add new entries to the T-psi-C via the ‘add new entry’ option once they have registered for an account.  

The registered user then completes the form, including the PubMed ID of the publication containing information about the tRNA sequence/structure, for verification purposes. There is requirement that publication contains information how the published sequence was obtained, including experimental details and computational pipeline, if necessary. Detailed guidelines for adding new records can be found at http://tpsic.igcz.poznan.pl/info/add-entry/. Upon positive verification ensuring that a particular sequence does not exist in the database and if the user provided data are in agreement with data in publication, the record will be publicly displayed. If structural data is not provided by the user, a 3D structure will be generated automatically by homology modeling. The T-psi-C database contains its own application programming interface (API) that allows registered users to retrieve or upload data in JSON format. The use of this API is highly recommended in the case of future integration with other tools.  

# DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS  

The T-psi-C database assembles several layers of information about tRNAs. This information includes sequences, secondary and tertiary structures and modifications. T-psiC provides user-friendly interface with sequence and 2D structure search and rapid retrieval and download of interesting data. However, for the database to become as complete a source of tRNA knowledge as possible, it requires regular updates. The architecture of T-psi-C allows for easily adding new information.  

The T-psi-C database, in contrary to tRNAdb and GtRNAdb, contains only sequences obtained from RNA sequencing, which is a way to confirm expression of particular tRNA molecule present in the database in particular tissue or organism. tRNA sequences obtained from in silico prediction of sequenced genomes were omitted. T-psiC contains a higher number of tRNA sequences than tRNAdb ‘tRNA sequences’ section (1030 versus 623, for details see Table 1), including most recently published ones. Some of these new sequences were generated using highthroughput transcriptomic methods. We expect that the number of sequences in the T-psi-C database provided by high-throughput techniques will increase rapidly. We also believe that fast and efficient sequencing methods of tRNA molecules together with modified nucleoside identification will be possible in the near future, e.g. by using nanopore sequencing technology, which has been successfully used to identify some modified nucleosides in Escherichia coli 16S rRNA (28).

Figure 1. Representative record of the T-psi-C database showing model molecule – phenylalanine tRNA GmAA from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Molecule in cloverleaf presentation and 3D crystal structure are visible in the bottom part of the picture.  

In the T-psi-C database, tRNA sequence is linked with 3D structure obtained from PDB or generated by homology modeling. Such data were absent in previous tRNA databases. At the present time, 3D structures or models are available for 899 sequences. The remaining part represents tRNAs with non-canonical 3D structures (usually mitochondrial), which are difficult to modeling. We are currently working on programming solutions to overcome this problem and generate the missing models as well as improve some of existing ones.  

A unique feature of the T-psi-C database in comparison to previous tRNA databases, is the possibility of continuous update by any member of scientific community. It will help to keep the database up-to-date, especially in the ‘omics’ technologies era, when large amount of data are generated in a very short time.  

The T-psi-C database can be further developed by adding information about the level of tRNA expression in different tissues, of eukaryotic organisms, pathological tRNA mutations, sites of interactions with proteins, sequences of tRNA precursors, rendering it even more useful for the scientific community. Therefore we would appreciate it if users add such annotations in their contributed database records.

# ABSTRACT  

Housekeeping (HK) genes are constitutively expressed genes that are required for the maintenance of basic cellular functions. Despite their importance in the calibration of gene expression, as well as the understanding of many genomic and evolutionary features, important discrepancies have been observed in studies that previously identified these genes. Here, we present Housekeeping and Reference Transcript Atlas (HRT Atlas v1.0, www. housekeeping.unicamp.br) a web-based database which addresses some of the previously observed limitations in the identification of these genes, and offers a more accurate database of human and mouse HK genes and transcripts. The database was generated by mining massive human and mouse RNA-seq data sets, including 11 281 and 507 highquality RNA-seq samples from 52 human nondisease tissues/cells and 14 healthy tissues/cells of C57BL/6 wild type mouse, respectively. User can visualize the expression and download lists of 2158 human HK transcripts from 2176 HK genes and 3024 mouse HK transcripts from 3277 mouse HK genes. HRT Atlas also offers the most stable and suitable tissue selective candidate reference transcripts for normalization of qPCR experiments. Specific primers and predicted modifiers of gene expression for some of these HK transcripts are also proposed. HRT Atlas has also been integrated with a regulatory elements resource from Epiregio server.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Housekeeping (HK) genes have been classically defined as genes that are required for the maintenance of basic cellular functions, important for the existence of any cell type. Hence, they are expected to be constitutively expressed in all cell types of the organism in normal physiological condition regardless of specific cell function, cell cycle step or developmental stage (1,2). Due to these characteristics, HK genes are useful as references of gene expression in molecular biology and computational experiments (3–9), as well as in our understanding of various structural and functional genomics and evolutionary features (10–13). In biomedical research, the importance of the precise identification of HK genes stems from the fact that these genes are used as internal controls for the calibration of quantitative PCR (qPCR), a workhorse technique in molecular biology and biotechnology laboratories used to quantitatively estimate the expression of any gene of interest under different experimental conditions (9,14). However, the fact that HK genes are used as calibrators for these analyses implicates that the accuracy of qPCR results can be severely jeopardized if an inadequate HK gene is used. Accordingly, the selection of HK genes can well be considered one of the factors associated with the reproducibility crisis that affect biomedical science.  

In the early days of qPCR, only a limited number of genes such as GAPDH, B2M, HPRT, actins, tubulins or rRNA genes were considered HK genes, based on their functions associated with cell maintenance, and on the observation that they tended to be constitutively expressed (15–17). Since then, these genes have been extensively used as reference genes for qPCR normalization (18–20). However, more recently, the expression of some of these genes have been shown to vary considerably across cell types and conditions, suggesting that their widespread use might not be the most accurate strategy to calibrate qPCR results (21–23). The advent of high-throughput transcriptomic technologies allowed the identification of larger lists, encompassing hundreds to thousands of putative HK genes (1,15,24– 27). However, despite representing an improvement in the identification of HK genes, the concordance between these studies is still low (1,15,24–26), and false positives remain a problem (2).  

Problems with these currently available HK gene lists (1,24-26,15) could be associated with limitations in studies that generated them, with the first being the very definition of what a HK gene is. HK genes are normally defined according to two definitions. The first one assumes that HK genes are constitutively expressed in every tissue, with a level above an arbitrary cutoff level, used to distinguish candidate HK genes from noise and/or from weakly expressed parts of the genome (2,15,25). The second definition emphasizes that a HK gene should present a constant and stable expression across all tissue, instead of using a universal cutoff of expression level (1,2). However, as genes can be expressed at different level in different tissues, the former definition excludes genes that are stably expressed at different levels in different tissues. Even though the second definition extends the first one, both failed to consider alternative splicing, a fundamental aspect of transcriptome complexity. As genes may have one or more isoforms variably expressed across tissues, instead of the ‘one gene, one polypeptide’ concept, it is possible that one gene stably expresses one transcript in a set of tissues or cells, and another transcript in other sets of tissues (1,28,29). Therefore, we propose that a refined definition of HK genes should be formulated as: a single constitutive gene that expresses at least one of its protein-coding transcripts at a non-zero expression level, with low variability, which may either, be constitutively expressed in all or in a subset of tissues. In the case that any of these transcripts are constitutively expressed across all tissues, they can be referred to as a HK transcript. Following the standardization of qPCR terminology provided by the minimum information for publication of quantitative realtime PCR experiments (MIQE) guidelines (14), genes used for normalization should be referred to as reference genes, not as HK genes. Accordingly, we use the term ‘reference transcript’ to define transcripts that are suitable for qPCR normalization (i.e. fulfill the criteria of HK transcript and are stably expressed in the specific experimental condition or tissue of interest). As such, we described in this study both HK transcripts/genes for general purpose and reference transcripts only for qPCR expression normalization in a tissue-selective context. We excluded non-coding RNAs as evidences showed that they can display higher natural sample-to-sample expression variation than protein-coding genes (30), which seems to be multi-factorial. As such, it will be difficult to make prediction using these non-coding transcripts.  

A second limitation of current HK gene lists refers to the fact that they were identified in studies involving a relatively low diversity of tissues and cell types, as well as low sampling, which can introduce false positives (1,15,24–26). And finally, technical biases from first generation microarray and Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) sequencing data could have also affected the accuracy of HK gene identification in previous studies. Briefly, besides the problem of hybridization and cross-hybridization artifacts, microarrays are also affected by dye-based detection issues and the capability to detect low abundant genes that can be physiologically relevant. Furthermore, the coverage of all possible genes by first-generation platforms is also very limited (15,27). EST sequencing data are mainly affected by biases of cDNA libraries cloning processes which determine what transcript sequences are represented (31). In contrast to these technologies, RNA-seq technology overcomes microarray and EST limitation and provides a more comprehensive way to measure transcriptome by ultra-high-throughput sequencing (32). Together these limitations may explain the large discrepancy of currently available HK gene lists, and justify efforts to refine their definition and identification.  

To fill this gap we present HRT Atlas v1.0, a web-based tool that provides access to a reliable database of human and mouse HK genes and transcripts. By combining highquality gene expression data generated with RNA-seq from a large diversity of tissues deposited at two large public databases (GTEx and ARCHS4) (33), with a stringent detection strategy based on a refined and strict definition of what a HK gene is, HRT Atlas v1.0 offers to the research community a valuable and accurate tool to the identification of these genes and transcripts for use as calibrators of qPCR experiments, as well as for other research questions.  

# DATA COLLECTION  

The workflow for the generation of our database (Figure 1) was based on data generated in the GTEx project (version 7) and ARCHS4 (33). These projects provide expression data from RNA-seq in a useful processed format that enables the reuse of their datasets. For the identification of human HK genes, non-normalized transcript level read counts and meta-data from 11 281 samples, including 52 non-disease sites tissues were downloaded from GTEx portal. These data were also used to identify the most reliable candidate reference genes for each cell and tissue. In addition, other 2111 samples from 50 human tissues and cell types were obtained from ARCHS4 to increase the candidate reference genes database following a rigorous filtering strategy: (i) sequencing depth equal or higher than 20 000 000 reads; (ii) alignment rate provided by ARCHS4 higher than $70\%$ ; (iii) library generated from mRNA enrichment protocol; (iv) and construction of paired end read library. These strategies were designed to enable an accurate detection of transcript isoforms. In fact, relevant studies library have already pointed to the importance of RNA-seq depth and paired-end read construction in the estimation of alternative spliced isoforms expression level (34–36). For the identification of mouse HK genes, 507 high-quality RNAseq data sets from 14 tissues and cells types from wild type healthy C57BL/6 control mice were manually curated from ARCHS4 following the same criteria described above.  

# DATA PROCESSING  

# Identification of HK genes  

After downloading of the datasets, read counts were librarysize normalized for each cell and tissue type (using TMM (Trimmed Mean of $M\cdot$ -values) normalization factor), and the TMM normalized RPKM (reads per kilobase million) were calculated using edgeR package (37) in R environment (R Core Team (2019) R: the R Project for Statistical Computing). The identification of HK genes was based on the previously mentioned definition of a HK gene: specifically, to be considered a HK gene, a single gene must have fulfilled the following criteria: (i) the gene must be expressed at non-zero level in all tissue and cell types included in the analysis (that is, at least one of its protein-coding transcripts must have an expression level higher than 1 RPKM); (ii) the variability of transcript expression should be low within all tissues and cell types, as evidence by a standard deviation of the $\log_{2}$ $\mathbf{RPKM}<1$ ; (iii) the maximum fold change (MFC), represented by the ratio between maximum and average $\log_{2}$ RPKM of the transcript ((maximum $\log_{2}$ RPKM)/(average $\log_{2}$ RPKM)), must be lower than 2. Only transcripts with well-supported transcript models were included in the database (transcripts with Refseq and/or the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) project annotation). Finally, transcripts belonging to these HK genes were considered HK transcripts if they were, in addition, constitutively expressed in all of the analyzed tissues and cells types that were analyzed.

Figure 1. Housekeeping and Reference Transcript Atlas v1.0 workflow. The workflow of database generation and web-tool implementation are shown. After downloading and identification of HK genes and transcripts using a specific algorithm, transcripts of genes with unknown pseudogenes were used to select suitable candidate reference transcripts. Some candidate reference transcript-specific primers were designed. The web-based tool was developed using Shiny package and encapsulated into docker image for deployment.  

# Identification of candidate reference transcripts  

The conventional strategy of qPCR normalization used the expression of reference genes to calibrate the expression levels of genes of interest. Here, we observed that only a few transcripts per HK gene fulfilled our criteria and were defined as HK transcripts. Thus, a more accurate strategy would be the normalization of qPCR experiments using reference transcripts instead of the currently used ‘gene model’. In order to test this hypothesis, we summarized the transcript RPKM into gene model as previously described (38). Then, genes RPKM were further submitted to our HK genes identification criteria. Overall, 1003 genes passed our criteria, of which only 823 were common with HRT Atlas $\mathrm{v}1.0~\mathrm{HK}$ genes list (Supplementary Table S1). This reinforces the adequacy of our suggested normalization strategy. Further qPCR experiments are being performed to demonstrate the reliability of the transcript-based method for determining candidate reference genes.  

So, to refine the list of transcripts that can be further validated as reference transcripts in qPCR experiments, reliable transcripts were selected for each tissue. Briefly, the list of identified HK transcripts was used to provide suitable reference transcripts for selected cells and tissues, for qPCR experiment normalization. Candidate reference transcripts had presented a standard deviation of the $\log_{2}{\mathrm{RPKM}}<\bar{0}.5$ and mean of RPKM greater or equal to 30. This threshold has been arbitrarily fixed to minimize the selection of transcripts which could exhibit very high or undetected Ct in a particular qPCR experimental condition. This threshold have been set as default but alternatively, user can disable the filtering option to display the full list of candidate reference transcripts, including those with mean RPKM ${<}30$ . Finally, to ensure reliability of qPCR experiments, isoforms of genes with known pseudogenes were also excluded from the reference transcripts lists (39,40).  

# CANDIDATE REFERENCE TRANSCRIPT RANKING SYSTEM: SCORE PRODUCT  

Following candidate reference transcript identification, an algorithm based on the determination of a ‘Score product’ was developed to rank these transcripts in each tissue or cell type. The algorithm was built to prioritize the most reliable transcripts for $\mathrm{\qPCR}$ normalization. Candidate reference transcript stability was ranked based on mean RPKM, standard deviation of $\log_{2}$ RPKM and MFC value. Giving $n$ transcripts, three intermediate scores $(k=3)$ ) with equal weight were generated (score-1, score-2, and score-3 for RKPM, standard deviation and MFC, respectively for each transcript). Score-1 assigns $n$ to the highest expressed transcript, estimated by mean RPKM, and 1 to the lowest expressed. Similarly, for score-2 and score-3 the highest scoring transcripts are the ones that have the lowest standard deviation or the lowest MFC. Given $s c_{t,i}$ the score of the transcript $t$ for the ith rank, we express the Score Product (SP) via the geometric mean:  

$$
\mathrm{SP}\left(t\right)=\left(\prod_{i=1}^{k}{s c_{t,i}}\right)^{\frac{1}{k}}
$$  

The highest scoring transcript is one that has the highest SP and is assigned to the first position $\left(\mathrm{rank}=1\right.$ ). That way, the nth transcript is the one that has the lowest SP. The SP is proportional to the variability.  

# PRIMER DESIGN  

In addition to the identification and ranking of candidate reference transcripts, we also manually designed specific primer pairs that can be used for qPCR normalization. These candidate reference transcript-specific primer pairs were designed to facilitate the reference transcript-based normalization strategy that we are suggesting. Primer-pairs were designed to target amplicons with length spanning between 75 and 200 bp, and templates with long repeats of single bases $(>4)$ were avoided. Each primer of a primer pair was quality checked with the following criteria: (i) GC content must be between 50 and $60\%$ ; (ii) the melting temperature $(T_{\mathrm{m}})$ of all primer pairs must be between $50^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and $\mathrm{\bar{65^{\circ}C}}$ with a Tm difference between primer pairs ideally lower than $3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and (iii) secondary structure and primer-dimer formation were avoided. At least one of the primer-pairs was designed to span two exon junctions to minimize genomic DNA contamination, and their transcript level specificity was checked using In-Silico PCR web tool (41). Furthermore, salt concentration of $50\ \mathrm{mM\(Na^{+})}$ and divalent ion concentration of $1.5\mathrm{\mM\(Mg^{2+})}$ have been used. Two annealing oligo concentrations (200 and $300{\mathrm{nM}}_{.}$ ) have been tested and $200~\mathrm{{nM}}$ was chosen for having greater or equal performance during validation. Finally, we excluded all genes with known pseudogene from the candidate reference transcripts detection pipeline. These settings didn’t be considered to completely avoid genomic DNA amplification; as such they cannot replace a rigorous pre-processing such as the use of DNase.  

# INTEGRATION OF HRT ATLAS WITH PREDICTED GENE EXPRESSION MODIFIERS  

In order to further guide the choice of suitable candidate reference genes for qPCR normalization, our list of human HK genes was integrated with the following resources extracted from the Harmonizome platform (42), which were downloaded and manually curated: GEO Signatures of Differentially Expressed Genes for Diseases, GEO Signatures of Differentially Expressed Genes for Small Molecules and Connectivity Map Signatures of Differentially Expressed Genes for Small Molecules. These datasets were used to provide users with a list of small molecules and diseases which have been previously shown to modify the expression of each HK gene, when available.  

# IMPLEMENTATION AND DATA ACCESS  

All of the generated data were loaded into SQLite database. HRT Atlas v1.0 web tool was developed using Shiny package. The application front-end was implemented using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 4. All of the components and a Shiny Server were encapsulated in a deployable Docker container running on a Unix-based operating system with Apache HTTP server. User instructions communicated to the server were processed by R and the requests are sent to the SQLite database mounted as the container volume. Figure 1 schematically represents the general workflow of the resource (Figure 1A). HRT Atlas v1.0 offers a user friendly and reactive interface designed to provide a nice using experience. The web tool was tested in Firefox, Chrome, Explorer, Safari as well as android and iOS small devices.  

# DATABASE CONTENTS AND FEATURES  

# HRT Atlas v1.0 statistics  

HRT Atlas analyzed 11 281 and 507 human and mouse samples respectively, involving 52 human cell and tissue types and 14 mouse cell and tissue types. After processing, 2176 unique genes fulfilled our criteria and were defined as HK genes, of which $2158~\mathrm{HK}$ transcripts were constitutively expressed. In the mouse database, $3277\ \mathrm{HK}$ transcripts and $3024~\mathrm{HK}$ genes fulfilled our criteria. At least two HK transcript-specific primers were designed per tissue to facilitate using of more than one candidate reference for normalization purpose. Overall, 31 and 17 primer-pairs were designed for human and mouse candidate reference transcripts, respectively.  

Furthermore, $52\%$ of the human HK genes present their orthologs in the mouse HK list (the full lists can be downloaded from Download page). We compared our list of HK genes with previously published lists which were also based on RNA-seq data sets (1,25,26). As shown in Figure 2A, only 91 human HK genes were exclusively identified in the present study (Figure 2A). Similarly, a high overlap was also observed between previous mouse HK genes lists (43,44) and our HRT Atlas database (Figure 2B). Importantly, thousands of genes identified in these previous studies did not fulfill our stringent criteria. These results support our hypothesis that these previous lists of HK genes, generated with low sample size and heterogeneous definitions of HK genes, might suffer from low specificity. We performed two simulations to investigate whether samples size and tissue type diversity can affect the prediction of HK genes/transcripts using GTEx dataset. Applying our HK transcripts detection criteria to 6 groups of random sampled tissues (5, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 50 tissue types respectively) we observed that the number of transcripts that fulfilled our HK transcripts criteria decreases as the number of tissue types increases (Supplementary Figure S1A). With the second simulation, by using all of the tissues included in our analysis, we clearly observed that the accuracy of detection is also associated with the sample size (Supplementary Figure S1B) as the stably expressed transcript’s number decreases with increasing sample size. For each of these simulations, random sample was obtained and 100 permutations were performed to detect the median number of stably expressed transcripts. Finally, we observed in Figure 2A, a large set of genes (1801 genes) that were detected by previous methods but not in HRT Atlas. This large genes set has been analyzed and we observed that about $98\%$ did not fulfill the non-zero expression criterion. The remaining $2\%$ have high variability that is a high standard deviation and/or MCF. The description of these genes in previous studies as housekeeping genes can result from the relatively small sample size of these studies, which as shown in the simulations, reduce the accuracy of the predictions. Together, these results and observation showed that both sample size and tissue/cell diversity can improve the accuracy of HK genes detection and explained at least partially the large discrepancy observed between previous studies and our database.

Figure 2. Overlap of HRT Atlas with other HK genes lists. (A) The diagram demonstrates that only 91 human genes were exclusively detected in the present study. In contrast, thousands of putative HK genes that have been previously listed by other authors (listed in the diagrams) were not identified by our criteria and are not listed in our HRT Atlas. (B) Similarly, when comparing HRT Atlas with previous mouse HK genes studies, 141 genes were exclusively detected in the present study, while several others which were listed in previous studies did not reach the criteria established in HRT Atlas.  

# Web interface  

From the home interface users can access human and mouse candidate reference transcripts databases by clicking on the human or mouse icons. The search interface allows searching for reliable candidate reference transcripts for qPCR normalization by selecting one of the 102 tissues or cell types included in our human database and 22 tissues in the mouse database. By clicking on the search box, the full list of cells and tissues is automatically displayed on the screen and user can select one option to interrogate the SQLite database. From the same interface users can also access link to visualize expression of HK transcripts across cells/tissues, or to download the complete list. A similar interface is provided for mouse database.  

In each of these interfaces, after searching for a specific cell or tissue type, the results page shows the list of candidate reference transcripts. Each transcript is identified by its Ensembl ID, followed by the gene symbol. By default, results are ranked by the SP criteria described above. Alternatively, transcripts can be ranked at the convenience of the user by clicking in the arrow next to any of these parameters (Figure 3A). Users can select the number of candidate reference transcripts to be shown per page, and then download the full list displayed on the screen in their preferred format (csv, or pdf). Specific primer pair lists can also be downloaded. All the primer pairs were validated according to MIQE guidelines. User can access the quality parameters of each primer pair and download its standard curve and the melting curve.  

As diseases and small molecules are known to affect the stability of housekeeping genes, HRT Atlas is integrated with three manually curated functional association data sets from Harmonizome database that predict expression stability modifiers based on differential expression, and are intended to guide users in the choice of the best candidate

reference transcripts for qPCR normalization. A transcript must be avoided for normalization of qPCR if the disease or the molecule of interest appears in its gene modifiers list (Figure 3B). These datasets can be accessed from the results page. Alternatively, when clicking on ‘Expression Modifiers’ in the navigation bar, users can access the same information for any single gene. In addition, HRT Atlas has been integrated with EpiRegio REST API (45) to retrieve information about regulatory elements (REMs) that are able to regulate gene expression. This resource can also be accessed from results page (Regulatory Element). EpiRegio is a web server which allows the analysis of genes and their associated REMs estimated in cell type-specific context.  

Users can access the ‘Gene expression’ menu from the navigation bar to visualize gene expression across tissue and cell types. This interface also provides the description of a selected HK gene, its official name and its synonyms retrieved from the NCBI’s portal and based on Ref

The performance of newly described candidate reference transcripts and proposed for PBMCs (the transcripts ENST00000253039 and ENST00000335508 for EIF2S3 and SF3B1) were compared with some commonly used genes (ACTB, B2M, GAPDH and PPIA1). The combination of transcripts ENST00000253039 and ENST00000335508 is the most suitable with the lowest geNorm M stability metric.

Finally, by clicking on the ‘Download’ menu from the navigation bar, users can download the complete list of human and mouse HK genes and HK transcripts. From the same page users can download a list of the most stable genes across all non-disease analyzed tissues. These genes can be validated in cell types not included in our database for further normalization purposes.  

# Case study of the use of the database  

The main application of the database is qPCR gene expression normalization. As a proof of concept of the reliability of the newly proposed candidate reference transcripts, two candidate reference transcripts described in PBMCs (the transcripts ENST00000253039 and ENST00000335508 for EIF2S3 and SF3B1) were tested by comparing their stability metrics (geNorm M metric) with some commonly used genes (ACTB, B2M, GAPDH and PPIA1). Our results (geNorm ranking) showed that the newly described transcripts in PBMCs were the most suitable for normalization in this testing context (Figure 5). Interestingly GAPDH, in 3th position, has been described as HK transcript in the database but not as a suitable candidate reference gene in PBMC (Figure 5). This observation reinforces the necessity of tissue-selective section. Alternatively, we also used RNAseq datasets to calculate the same stability metrics across 12 different tissues random sampled that were included in our database (Supplementary Table S2). This analysis compared the best ranked candidate reference transcripts in each tissue with: (i) their respective genes (included all of their coding and non-protein coding transcripts) and (ii) 12 other commonly used reference genes. As shown in the Supplementary Table S2, the newly described candidate reference transcripts were more suitable for normalization than genes commonly used. Interestingly, the candidate reference transcripts also exhibited greatest stability in comparison with their respective genes expression. These results also suggested that the reference transcriptbased normalization strategy instead of the commonly used gene-based method and the newly proposed candidate references transcript may be considered as suitable method of gene expression normalization.  

HRT Atlas database has a limitation that need to be acknowledged. The relative small sample size of mouse datasets can reduce the accuracy of the prediction of mouse housekeeping or reference transcripts. Unfortunately, there are no large datasets with homogeneously pre-processing for mouse as the GTEx datasets for humans so that RNAseq data have been manual curated. As we analyzed expression at transcript level, we opted to include only datasets that fulfilled some criteria known to contribute to a more robust transcript’s expression estimate such as: (i) the inclusion of libraries only constructed with paired-end read to improve estimation accuracy over single-end reads (46,47); (ii) high sequencing depth with at least twenty millions of reads to improve the estimation of low abundant genes and exons and splice junctions (34). Furthermore, only wild type mice were included. So, by prioritizing these quality criteria over a large but heterogeneous dataset, we aimed to minimize unwanted experimental confounder in our predictions. In our knowledge, this is the largest mouse dataset analyzed in a workflow of mouse HK genes detection. Despite this small data size, human and mouse databases have $52\%$ of detected orthologous genes. Furthermore, the HK genes described in human as well as in mouse were shown to be involved mainly in basal metabolism pathways (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4) such that one can predict that they are enriched in HK genes. Finally, the prediction of gene modifiers will be improved in future versions. Because there is no way to know whether gene expression will change under all experimental and disease conditions, we recommend empirical validation of the proposed candidate reference transcripts before using in qPCR experiments. Furthermore, we highly recommended users to consider using of at least two candidate reference transcripts for qPCR normalization as recommended by MIQE guidelines.  

In conclusion, HRT Atlas v1.0 represents a valuable tool for researchers from a wide range of fields in biomedical research, due to its capability to refine the identification of a critical parameter (i.e. the gene used to calibrate expression level reads) in one of the most commonly used techniques of molecular biology studies. The database can also be used to assist in research questions about structural and functional genomics that require a more precise identification of human and mouse HK genes and transcripts. Our strategy for the future will focus in including more cells and tissues into the database. We are also planning to analyze, using the same workflow, samples from other model organisms.

# ABSTRACT  

By identifying genomic sequence regions conserved among several species, comparative genomics offers opportunities to discover putatively functional elements without any prior knowledge of what these functions might be. Comparative analyses across mammals estimated $4\text{\textperthousand}$ of the human genome to be functionally constrained, a much larger fraction than the $1-2\%$ occupied by annotated proteincoding or RNA genes. Such functionally constrained yet unannotated regions have been referred to as conserved non-coding sequences (CNCs) or ultraconserved elements (UCEs), which remain largely uncharacterized but probably form a highly heterogeneous group of elements including enhancers, promoters, motifs, and others. To facilitate the study of such CNCs/UCEs, we present our resource of Conserved Elements from Genomic Alignments (CEGA), accessible from http://cega.ezlab.org. Harnessing the power of multiple species comparisons to detect genomic elements under purifying selection, CEGA provides a comprehensive set of CNCs identified at different radiations along the vertebrate lineage. Evolutionary constraint is identified using threshold-free phylogenetic modeling of unbiased and sensitive global alignments of genomic synteny blocks identified using protein orthology. We identified CNCs independently for five vertebrate clades, each referring to a different last common ancestor and therefore to an overlapping but varying set of CNCs with 24 488 in vertebrates, 241 575 in amniotes, 709 743 in Eutheria, 642 701 in Boreoeutheria and 612 364 in Euarchontoglires, spanning from 6 Mbp in vertebrates to 119 Mbp in Euarchontoglires. The dynamic CEGA web interface displays alignments, genomic locations, as well as biologically relevant data to help prioritize and select CNCs of interest for further functional investigations.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Genome sequencing provides access to the complete repertoire of inherited functional elements, from encoded genes to regulatory sequences, but recognizing these elements and understanding their biological activities remains challenging. Comparative genomics offers an approach to help recognize such elements, by identifying sequences that remain conserved across multiple species over millions of years of evolution (1). Their intolerance to mutations, making them appear as conserved, implies functional constraints on such sequences, regardless of our knowledge of their functions. Applying such methods to the increasing number of sequenced genomes has helped to identify core genes conserved across many species and has additionally revealed a repertoire of genomic elements at least as large as that of protein-coding genes that does not encode proteins or RNA genes (2–5). These elements were termed Conserved Non-Coding sequences (CNCs) (6,7), and the investigation of their functional roles is still ongoing. Some of the most highly-conserved elements in vertebrates, termed Ultra-Conserved Elements (UCEs) have been tested in vivo, but only about half of these showed any capacity for specific cis-regulatory activities (8).  

Beyond the lack of systematic experimental investigations of such CNCs or UCEs, the variable technical definitions used to classify such elements have hampered progress in this field of research. For example, the working definition of CNCs from pioneering studies (9) selected an arbitrary threshold of a minimum sequence identity over a minimum alignment length in pairwise sequence comparisons, which is still a frequently used definition. However, with no systematic approach to select threshold parameters, the results from employing such a definition are clearly impacted by the evolutionary distance between the pair of species being compared. Various strategies have been developed to fine-tune these definitions in order to generate genomescale resources of computationally-identified CNCs and to help prioritize candidates in turn satisfying the growing interest in developing functional screens of these elements. Most of the existing resources employ pairwise DNA alignments as a starting point to define CNCs, e.g. human and mouse (VISTA enhancer browser (8)), human and chicken (UCNEbase (10)), human and zebrafish (cneViewer, (11)), or human and fugu (CONDOR (12)). However, pairwise alignments lack comparative power, and ignore the additional evolutionary information to be gleaned from including any of the dozens of vertebrate genomes already sequenced. Extending such approaches by searching ‘seed’ CNCs identified from pairwise comparisons to other species does not completely resolve this issue. If a conserved element is not present (or sequenced) in the species chosen for the initial pairwise comparison, it will not be part of the final set of CNCs. Thus, pairwise approaches are inherently biased and not comprehensive. Similarly, the extension of the pairwise approach to several species, by the choice of a reference organism and subsequent alignments to it, is also biased and not very sensitive to distantly-related species. In addition, definitions of conservation vary considerably, e.g. $100\%$ identity over ${\geq}200$ bp for the VISTA enhancer browser, $295\%$ identity over $\geq200$ bp for UCNEbase, user-defined conservation, length, or distance cutoffs for cneViewer, $70–100\%$ identity over $\geq30$ bp or $\geq50$ bp for ANCORA (13) (depending on the species pair being considered), $270\%$ identity over $\geq100$ bp (human–mouse) and $265\%$ identity over $\geq50$ bp (mammal–fugu) for TFCONES, $265\%$ identity over $\geq40$ bp for CONDOR and $100\%$ identity over ${\geq}200$ bp in human, mouse and rat for UCbase2.0 (14). Some of these resources additionally provide access to the results of regulatory screening of CNCs. Notably, the Vista enhancer browser indexes the results of gene enhancer activity in transgenic mice for 2192 elements, and around a hundred of the 7000 CNCs in CONDOR were tested in-vivo for enhancer activity in zebrafish embryos.  

To advance the field of research on the identification and characterization of CNCs, we devised a computational pipeline to yield a comprehensive and unbiased set of conserved elements at different radiations along the vertebrate lineage. We overcome the limitations of pairwise approaches by harnessing the power of multiple species comparisons to detect genomic elements under purifying selection using at least five species (15). We gain sensitivity for identifying CNCs by employing global sequence alignments without a reference organism (16) for each of the collinear genomic blocks defined by protein orthology. We rely on phastCons (17) phylogenetic modeling to objectively define conserved elements. The resulting catalog of Conserved Elements from Genomic Alignments (CEGA) provides access to these sets of conserved elements from http://cega.ezlab.org, 24 488 CNCs in the vertebrate clade to 612 364 CNCs in the euarchontoglires (Supraprimates). The CEGA web interface allows browsing of all conserved elements annotated as coding, intergenic or intronic with complementary features selected from the The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) data (18) such as chromatin state annotations (19) which provide clues to their possible biological functions.  

# IDENTIFICATION OF CONSERVED GENOMIC ELEMENTS  

The CEGA resource presents sets of conserved genomic elements computed independently from a total of 55 vertebrate species. Conservation of a genomic element in a set of species implicitly refers to its presence in the last common ancestor (LCA) of these species. We therefore independently considered five different vertebrate clades: vertebrates, amniotes, Eutheria, Boreoeutheria and Euarchontoglires, each referring to a different LCA and thus to an overlapping but varying set of CNCs. With a total of 1 398 498 CNCs, CEGA offers a comprehensive catalog of conserved elements at each level of the vertebrate phylogeny (Table 1), a third of which are intergenic and the remaining two thirds are intronic. The steps that comprise CEGAs computational pipeline to identify CNCs are explained below and in further details in the Supplementary Material as well as schematically outlined in Figure 1.

# Synteny block delineation  

The CEGA pipeline starts with the identification of collinear genomic blocks, also termed synteny blocks, to then be able to perform reliable alignments of the sequences from each block. Delineation of these blocks is based on single-copy orthologous protein markers from OrthoDB (release7) (20). Protein-based markers provide the advantages of having a slower rate of sequence evolution, additional informational content at the amino acid level, and longer sequences than DNA markers used by other approaches to identify orthologous relations and synteny blocks, e.g. in Enredo (21). After looking for synteny blocks between pairs of species, CEGA defines blocks with sets of five species, sufficient to harness the comparative power (15). To maximize the coverage of synteny blocks across the human genome and to take advantage of the growing number of available vertebrate genomes, each block may be defined by different sets of species. In practice, we developed a scoring system based on the phylogenetic distance between each pair of species, the length of the block in terms of number of orthologous protein markers, and the genome sequence quality in terms of gaps in the assemblies to automatically select the best combination of species. Species selection is constrained to contain human and at least one organism from the root level (i.e. most distant from human) of the investigated clade in order to fully span the phylogeny. The common markers identified in all five pairwise blocks across are extracted and the corresponding genomic sequence is further extended by $15\mathrm{Kb}$ flanks in each genome to include additional intergenic sequences. Employing this strategy resulted in large fractions (from $608{\bar{\mathrm{~Mb~}}}$ to 1’830 Mb) of the human genome being delineated in to synteny blocks (Table 1).

# Multiple sequence alignments  

Although we focused on human, requiring all synteny blocks to contain human genomic sequence, CEGA aims to provide unbiased alignments, without using a reference organism. We also target conservation across large evolutionary distances (human – fish) requiring sensitive alignments. Since the protein-orthology-based identification of synteny blocks implies the orthology of the corresponding genomic regions, we opted to use global alignment approaches that attempt to align sequences along the whole lengths of the genomic sequences. After extensive benchmarking of many available alignment methods, we selected MLAGAN (16) that provides global alignments with a local anchoring strategy without requiring the selection of a reference species. To overcome the ‘Heads or Tails’ bias problem (22), i.e. obtaining different results when aligning the exact same sequences in the forward and reverse orientations, we aligned each of the five sequences of the synteny blocks both on the forward and the reverse strands and reconciled the alignments by merging them with MergeAlign (23).  

served model (parameters and models are described in detail in the supplementary material). Finally, elements with ‘N’ sequence stretches or having less than 20 nucleotides aligned were filtered out of the conserved set.  

# Identification of conservation  

# Expanding to other species  

Since conserved elements are initially identified from a subset of only five species, we used a hidden Markov model (HMM) profile built with nhmmer from HMMER 3.1 (24) using each individual element to search whole genome assemblies of all other species. These searches were carried out using the set of vertebrate elements to search all vertebrate genomes. A similar strategy was used for the amniote clade, but limiting the searches to those synteny blocks with previously identified orthologous regions in other species. The highest scoring significant match ( $\scriptstyle{\mathcal{e}}$ -value ${<}0.05$ ) was selected and the alignment of the element recomputed using muscle (25). Currently, CEGA only presents HMMexpanded elements for Vertebrate and Amniotes. In further development the same procedure can be applied to the other clades.  

# Functional annotation  

Based on Ensembl gene annotations (26) for all species, elements were annotated as either protein-coding, RNAcoding (micro-RNA and long non-coding RNA), intronic or intergenic. These classifications are complemented with selected annotation from the ENCODE project (18) were incorporated such as the chromatin state (19), the number of transcription factors that bind to the genomic region (27), and DNase accessibility values (28). These represent informative annotations that offer additional evidence to help select elements for future investigations of their biological function investigations, e.g. cis-regulatory activities. In addition, overlapping ultra-conserved elements defined by alternative approaches available from other databases are listed for easy cross-referencing.  

To avoid selecting arbitrary identity and lengths thresholds, the classification of CEGA sets of conserved element employs phylogenetic modeling with phastCons (17) to define evolutionarily constrained elements. The conservation metrics reported are log-odds scores of the probability of the element following a conserved model rather than an uncon  

# CEGA DATABASE CONTENT  

CEGA database is structured into five main data tables, for each of the investigated vertebrate clade: Vertebrates, Amniotes, Eutheria, Boreoeutheria and Euarchontoglires. In each table, conserved elements are organized into synteny blocks, and then per element. Each element has an ID and information about its location in each species, as well as its sequence and the corresponding annotations. The synteny blocks cover from $20\%$ to $63\%$ of the human genome, with CNCs ranging from $1\%$ to $6.5\%$ of these blocks, depending on the level of the vertebrate phylogeny.

Figure 2. CEGA user interface.  

# CEGA web interface  

The database is accessible through a dynamic web interface browsable by selecting a region of interest on a human chromosome view or by submitting a genomic location or a gene of interest. In the latter case, the gene genomic position is retrieved from annotations (26) and further expanded with 1 Mbp flanks. The main CEGA display is a table showing the previously described information about each conserved element overlapping the submitted locus. Each row is expandable by just one click to view the sequence alignment from the element, its details in the other species and a screenshot of the genomic location of the element from the UCSC genome browser (29). Access to UCSC browser displaying CEGA tracks can be made directly from the whole region table or from the element view. This functionality is intended as an entry point for the analysis of further biologically-relevant annotations.  

As shown on the example of CEGA interface on Figure 2, three columns of the table represent selected biological data from ENCODE that can help to make a selection of relevant elements. The DNAse column shows the DNase sensitivity of the locus with a grayscale, from white for no data or 0 scoring to black for the highest score. This score is based on the combination of the DNAse sensitivity in  

125 cell-types (28). Regulatory regions are usually DNase sensitive. The regulatory potential of the element is further detailed by the chromatin state column. Nine circles, one for each of the investigated cell lines, are colored according to the type of activity the integration of chromatin marks data (19) suggests for the genomic region; warm colors represent promoter and enhancer regions whereas cold ones suggest repressed or repetitive region and heterochromatin. The TFBS column simply shows the number of transcription factors with a ChipSeq peak overlapping the conserved element in any of the tested cell lines. This number allows for the selection of highly interacting element over others. A last column is dedicated to the overlap of each CEGA element with ultra-conserved elements identified by other methods. These databases provide other information: gene regulatory blocks and potential gene regulated in UCNE and experimental annotations in CONDOR and Vista enhancer browser.  

A checkbox allows the user to select its elements of interest and get bed or Fasta files for them. Bed files can be used as UCSC tracks, looking for overlaps with specific markers and Fasta is provided to look for similar elements or to explore their evolutionary history. The complete set of CEGA data is also available for bulk download.  

# CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES  

CEGA aims to provide an easy access to unbiased and comprehensive sets of CNCs at distinct levels of the vertebrate lineage. The sets were computed based on a strategy to be as comprehensive and sensitive as possible, while keeping scalability in mind. The strategy of using five species per block can cope with the rapidly increasing number of sequenced genomes while harnessing the comparative power. In the future more species can be included without becoming a computational hurdle. This method has however a drawback of not presenting a constant collection of species, not all conserved elements were computed in all species. CEGA provides a convenient access using dynamic webpages to all elements within a genomic interval or close to a particular gene. Quick visualization of relevant biological data in relation to the conserved elements is also provided and can help prioritize the in-depth investigation of a sub-group of elements. Therefore elements can be selected and downloaded in various formats: as bed-file for visualization and for finding overlaps with other features, as multiple alignments in Fasta format for phylogenetic studies or single sequence Fasta for further studies and comparisons.

# ABSTRACT  

tRNA-derived fragments (tRFs) are a class of emerging post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression likely binding to the transcripts of target genes. However, only a few tRFs targets have been experimentally validated, making it hard to extrapolate the functions or binding mechanisms of tRFs. The paucity of resources supporting the identification of the targets of tRFs creates a bottleneck in the fast-developing field. We have previously analyzed chimeric reads in crosslinked Argonaute1-RNA complexes to help infer the guide-target pairs and binding mechanisms of multiple tRFs based on experimental data in human HEK293 cells. To efficiently disseminate these results to the research community, we designed a web-based database tatDB (targets of tRFs DataBase) populated with close to 250 000 experimentally determined guide-target pairs with ${\sim}23$ 000 tRF isoforms. tatDB has a user-friendly interface with flexible query options/filters allowing one to obtain comprehensive information on given tRFs (or targets). Modes of interactions are supported by secondary structures of potential guide-target hybrids and binding motifs, essential for understanding the targeting mechanisms of tRFs. Further, we illustrate the value of the database on an example of hypothesis-building for a tRFs potentially involved in the lifecycle of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. tatDB is freely accessible at https://grigoriev-lab.camden. rutgers.edu/tatdb.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are best known for their role in translation. There are many databases holding information on tRNAs present in pro- and eukaryotic genomes (1,2), and their identification and curation are not always straightforward (3). In many organisms, the number of tRNA genes is much higher than can be explained by the needs of codon usage (e.g. ${>}500$ in the human genome), with some genes being present in many very similar or even identical copies.  

Functions of some of the copies of such genes have been recently attributed to generation of tRNA fragments (tRFs), an emerging set of small non-coding RNAs with likely regulatory roles akin to microRNA (miRNA). Just as miRNAs, some of tRFs have been found loaded to Argonaute (Ago) proteins, supporting hypotheses of their potential regulation of RNA targets (4–8). tRFs are very diverse, they can be produced from either the precursor or the mature tRNA, and also from different parts of the latter (most frequently, from the $5^{\prime}$ - or $3^{\prime}$ -ends, or also from the middle of tRNA). There is additional (smaller) variation in the exact ends of isoforms of otherwise almost identical tRFs, which resembles the case of isomiRs, whereby multiple slightly different miRNAs can arise from a single gene. The Ago loading levels of tRFs differ between cells and also change with age (9), again resembling miRNAs. While numerous fragments are observed in the cells, actual regulatory functions and targets have been experimentally demonstrated only for a few tRFs (5,10–17), and not all of those followed the mode of action of miRNA. Yet given the parallels between tRFs and miRNAs, some experiments validating tRF targeting have been performed with the miRNA ‘seed’ binding in mind (5). However, a large fraction of tRF targets predicted with miRNA tools has failed in validation experiments (10,14), and we have argued that some of the potential binding motifs of tRFs may deviate from the canonical miRNA concepts (6,18).  

While the tRF field is relatively new, significant progress has been made to elucidate their types and functions, and several recent reviews offer comprehensive summaries of what is currently known about these molecules (19–25). In addition to human, tRFs have been reported in many other organisms, including mouse (26,27), rat (28), fruit fly (9,29), plants (30,31) and prokaryotes (4). In human cells, tRFs have been found to play a role in cancer-related processes, regulating ribosome biogenesis (17) or displacing RNAbinding proteins (32). In other disease contexts, virus infection has been reported to induce some host tRFs (13,16,33) suggesting a potential implication of tRFs in the host-virus interaction.  

An increasing interest in tRFs has led to generating long lists of them, detected in various small RNA sequencing experiments. Several databases hold such lists. However, these databases currently neither offer information on the mechanism of action of these fragments nor on their targets. Experimental evidence of modulating expression of targets and data on a potential binding region exists for only a few tRFs. Most experimental studies focus on one-two tRFs and such results are very hard to generalize (5,10–12,14– 16). In contrast, large numbers of tRFs have been detected in small RNA sequencing datasets and simply listed in the databases. For example, there are ${>}28000$ of human tRFs in MINTbase v2.0 (34), many of which often differ by only one nucleotide. This discrepancy between excessive tRF numbers and the lack of understanding of their function hinders hypothesis generation and prevents efficient systematic functional testing of these novel regulatory molecules. Recently, several databases addressing such issues have appeared (35–38). While attempting to connect tRFs to their targets, these databases contain only relatively small subsets, omitting large numbers of interactions detected (and also, importantly, those validated) experimentally, and we provide more detailed information in Discussion.  

To bridge such gaps, we developed a database of targets of tRFs (tatDB). We aimed to create a transcriptomescale resource and selected for this purpose a dataset, initially produced as a set of chimeric reads combining small RNA guides and mRNA targets, with a focus on miRNAs (39). This dataset/method is called CLASH (40) and our analysis of it is further described in the Methods. Importantly, CLASH contains information about other small RNAs paired with mRNA targets (4). We comprehensively re-analyzed this dataset and observed ${>}8$ million reads supporting the interactions between Ago1-loaded tRFs and various types of target RNAs, which is a significant extension to the other studies. We identified $>1000$ tRFs ${\sim}23$ 000 isoforms), including ones validated by independent experiments (5,10–16). We used these tRF–target CLASH pairs to infer binding regions (motifs) in many tRFs (6), and our results matched the validated binding regions for Agomediated targeting in well-studied tRFs (5,12). Such binding regions in tRFs were also spatially compatible with the Ago-crosslinking sites in tRFs that we identified in PARCLIP datasets (41) and included in tatDB. With comprehensive and stringent analyses, we incorporated many tRFs missing from the existing databases (35–38). Some of these have been experimentally validated, e.g. a tRF derived from the IleTAT $3^{\prime}$ trailer (12). We also detected and included in tatDB novel intron-derived putative tRFs that invite further investigation.  

It is important to note the limitations of the presented data. CLASH is a single dataset, albeit a large one. In our detailed analyses of CLASH (6,18) we have also reported previously unknown biases/features in the reads produced by this technique. While the models we have proposed (6,18) may account for some biases there is no guarantee that no other biases have been missed. The experimental readouts in CLASH (and also PAR-CLIP) may be affected by protein expression artifacts and the results may not reflect tRF loading (and detectable pairing with targets) corresponding to the endogenous levels of Ago1 in vivo. Further, post-lysis loading to Ago of miRNAs (42) (and possibly other small RNAs) may occur and is seldom discussed in the papers on large-scale RNA-protein interactions, although lowered by the cross-linking approaches (43). To summarize, analysis of such data should take into account the numerous sources of potential error.  

We reasoned that tatDB would be a convenient tool for browsing and searching CLASH results (otherwise available as millions of reads requiring complex processing) for potential targets and binding regions as well as for evaluating whether certain hybrid pairs represent biological signal or noise. We hope it would help drive further experiments to establish the actual function and targets of tRFs. With this motivation, we have made it into a publicly available database.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Building tRNA index  

We downloaded tRNA genes from GtRNAdb (1), tRNAdb and mitoRNAdb (2). We firstly ran Bowtie 1.0.1 (-v 0 -a) to align all tRNA genes to human genome (hg38) and excluded sequences that could not be mapped to nuclear or mitochondrial genome. Remaining tRNA genes were collapsed and reindexed for every isodecoder.  

In order to identify tRFs from pre-tRNAs, we extended 40-nt genomic sequences downstream of the tRNA genes. tRNA isoforms that could be mapped to multiple genomic locations may have different flanking sequences on the genome and we considered all possible $3^{\prime}$ trailers.  

tRNAs with introns in the genes were considered in mature (intron was removed from the sequence) or immature (intron was retained the sequence) state for the origins of tRFs. tRFs that cross the exon-exon junctions have ‘X’ in their IDs (see an example in Results section) to indicate the introns were crossed out from the sequences.  

# Analyses of CLASH dataset and PAR-CLIP dataset  

Cross-Ligation and Sequencing of Hybrids (CLASH) method has been developed to identify the chimeric sequences corresponding to RNA-RNA duplexes hybridized in vivo and crosslinked with Ago1 proteins in the human HEK293 cells (39,40). We performed stringent and comprehensive analysis of the CLASH data to establish Ago1-associated tRFs-targets pairs from these chimeric sequences, to identify noise and bias in these datasets, as described previously (6,18), and to extract potential interactions of higher confidence between tRFs and targets.  

The short sequences of tRFs present multiple challenges for sorting out and presenting the CLASH data: e.g. how to handle guides exactly mapped to multiple tRNA genes or how to deal with exon-intron borders? Examples of noise or bias included random sequences matching parts of tRNA and/or target and co-occurring close each other in the genome or a transcript, or polyT tracts matched to certain mRNAs in some chimeras, etc, as described earlier (18).  

Using different targets of the same tRF, we identified common statistically significant motifs, which likely correspond to tRF–target binding regions (at least for several known cases (5,12)) and present a strong argument against their random pairing in CLASH (6). In tatDB, we report various estimates of confidence in interactions, e.g. based on finding the same interaction pairs in divergent and unique chimeras/hybrids. Further, many tRFs were found on both ends of the chimeric reads with target sequences on the other respective end. We call chimeras ‘Forward’ for tRFs on the $5^{\prime}$ end and ‘Reverse’ for tRFs on the $3^{\prime}$ end. Chimeras with such divergent orientations are independent biological constructs and they often support the same tRF–target pairs and common binding motifs in the tRFs (18).  

Given the small size of the mitochondrial genome, we observed a few cases when the target sequence was close to a tRNA gene. For completeness, we kept all such mitochondrial pairs and polyT-containing hybrids. However, some of them (tRFs resulting from the tRNA $5^{\prime}$ end and trailer sequence are found in CLASH pairs with adjacent targets) may represent CLASH artifacts, hence we provided a warning in the Help section of the tatDB.  

Potential Ago-crosslinking sties were revealed by $\mathrm{T}>\mathrm{C}$ conversions in PAR-CLIP datasets of human Ago1–Ago4 (41). PAR-CLIP identified conversions were mapped to tRFs identified by CLASH using our earlier approach (18).  

# Naming convention for tRFs  

We devised a tRF naming scheme that is informative and extensible It has this format:  

# AA AnticodonGeneGenome Isoform Type(X) Start End  

For example,  

# LeuAAG-001-N-3p-68–85  

Every tRNA isoform was assigned with a unique ID using Amino Acid (AA) Anticodon followed by a three-digit index of the corresponding tRNA gene, and $\mathrm{\bfN}$ or M indicating such gene was encoded on nuclear genome or mitochondrial genome. tRFs which could be mapped to tRNAs in both nuclear and mitochondrial genome had -NM- in their IDs.  

We separated tRFs into six types based on their cleaved positions on reference sequences. tRFs which have their $5^{\prime}$ borders cleaved in the first five nucleotides of tRNAs were classified as tRF-5. If the $3^{\prime}$ border of a tRF-5 was in the anticodon loop of a tRNA molecule, it was considered as a $5^{\prime}$ tRNA half and was hence named as tRF-5i in our database. tRF-5 with its $3^{\prime}$ border being cut upstream of the anticodon loop was called tRF-5p. Similarly, tRFs with their $3^{\prime}$ borders cleaved in the last five nucleotides of mature tRNAs (including CCA addition) were classified as tRF-3. tRF-3 were further separated to tRF-3i ( $3^{\prime}$ tRNA half) or tRF-3p. tRF with its $3^{\prime}$ end being cleaved in the $3^{\prime}$ trailer sequence of a pre-tRNA was defined as tRF-3t. The ${5}^{\prime}$ border of a tRF3t could be either within the tRNA gene or in the trailer. tRFs were called tRF-Mi if their $5^{\prime}$ and $3^{\prime}$ ends were in the internal regions (excluding first and last 5 nts) of tRNAs.  

tRNAs isoforms transcribed from the same gene with or without intron retention have the same three-digit index. The coordinates of tRFs on the tRNA isoforms were always calculated based on the sequence of tRNA genes (introns were retained). We added a letter $\mathbf{\epsilon}^{\prime}\mathbf{X}^{\prime}$ after the tRF type (e.g. IleTAT-001-N-iX-36–76) to indicate the tRFs were derived from mature tRNAs where the introns were removed, and to discriminate such tRFs from the tRFs have the same coordinates but the introns were retained in the sequence (e.g. IleTAT-001-N-i-36–76).  

Some tRFs may be aligned to various tRNA isoforms and even different tRNA isoacceptors. Although these tRFs could have different IDs, we provided only one representative ID based on the tRNA isoform which has most copies on the genome unless specifically indicated on the result page.  

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  

We implemented tatDB as MySQL database with a userfriendly interface, allowing for flexible queries using multiple parameters both for tRF and target sequences. The database is publicly available at https://grigoriev-lab. camden.rutgers.edu/tatdb.  

# Search and filters  

The query front end of tatDB is shown in Figure 1A. We provide multiple options to apply different filters to (i) query tRFs to find their targets or (ii) query targets and find tRFs. At the top level, amino acid (3-letter standard abbreviation, AA) and anticodon can specify the tRNA host genes for tRFs. ‘Genome’ indicates whether the tRNA gene is encoded in the nucleus (N) or mitochondria (M), or if a tRF can be attributed to both (NM). If ‘Exact $\mathrm{{{S/E}^{,}}}$ is checked, tRFs with exact start and end positions on the reference tRNAs are returned. Otherwise, all tRFs that are included in the range [Start:End] will be shown. Partial input of ‘tRF $\mathbf{ID}^{\prime}$ (as defined in Materials and Method) is allowed. tatDB also allows users to search tRFs by sequence, tRFs that contain the entire input sequence without mismatches will be displayed.  

Various filters on targets could be specified to query target RNAs crosslinked with tRFs in vivo in Ago1. Many RNA types have been found paired with tRFs in Ago, and although the biological interpretation of pairs with non-mRNAs is unclear, we included them for completeness. Thus, different target types including mRNA, rRNA, miRNA and lincRNA may be selected. Other types of transcripts annotated in Ensembl genome browser 91, such as snoRNA, snRNA, pseudogene (PG) and processed transcript (PT), are grouped as ‘Other’. The Region filter allows one to find targets in exons (including $5^{\prime}$ UTR, CDS and $3^{\prime}$ UTR) or intronic regions. Users can look for interactions of tRFs with a given gene; if ‘Exact name’ is unchecked, partial input of ‘Gene Name’ is allowed. Targets can be queried using a Sequence field, target RNAs containing the complete input sequence are returned with their paired tRFs.  

Additional query criteria include: (i) range of the minimum free energy (MFE) of the interaction of tRF and target sequence, (ii) direction of the pair of tRF and target RNA in the CLASH chimeric read as defined earlier (18), (iii) minimum number of CLASH reads supporting every unique hybrid, (iv) minimum number of unique hybrids for a target gene, (v) tRFs containing motifs. Based on the tRF parameter distribution and to show high-confidence interactions, we provided some useful default filters (target

# List of tRF–target pairs  

Search results are output in a text table, where every line represents a unique hybrid found in CLASH between a tRF sequence and a target sequence (Figure 1B). In many cases, CLASH chimeras for a given tRF have been found to contain overlapping subsequences of the same target gene, different by only a few end nucleotides. Such pairs of a tRF and different subsequences of the same gene are considered as different unique hybrids and presented in lines with the same background color in the result table. Additionally, counts of forward and reverse chimeras for the same pair are listed. The MFE value is a hyperlink to a page with the secondary structure of the given tRF–target pair and other details of the unique hybrid (Figure 1C, D).  

# List of all target genes for a given tRF isoform  

A column ‘From-To’ refers to the start and end of a tRF: for a given tRNA gene this coordinate uniquely identifies a tRF. A hyperlink in this column directs users to a page with detailed information for such tRF, including its sequence, host gene and PAR-CLIP matches (Figure 2). If a motif was identified for this tRF (6,18), its logo is shown and the motif is highlighted in red in the tRF sequence. $\mathrm{T}>\mathrm{C}$ conversions (sites of likely Ago cross-linking, usually not involved in the target binding) identified in human PAR-CLIP datasets are underlined next to their frequencies (Figure 2A). Due to the discrepancies in the library preparation steps of different experiments which cause tRF length variation, we aligned $\mathrm{T}>\mathrm{C}$ conversion sites in PAR-CLIP datasets to tRFs identified in CLASH (18), since they seem to appear in the same locations in different isoforms. Thus, although $\mathrm{T}>\mathrm{C}$ conversions are shown for a particular tRF isoform, it is to simply indicate their positions relative to the motif, as that exact tRF isoform is not always observed in PAR-CLIP datasets.  

If a tRF isoform could be mapped to different tRNAs, a section of all alternative mappings will be shown (Fig

ure 3). As an example, we take one of the most studied tRF LeuAAG-001-N-3p-68–85 (tRFdb ID: 3001a), which can also be mapped to the $3^{\prime}$ end of LeuTAG tRNA. Hyperlinks to the different tRNAs are provided to show the mapping of such tRF to the tRNA along with other tRFs-3p (see more details in next Section).  

Target genes binding to this tRF isoform are listed below (Figure 2D, E). Filters selected in the search page are automatically applied and they may be modified on this page to show specific set of target genes, e.g. only mRNA targets. In many cases, a gene may be targeted by a tRF in multiple positions. On this page, only one target position which has strongest pairing with the tRF (with minimum MFE) is shown. Gene name hyperlinks to a new page to view all target sites and their hybrids with the tRF.  

# Database interoperability, linking to tatDB  

As different sources of data on tRFs appear, it is important to allow for collecting facts about these molecules across databases. Currently, different databases of tRFs have their own naming conventions, e.g. 3001a in tRFdb is named tRF-18-HR0VX6D2 in MINTbase. Such tRF IDs are hard to interpret or match and they may cause difficulties in linking them. To allow for meaningful connections, we provided a simple and reliable mechanism based on a common currency of tRFs––their sequence. If the sequence of a tRF is known, one can simply link from any other source to its tatDB page with details of the tRF and all target genes by referring to the page (such as shown in Figures 2 and 3) using the tRF sequence in the URL: https://grigoriev-lab.camden.rutgers.edu/tatdb/trf isoform. php?guide seq $\c=$ ATCCCACCGCTGCCACCA.  

To view all binding sites on a gene targeted by a known tRF, one can refer to the page with the tRF sequence and gene name in the URL, for example: https://grigorievlab.camden.rutgers.edu/tatdb/trf gene.php?guide seq $\c=$ CTCACCTGGAGCATGTTTTCT&gene name $\c=$ RPL4.  

Default filters will be selected for such links if no filter is specified in the URL or in the previous search step. Further, filter settings may be changed after landing on the tatDB page.

# Alignments of all identified tRFs to a given tRNA sequence  

Hyperlink of the tRF type in Figure 3 directs to a page to show the alignments of a specific type of tRFs to a given tRNA gene (Figure 4, Supplementary Figure S1 & Supplementary Figure S2). In-page filters can be set to view tRF isoforms with certain read count and unique hybrids. tRF3t to different $3^{\prime}$ trailers of a given tRNA isoform are shown separately on the same page (Supplementary Figure S1).  

In order to identify all possible tRFs from either mature or immature tRNAs, we include tRNAs sequences with or without introns in the reference database to search tRFs (see Materials and Method). We herein showed an example that tRF-i could origin from both exon–intron junctions and exon–exon junctions in IleTAT-005-N (Supplementary Figure S2) although the significance of such tRFs remain to be elucidated further by experiments.  

# DISCUSSION  

Some recently described resources have attempted to catalogue tRF and target interactions. In tRFtar (36) and tRFtarget (38), tRFs have been retrieved from existing databases for tRFs (34,44) with binding targets computationally predicted in the whole human transcriptome in tRFtarget. It appears that only five tRF–target interactions observed in CLASH have been manually curated in tRFtarget (38). Targets in tRFtar (36) have been further restricted to those found in CLIP datasets. Although 772 tRF–target interactions in CLASH have been included (yet not available for querying), none of the five most abundant interactions curated in tRFtarget (38) could be found in tRFtar (36) at the time of writing this paper.  

Also, these two databases rely on the tRFs annotated in existing databases, and that presents a major limitation. For example, MINTbase (34) seems to contain only tRFs derived from mature tRNAs. A limited number of tRFs derived from the $3^{\prime}$ trailer sequence of pre-tRNAs are annotated in tRFdb (44) but at least one of the experimentally validated tRF-3t (12) is not in it. The other two recently published databases, tsRBase (35) and tsRFun (37), have identified tRFs de novo by aligning reads in small RNA sequencing datasets to tRNAs from GtRNAdb (1). tsRBase (35) identified 3,298 tRF–target interactions in CLASH and CLEAR but neither the five curated CLASH interactions in tRFtarget (38) nor the abundant tRF-3t (12,18) have been detected in this study. The same problem exists for tsRFun (37) in that the tRF–target interaction set they identified from CLASH data was far from complete. Another limitation is that none of the databases above specifically focuses on the tRF binding motifs, which could provide insights into the mechanism of interaction with tRF targets and explain the biology of these novel potential regulators.  

Validated tRF–target interactions are currently limited compared to the large number of published CLIP-seq or RNA-seq datasets, which can detect only guide or target RNA molecules but not their pairs. Thus, a computational prediction of tRF targets is a widely employed strategy to investigate the functions of tRFs. Based on the assumption that tRFs act akin to miRNAs, several miRNA target predictors have been used for tRFs, e.g, TargetScan in Maute et al. (10), miRanda in Zhang et al. (14) and RNA22 in Kuscu et al. (5), all with a high proportion of false positives. RNAhybrid has been utilized to calculate the MFE for tRFs binding to target candidates, selected, e.g. from transcripts co-expressed with the tRFs, or from the whole mRNA transcriptome (35–38), also with limited success in predicting interactors.  

Without a high-confidence true positive dataset for algorithm training, these unsupervised methods apparently have high false positive rates resulting in most predictions failing to be experimentally validated. tatDB provides a variety of features for the tRF–target pairs detected in the Ago1 and flexible query interface for the users to quickly pick up high-ranked tRFs for experiments. Moreover, these features and scores (e.g. the sequences, binding sites and their corresponding motifs) for numerous tRF–target pairs in tatDB may serve as a basis of high-value true positive set for developing a tRF-specific target predicting algorithm, urgently needed in this field of study.

Different tRNA isodecoders and isoacceptors have common sub-sequences of high similarity. To identify all possible tRFs, those tRNA sequences are all included in the search database. While others have often employed similar strategy of having a redundant search database, the advantage of tatDB is that we clearly list all mappings (Figure 3B) for a given tRF and their coordinates in each tRNA isoform can be easily traced and viewed on the graphical alignment page (Figure 4). In addition, tRNA genes are highly repeated on the genome. Most identical tRNA isoforms also have identical $3^{\prime}$ trailer sequences, yet there are some exceptions (e.g. HisGTG tRF-3t as shown in Supplementary Figure S1), where the trailer sequences are different for tRNA genes with identical body sequences. Our database provides a user-friendly means to view the origins of such tRFs graphically.  

As tRF-3t have been reported to be generated from the $3^{\prime}$ trailer sequences of pre-tRNAs, one should consider the pre-tRNAs as the source of other types of tRFs. In most existing databases (35–38), tRNA introns are simply removed from the tRNAs and only mature tRNA sequences are used as reference to look for tRFs. We observed tRFs mapped to tRNA introns (18), although their significance is yet unclear due to the paucity of sequenced reads (and hence lack of motifs) for such cases in the available CLASH data. Our database is the first attempt to clearly represent all those intron-derived tRFs so that they can be easily compared to the tRFs spliced cross the exon-exon junctions (Supplementary Figure S2).  

As an additional illustration of the utility of tatDB, we provide here an example of a possible hypothesis generation for interpreting of the results of the current active research in coronavirus. We have noted earlier various factors linking the features of the SARS-CoV-2 genome with short RNAs (45), and were also intrigued by an observation of a significant increase in tRF levels in patient samples (46). Although the tRF IDs in that paper do not match ours, we performed a sequence search of a highly upregulated ${\sim}35$ fold) tRF5-Leu-AAG in tatDB and identified RPL18A as a potential target. RPL18A showed the highest number of unique hybrids (for sequence GGUAGCGUGGCCGAGC and two other isoforms extended by 1 and 2 nts), supported by the highest number of reads, compared to other targets. Following up on the target, intriguingly, we found that this protein may play a role in translation of another RNA virus (hepatitis $\textrm{C}$ virus) by interacting with its internal ribosome entry site (47). Given the reorganization of host translation by both viruses, could this link $\mathbf{\dot{\tau}}_{\mathrm{{tRF}}}>\mathbf{RPL}18\mathbf{A}>$ translation’ be relevant for the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle as well? Although the final answer should be produced by an experiment, this hypothesis is generated from a straightforward use of tatDB, and we expect multiple similar cases of utilization of this resource by the research community.

# ABSTRACT  

Expression profiles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) across diverse biological conditions provide significant insights into their biological functions, interacting targets as well as transcriptional reliability. However, there lacks a comprehensive resource that systematically characterizes the expression landscape of human lncRNAs by integrating their expression profiles across a wide range of biological conditions. Here, we present LncExpDB (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/lncexpdb), an expression database of human lncRNAs that is devoted to providing comprehensive expression profiles of lncRNA genes, exploring their expression features and capacities, identifying featured genes with potentially important functions, and building interactions with protein-coding genes across various biological contexts/conditions. Based on comprehensive integration and stringent curation, LncExpDB currently houses expression profiles of 101 293 highquality human lncRNA genes derived from 1977 samples of 337 biological conditions across nine biological contexts. Consequently, LncExpDB estimates lncRNA genes’ expression reliability and capacities, identifies 25 191 featured genes, and further obtains 28 443 865 lncRNA-mRNA interactions. Moreover, user-friendly web interfaces enable interactive visualization of expression profiles across various conditions and easy exploration of featured lncRNAs and their interacting partners in specific contexts. Collectively, LncExpDB features comprehensive integration and curation of lncRNA expression profiles and  

# thus will serve as a fundamental resource for functional studies on human lncRNAs.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Accumulating evidences have shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can act in cis or trans to perform diverse functions including regulating gene transcription and RNA splicing, modulating the activity or abundance of RNAs and proteins, and organizing nuclear domains (1). They are extensively implicated in cell-fate programming/reprogramming (2), differentiation (3), development (4) and especially in human diseases (5–7). While hundreds of thousands of human lncRNAs have been identified primarily attributable to the rapid development of high-throughput sequencing technology in recent years, only a small subset of them have been well characterized (8–10).  

Nowadays, RNA-seq data are generated at exponential rates and scales, enabling the identification of lncRNAs and investigation of their expression profiles and accordingly providing the most direct evidence for identifying their potential functions across various biological conditions (11). Compared with mRNAs, particularly, lncRNAs feature higher tissue-specificity (12) and wider subcellular localizations (13), indicating their specific biological roles in gene expression regulation. Accordingly, multiple databases have been developed to integrate lncRNA expression profiles from different aspects. However, these databases have several limitations. First, they focus on specific biological contexts, e.g. normal and cancer tissue/cell (e.g. LncBook, RefLnc) (9,12,14–18), organ development (e.g. lncRNAtor) (17,19), subcellular localization (e.g. LncATLAS) (20) or exosome (e.g. NONCODE, exoRBase) (18,21). To our knowledge, lncRNA expression is associated with at least nine biological contexts of general interests, including normal tissue/cell line, cancer tissue/cell line, subcellular localization, exosome, cell differentiation, preimplantation embryo, organ development, circadian rhythm and virus infection. Second, existing databases have different numbers of lncRNAs with different annotation/curation criteria adopted (e.g. 140k lncRNA genes in LncBook (9), $16\mathrm{k}$ in Expression Atlas (22); see a review in (11)), leading to the inconsistency of functional lncRNAs as well as their annotations. Third, none of them fully characterizes expression features of lncRNAs, including expression level, specificity, breadth, capacity, and co-expression network. Considering massive RNA-seq datasets across diverse conditions publicly available, it is desirable to have a dedicated expression database that comprehensively integrates expression profiles and systematically characterizes expression features of human lncRNAs.  

To this end, we developed LncExpDB (https://bigd.big. ac.cn/lncexpdb), an expression database of human lncRNAs. Based on manual curation and standardized analysis, LncExpDB features comprehensive integration of highquality expression profiles of human lncRNAs across diverse biological contexts and conditions. It estimates a wide range of expression features for each lncRNA gene, characterizes potentially functional lncRNAs and identifies lncRNA–mRNA interactions by co-expression networks (Figure 1). Moreover, LncExpDB is equipped with userfriendly web interfaces, providing functionalities for data query, browsing, visualization as well as easy access.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# LncRNA gene integration and curation  

LncRNA transcripts were integrated from LncBook v1.2 (9), RefLnc (12), GENCODE v33 (23), CHESS v2.2 (24), FANTOM-CAT (25) and BIGTranscriptome (26), and curated with the following three steps: (i) To obtain a high-confidence lncRNA reference, redundant/questionable/incomplete transcripts were removed. Specifically, GffCompare (27) was used to compare different lncRNA entries and identify redundancy, mapping error, possible pre-mRNA fragment and polymerase run-on, which are allocated as $\mathbf{\dot{\Psi}}=\mathbf{\dot{\Psi}}$ , ‘s’, ‘e’ and ‘p’, respectively. Single-exon transcripts that are part of multi-exon transcripts and located in their exon regions and transcripts with very short exons $(<15\mathrm{nt})$ at the $5^{\prime}$ and $3^{\prime}$ ends, were considered as incomplete transcripts. (ii) We further identified lncRNAs based on their sequence length and coding potential. Transcripts shorter than $200~\mathrm{nt}$ were excluded. Four algorithms, namely, LGC (28), CPC2 (29), CPAT (30) and PLEK (31), were used for coding potential estimation; transcripts identified as lncRNAs by at least three algorithms were retained. iii) To provide a reliable list of human lncRNAs, lncRNAs that have no strand information were removed. Consequently, a total of 331 244 lncRNA transcripts were obtained. It is noted that LncBook integrated lncRNAs from GENCODE v27, NONCODE v5.0, LNCipedia v4.1, MiTranscriptome beta and HGNC (9), and about 10 databases thus have contributed to the lncRNA integration of LncExpDB, indicating a comprehensive coverage of human lncRNA resources.  

Following the strategy used for the assignment of lncRNA transcripts (32,33), transcripts sharing exonic sequences in the same strand are linked together and considered as the same gene, and we assigned lncRNA transcripts into gene loci using GffCompare (27). Thus, a highconfidence list of 101 293 lncRNA genes were obtained. Accordingly, curated annotations of lncRNA genes as well as protein-coding genes were merged and derived from the above databases and GENCODE v33, respectively.  

# RNA-seq data collection  

A total of 24 RNA-seq datasets across 1977 samples were collected from GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ gds/), SRA (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) and ArrayExpress (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/), covering 337 biological conditions of nine important biological contexts, including normal tissue/cell line, organ development, preimplantation embryo, cell differentiation, subcellular localization, exosome, cancer cell line, virus infection and circadian rhythm. The detailed information for each dataset is summarized in Supplementary Table S1.  

# Read mapping, quantification and normalization  

A standardized RNA-seq analysis pipeline was employed for all samples. Specifically, Trimmomatic (version 0.39) (34) was used to filter out low-quality reads and remove the adapters. STAR (version 2.7.1a) (35) was used to map the sequencing reads to the human reference genome (version hg38/GRCh38 from UCSC). The uniquely mapped reads were counted using featureCounts (version 2.0.0) (36) with a strand-specific parameter ‘-s’. Kallisto (version 0.46.1) (37) was used to quantify transcript-level abundances of all samples. Considering the robustness of the TMM (weighted trimmed mean of $M\cdot$ -values) method in read counts normalization (38), TMM in the package edgeR (39) was used to normalize read counts for samples within the same project.  

# Gene expression analysis  

To obtain the normalized expression levels, TPM (transcripts per million), FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads) and CPM (counts per million) were calculated (publicly accessible at https://bigd. big.ac.cn/lncexpdb/downloads). Expression values of both lncRNA genes and mRNA genes were averaged among biological replicates. All expressed genes (averaged expression values $\geq1$ TPM) were further ranked under a specific condition (time point/stage/tissue/cell/component/process); genes whose expression values are greater than the upper quantile are considered as $\mathbf{\nabla}^{\cdot}\mathbf{H}^{\cdot}$ (high expression level), those less than the lower quantile as $\mathbf{\bar{L}}^{\mathbf{\Delta}}$ (low expression level), and the remaining as $\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{M}^{\mathbf{\nabla}}$ (medium expression level). Highcapacity lncRNAs (HCL) are defined as lncRNA genes that have the potential to be highly expressed and thus should have at least one H among all conditions, low-capacity lncRNAs (LCL) are those that have L in all conditions, and the remaining are medium-capacity lncRNAs (MCL).  

Furthermore, featured genes were identified by using maSigPro (40) with significant time-course expression patterns ( $R$ -square $\geq0.7$ and $P$ -value $<0.05$ across different time points/stages. By using the index $\boldsymbol{\uptau}$ (41), time point/stage-specific genes and tissue/cell-specific genes were defined as those with $\tau\geq0.9$ . Consistently expressed genes were defined as those with $\tau\leq0.35$ . Additionally, specifically expressed genes or consistently expressed genes were strictly screened out with maximum expression values greater than 10 TPM. Differentially expressed genes ( $\lVert\mathbf{og}_{2}$ fold change| $\geq1$ and adjusted $P$ -value $<0.05$ ) for virus infection and exosomes were identified with the help of DeSeq2 (42). Organelle-enriched genes were defined as specifically highly expressed genes for each subcellular organelle/compartment compared with the whole cell $(\log_{2}$ fold change $\geq1$ and adjusted $P$ -value $\mathbf{\left(FDR\right)<0.05}$ , with more stringent criteria than the study $(\mathrm{FDR}<0.05$ ) from which our data was derived (43). Circadian genes were identified (meta2d, $\mathbf{BH.Q<0.05}]$ using the software MetaCycle (44).

Figure 1. Data curation and analysis workflow of LncExpDB. LncExpDB curates and analyzes expression profiles of human lncRNAs across diverse biological contexts/conditions based on comprehensive integration, accurate quantification and specialized analysis, to systematically characterize expression signatures and identify featured lncRNA genes.  

# LncRNA-mRNA interaction prediction  

LncRNA-mRNA interactions were predicted by coexpression networks, which were identified using the Pearson correlation coefficient ( $P$ -value $\mathit{\Theta}<\ 0.01$ and $|{\boldsymbol{r}}|$ $\ge0.5\}$ . Nearly all datasets were used for co-expression network construction, except the dataset of ‘COVID patients vs. normal control’, due to extremely smaller sampling size ${\mathit{n}}=4{\mathit{\Sigma}}$ .  

# Implementation  

LncExpDB was built with String Boot (https://spring. io/projects/spring-boot) as backend web framework and MySQL (https://www.mysql.com/) as database engine. Web interfaces were developed by JSP (Java Script Pages) and AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML). Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/) was adopted as a frontend framework, providing a series of templates for designing web pages with consistent interface components. Also, data visualization was rendered by Highcharts (https: //www.highcharts.com.cn/), Echarts (http://echarts.apache. org/zh/index.html), Plotly.js (https://plotly.com/javascript/), DataTables (https://datatables.net/) and UCSC Genome Browser (45).  

# DATABASE CONTENTS AND FEATURES  

LncExpDB presents a comprehensive and high-quality collection of 101 293 human lncRNA genes (corresponding to 331 244 transcripts). It houses abundant expression profiles of these lncRNAs across 337 biological conditions that fall into nine important biological contexts, involving normal tissue/cell line, cancer cell line, subcellular localization, exosome, cell differentiation, preimplantation embryo, organ development, circadian rhythm and virus infection. Moreover, LncExpDB identifies 25 191 featured lncRNA genes and characterizes 28 443 865 co-expression interactions between 24 508 lncRNA genes and 17 345 mRNA genes. The reference list of 101 293 lncRNA genes, lncRNA genes/transcripts’ expression values as well as their expression analyzed results are all publicly available at https:// bigd.big.ac.cn/lncexpdb/downloads.  

# LncRNA expression profiles  

Based on comprehensive expression profiles across multiple biological contexts, LncExpDB features value-added curation and analysis to provide reliably transcribed lncRNA genes. Consequently, we find that 92 016 lncRNA genes $(90.8\%)$ are supported with reliable transcriptional evidence (threshold of expression value is 1 TPM), distributing unevenly across the nine biological contexts (Figure 2A). Among the reliably transcribed genes, the majority $(82.6\%)$ are expressed in at least two biological contexts, and 3318 lncRNAs $(3.6\%)$ are expressed in all the nine contexts (Figure 2B).  

Moreover, considering massive expression profiles across abundant conditions in LncExpDB, we define highcapacity lncRNAs (HCL) as those that have the potential to be highly expressed (see Materials and Methods) in at least one biological condition. Therefore, HCL are those whose expression values are greater than the upper quantile in at least one condition. Likewise, low-capacity lncRNAs (LCL) are those whose expression values are always less than lower quantile in all biological conditions, and the remaining are medium-capacity lncRNAs (MCL). The expression levels for inferring expression capacities of the 101 293 lncRNAs across 337 biological conditions are available at https://bigd. big.ac.cn/lncexpdb/downloads. Our analyzed results show that, among the 92 016 expressed lncRNA genes across the nine biological contexts, $34\%$ are HCL, $55.7\%$ are MCL, and $10.3\%$ are LCL and that $74.8\%$ of HCL are specifically highly expressed under only one biological context (Figure 2C). However, the number of HCL does not change so much (336 genes are absent) without considering the context of cancer cell line, which show abnormal transcriptional regulation for a large number of genes. Although lncRNAs are often believed to be lowly expressed (12), these results indicate that one third of them have the capacity to be highly expressed under certain conditions and play important functions accordingly.  

# Featured lncRNA genes  

LncExpDB characterizes featured lncRNA genes that are specifically expressed in a certain cell line/tissue, differentially expressed in the context of cancer or virus infection, enriched in a specific organelle, dynamically expressed during cell differentiation or embryo/organ development, or periodically expressed with circadian rhythm. These featured genes are most likely to exert important functions under specific conditions (see details in Materials and Methods). Based on massive RNA-seq data, a total of 25 191 featured lncRNAs are identified, including 7922 in organ development, 7498 in normal tissue/cell line, 5292 in subcellular localization, 4343 in preimplantation embryo, 2907 in cancer cell line, 1740 in circadian rhythm, 1538 in exosome, 1232 in cell differentiation and 985 in virus infection (Figure 2D).  

LncExpDB provides easy access to all identified featured lncRNAs, thereby helpful for users to perform in-depth investigations on lncRNAs that are specifically expressed in some conditions or involved in specific biological contexts. Importantly, most featured lncRNA genes are present in one biological context, while most protein-coding genes are featured in two or three biological contexts (Figure 2E). Nevertheless, 6362 lncRNA genes are found to be involved in at least two biological contexts. For example, three contexts, viz., organ development, normal tissue/cell line, and cancer cell line, share 191 featured lncRNA genes (Figure 2F), presumably providing important insights into their functional roles in regulating the development of normal tissues and cancers.  

LncRNAs present a wider range of subcellular localizations (localized in nuclear, or cytoplasm, or both) compared with mRNAs (generally exported to the cytoplasm), and subcellular localizations, especially the enrichment/specific localization, provides valuable insights into cellular roles of lncRNAs (13). Based on data curation and analysis, we identify lncRNAs that show specific localizations and find that majority of these lncRNAs are enriched in nuclear (including nucleus, nuclear lamina and nucleolus) (Figure 2G). Among them, two well-characterized lncRNAs, MALAT1 and NEAT1, are significantly enriched in five subcellular compartments. As circadian-associated lncRNA genes show large overlap with the enriched genes of cellular compartments (Figure 2D), we further investigated the distribution of the overlapped genes. We found the overlapped lncRNA genes are specifically enriched in nuclear lamina and nucleus, whereas the overlapped mRNA genes exhibit a wider distribution (Figure 2G), indicating different roles of lncRNAs and mRNAs in regulation of circadian rhythms.  

# LncRNA–mRNA interactions  

To facilitate in-depth investigations on molecular mechanisms of featured lncRNAs, LncExpDB predicts lncRNA– mRNA interactions by co-expression networks. Totally, LncExpDB houses 28 443 865 predicted lncRNA–mRNA interactions; the majority of these interactions $(96.4\%)$ are present in one biological context, and there are 12 interactions found in five contexts (Figure 2H).  

Interestingly, TUG1 (https://bigd.big.ac.cn/lncexpdb/ gene?geneid $\c=$ HSALNG0134930), one of the extensively studied lncRNAs, is found to be highly interacted in five contexts (organ development, cell differentiation, subcellular localization, exosome and circadian rhythm) and is co-expressed with seven mRNAs in all the five contexts (Figure 2I). Also, TUG1 is frequently co-expressed with 114 mRNAs under at least four contexts (Figure 2I) (Supplementary Table S2), and these mRNAs are significantly enriched in processes of transcription regulation and cell cycle (data not shown). Additionally, among the 114 mRNAs, DDX17 and IFT27 are located on the same chromosome (chr22), 750 and $578~\mathrm{kb}$ distant from the locus of TUG1, respectively.  

# Data organization and access  

The central entities of LncExpDB are lncRNA genes, and each lncRNA gene has a corresponding page, consisting of two main parts, viz., basic information (e.g. gene symbol, genome context, length, exon number, classification and corresponding transcripts information), and expression profiles. For each lncRNA, LncExpDB profiles its gene expression landscape across all collected conditions and visualizes its expression profiles in an interactive manner. It organizes all relevant data in a structured manner to facilitate gene-, dataset- and context-based data browse/search. It enables visualization of various expression profiles of a specific lncRNA in one page, facilitates exploration of featured genes and their related coexpression networks, and provides useful functionalities for capturing expression landscape across different biological conditions.

# DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS  

LncExpDB is dedicated to the integration and curation of human lncRNAs, identification and characterization of featured genes with potentially important functions, and construction of co-expression interactions with protein-coding genes across various biological contexts/conditions. Based on comprehensive integration, stringent curation, and systematic analysis of massive RNA-seq datasets, LncExpDB has great potential in deepening our understanding of lncRNAs’ functions and thus serves as a valuable resource for the global research community. Future directions are to include more datasets (such as TCGA (46) and GTEx (47)) and accordingly to increase more diversity of biological contexts/conditions such as immune reaction, drug therapy, and also single-cell resolution. Meanwhile, in-depth expression profile analysis will be conducted by association with other omics data. Given the complexity and diversity of lncRNA–mRNA interactions, we are considering to characterize the lncRNA-involved interactions with protein, RNA, DNA and compound through analyzing other high-throughput sequencing data (e.g. CLIP-seq, SPLASH and PARIS) and literature curation. In addition, more userfriendly interfaces and tools will be developed and enhanced in aid of functional annotation, correlation analysis and interactive visualization of various expression profiles.

# ABSTRACT  

Inhibitors that form covalent bonds with their targets have traditionally been considered highly adventurous due to their potential off-target effects and toxicity concerns. However, with the clinical validation and approval of many covalent inhibitors during the past decade, design and discovery of novel covalent inhibitors have attracted increasing attention. A large amount of scattered experimental data for covalent inhibitors have been reported, but a resource by integrating the experimental information for covalent inhibitor discovery is still lacking. In this study, we presented Covalent Inhibitor Database (CovalentInDB), the largest online database that provides the structural information and experimental data for covalent inhibitors. CovalentInDB contains 4511 covalent inhibitors (including 68 approved drugs) with 57 different reactive warheads for 280 protein targets. The crystal structures of some of the proteins bound with a covalent inhibitor are provided to visualize the protein–ligand interactions around the binding site. Each covalent inhibitor is annotated with the structure, warhead, experimental bioactivity, physicochemical properties, etc. Moreover, CovalentInDB provides the covalent reaction mechanism and the corresponding experimental verification methods for each inhibitor towards its target. High-quality datasets are downloadable for users to evaluate and develop computational methods for covalent drug design. CovalentInDB is freely accessible at http://cadd.zju.edu.cn/cidb/.

# INTRODUCTION  

Covalent inhibitors are usually small molecules that attach to enzymes through covalent bonds and inactive them temporarily or permanently. Typically, a covalent inhibitor contains an electrophilic functional group, which is commonly referred to as the ‘warhead’ (1) and can attack and form a reversible or irreversible covalent bond with a nucleophilic residue in the targeted protein (2). Because of the stronger covalent bonds, covalent drugs possess several advantages compared with traditional non-covalent drugs, such as higher potency, longer residence time and decreased drug resistance rate (3,4). However, covalent inhibitors have traditionally been considered to be problematic due to their potential off-target effects and toxicity issues (5), which makes pharmaceutical industry avoid to spend too much in this field for a long time. Fortunately, over the last decade 14 covalent drugs have been approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which makes researchers believe that the safety issues of covalent drugs could be tackled by rational structure design that combines the strengths of covalent and non-covalent modes of drug action (5,6).  

A large number of covalent inhibitors towards a wide variety of protein targets, such as kinases (7), RAS (8) and cathepsins (9), have been reported. In order to facilitate the rational design and development of covalent drugs, it is quite critical to collect and annotate the experimental data and structural information for covalent inhibitors. There are a number of public chemical biology databases, such as ChEMBL (10) and PubChem (11), providing experimental bioactivity data for small organic molecules. However, according to the data deposited in these databases, we are unable to know which ligands inhibit the target of interest through covalent mechanisms and which residues in a target are able to form a covalent bond with ligands. And this information is quite important for the study of covalent inhibitors. In 2017, Du et al. reported cBinderDB, the first online database for covalent binding compounds, which collected the information for 527 covalent binders and 190 related proteins (12). But unfortunately, cBinderDB is not accessible anymore. In this study, we developed Covalent Inhibitor Database (CovalentInDB), a comprehensive online resource for covalent inhibitors and related targets (Figure 1). To our knowledge, CovalentInDB is the only available and largest online database that collects the diverse information for covalent inhibitors, including the structures, bioactivity, reactive warheads, covalent reaction mechanisms and covalent-mechanism experimental verification methods for 4511 covalent inhibitors, and the binding nucleophilic residues, structures and functions of the 280 corresponding protein targets. In addition, CovalentInDB provides three data query approaches, including the textand sequence-based search engines for proteins and the structure-based search engine for inhibitors. CovalentInDB would provide valuable guidelines to the structure optimization and warhead selection for medicinal chemists and facilitate covalent drug discovery. Moreover, some computational algorithms for covalent drug design have been developed, such as covalent docking (13), binding free energy calculation (14,15), warhead reactivity prediction (16), covalent binding site prediction (17), etc. CovalentInDB can provide high-quality data to evaluate and develop computational algorithms for covalent drug design and screening. All in all, CovalentInDB is an integrated resource that provides useful information for the mechanism study of covalent inhibition and facilitates the design of covalent inhibitors.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Data collection and processing  

The information in CovalentInDB was collected from scientific literatures and several scientific databases, including PubChem (11), ChEMBL (10), DrugBank (18), PDB (19) and UniProt (20).  

First, the PubMed database was searched using the query keywords of ‘covalent’ and ‘irreversible’, and the publications that contain at least one of the keywords in their titles or abstracts were collected. The selected publications were manually inspected and the irrelevant publications were ruled out. The information of target proteins including protein names and species were retrieved from the collected publications. It should be noted that warheads, which determine the reactivity of covalent inhibitors, play a significant role in covalent inhibition (1). Then, the warhead for each covalent inhibitor was annotated based on the description in the corresponding publication and structural analysis. In addition, the structural transformation diagram during the covalent reaction for each warhead was also plotted according to the description reported in the literature. For each ligand–target pair, the binding site and the specific residue in the target to form the covalent bond with the inhibitor were also annotated. The binding affinity, bioactivity data, target selectivity and toxicity (if available) for covalent inhibitors were collected from PubChem, ChEMBL and the collected publications. All the protein targets in CovalentInDB were annotated with gene information, synonyms, biological functions and sequences extracted from UniProt and original publications. Moreover, the co-crystal structures bound with covalent inhibitors for some proteins were also retrieved from PDB. For those proteins without co-crystallized covalent inhibitors, other forms of structures were collected to indicate the targeted residues.  

The covalent inhibitors and drugs in CovalentInDB were annotated with molecular formula, molecular weight, IUPAC name, InChI and canonical SMILES. The 3D conformations of the inhibitors were generated by the Ligprep program in Schr¨odinger (21). The 2D and 3D sdf files for each inhibitor in CovalentInDB are downloadable. In addition, nine important physicochemical properties related to drug-likeness calculated by RDKit (22) and ALOGPS 2.1 (23) are provided for covalent inhibitors, including molecular weight, partition coefficient (logP), aqueous solubility (logS), heavy atom count, ring count, hydrogen bond acceptor count, hydrogen bond donor count, rotatable bond count and topological polar surface area (TPSA).  

# Quality assessment  

In order to provide an assessment criterion of the compounds in CovalentInDB, we developed a method to rank the compounds for each target according to their experimental validation methods, bioactivity and structure similarity. Generally, the covalent labeling of proteins can be validated by several experimental techniques, including X-ray crystallography, NMR, mutation validations, mass spectrometry, isotopes labeling assay, covalent binding competition assay, dialysis assay, time-dependency inhibition assay, etc. (2). Some experimental techniques, such as $\mathbf{X}$ -ray crystallography, NMR and mass spectrometry, can prove the covalent mechanism directly and detect the covalent binding residues on targets. But the other methods can only be used to verify irreversible covalent inhibition, and are not accurate enough to detect the nucleophilic residues. We retrieved this information from literatures and displayed it in the result table as ‘EXPERIMENT METHOD’.  

Those compounds, which have been proved to inhibit their targets through covalent-mechanism by any experimental technique, were labeled with ‘Three Stars’. Then we calculated the structural similarities between the ‘Three

Figure 1. The basic framework of CovalentInDB. Data in CovalentInDB were collected from the literature and several scientific databases, and subse quently manually inspected. Various forms of information are deposited in SQLite for online visualization and downloading.  

Stars’ compounds and the other compounds based on the Morgan fingerprints reported in the same publication. If the structural similarity of a compound is above 0.65 and the bioactivity is higher than a hundredth of the activity of the ‘Three Stars’ compound, it would be labeled with ‘Two Stars’, and the remaining compounds were labeled with ‘One Star’. In some publications, the reported compounds were hypothesized to act through covalent mechanism but no any experimental validation was provided. These compounds without experimental verification would be labeled with ‘One Star’.  

# Online database implementation  

CovalentInDB was designed as a relational database on an SQLite server that contains 12 tables. The website was built with the Django 2.7 framework with Python 3.6. 3Dmol.js, an object-oriented and WebGL-based JavaScript library for online molecular visualization, was embedded into the website to display the 3D structures of protein-ligand complexes and inhibitors (24). For each complex, the residue ID and chain ID of the ligand were extracted manually from the PDB file, and the surrounding residues within $5\mathring\mathrm{A}$ of the ligand were selected and visualized by 3Dmol.js to specifically display the protein–ligand interaction around the binding site. For each covalent inhibitor, the atoms of the warhead substructure were recognized by the SMARTS-based GetSubstructMatches function in RDKit (22), and then highlighted and labeled. The sequence alignment and similarity search of target proteins are powered by $\mathrm{BLAST}+2.2.3\dot{0}$ (25). The molecular structure sketcher of the ChemDoodle Web Components (26) was used as the molecular editor in CovalentInDB. Two chemical structure search engines are provided for self-edited structures: similarity-based search by the Tanimoto similarity based on the Morgan fingerprints and substructure search supported by RDKit.  

# RESULTS  

# Data statistics in CovalentInDB  

CovalentInDB is a comprehensive database for covalent inhibitors and their targets. It mainly contains two types of data: (i) proteins with the reactive residues and inherent covalent binding sites and (ii) small covalent inhibitors that bind to protein targets through experimentally validated covalent mechanisms. In total, the database collected the experimental data for 280 protein targets and 4511 covalent inhibitors (including 68 approved drugs) with 57 types of reactive warheads. The covalent-mechanisms of 842 compounds have been validated by experimental techniques and labeled with ‘Three Stars’. Besides, 913 compounds are labeled with ‘Two Stars’. The proteins in CovalentInDB cover 53 different species, of which $66\%$ of the covalently modified proteins are from human and $15\%$ from bacteria. The remaining proteins from virus, mouse, rat and pig make up $6\%$ , $3\%$ , $2\%$ and $1.5\%$ , respectively. The proteins in CovalentInDB were then classified by biological functions. We observed that the proteins in the kinase family are the most popular, and the covalent inhibitors towards kinases account for $28\%$ , and the next is proteases which make up 29 proteins, followed by $\upbeta$ - lactamases and endopeptidases (10 proteins for both). The covalent binding nucleophilic residues of 175 proteins in CovalentInDB were validated by experimental methods. Most targets $(53\%)$ form the covalent bonds with inhibitors through cysteine, and $25\%$ of the targets react with covalent inhibitors through serine. Other nucleophilic residues include lysine, histidine, threonine, tyrosine and enzyme cofactor. The numbers of the covalent inhibitors for different proteins in CovalentInDB are unbalanced. Apparently, some proteins attract much more attention than the others. For example, there are 689 and 468 covalent inhibitors for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and fatty-acid amide hydrolase 1, respectively. However, the numbers of the inhibitors for those less popular proteins will decrease sharply, such as histone deacetylase and prolyl endopeptidase. As shown in Figure 2, the top 10 protein targets are epidermal growth factor receptor, fattyacid amide hydrolase 1, receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2, tyrosine-protein kinase BTK, protein-glutamine $\upgamma$ - glutamyltransferase 2, acetylcholinesterase, protease 3C, neutrophil elastase, cysteine protease and monoglyceride lipase.

(C) The distributions of the electrophilic functional groups (warheads) of covalent inhibitors. (D) The distributions of the nucleophilic residues that form covalent bonds with inhibitors.  

Similarly, the numbers of the covalent inhibitors for different warheads are also unbalanced. A total of 2063 inhibitors $(45.7\%)$ form the covalent bonds with their targets through Michael acceptor as the electrophilic functional groups, which is the most popular warhead in CovalentInDB. Phosphonate is the second most popular warhead, and it is possessed by 287 covalent inhibitors. However, some warheads are only possessed by $<10$ inhibitors, such as oxadiazole, hydroxamic and oxime. The top 10 warheads are Michael acceptor (2063), phosphonate (287), nitrile (277), urea carbonyl (266), halohydrocarbon (204), carbonyl (159), carbamate (98), ketoamide (72) amino (66) and aldehydic carbonyl (65). According to our statistics, the molecular weight of $67\%$ of inhibitors is below 500, meeting the requirements of molecular weight suggested by the Lipinski’s ‘Rule of $5^{\circ}$ (27).  

# The search engines supported by CovalentInDB  

CovalentInDB provides a variety of interfaces for information retrieval and data visualization. Three data query approaches are supported by CovalentInDB: the textand sequence-based search engines for proteins and the structure-based search engine for inhibitors. To search for a target, users can simply enter its gene name, protein name or UniProt protein identifier in the search box and press the ‘Enter’ button. The proteins that contain the keywords in their names, synonyms and encoding genes will be listed on the result page, with the query words highlighted and hyperlinks to their full information pages. Users can also use the sequence-based search engine to find any homologous enzymes of a protein of interest that have ever been modified by covalent inhibitors by pasting a FASTA format sequence in the search box. CovalentInDB will recognize the format automatically and submit the search job to the BLAST+ program, resulting in a list of similar proteins in terms of identity, alignment length, E-score and bit-score. To search for covalent inhibitors, users can use the structure-based search engine by inputting a SMILES string, uploading a MOL/SDF structure file or sketching a molecule within the ChemDoodle editor. After the query molecule has been imported, one of the three searching options (i.e., similarity, substructure or exact) can be chosen, and the high-score hits will be ranked in a datasheet along with their structures, names, formula and related protein targets.  

# Information of targets and inhibitors  

The query results for proteins and covalent inhibitors are mainly organized into ‘Target Page’ and ‘Inhibitor Page’, respectively (Figure 3). In ‘Target Page’, a cocrystal structure of the protein bound with its covalent inhibitor is displayed and a molecular visualization function is embedded to display the protein-ligand interaction around the binding site, which provides valuable information to the structurebased design of targeted covalent inhibitors. The protein structure can be zoomed in to its protein–ligand binding pocket by checking ‘Site View’, and then, the residues within $\overset{\mathbf{\scriptscriptstyle1}}{5}\mathring\mathbf{A}$ around the inhibitor are shown as stick and labeled by their names and IDs. A semitransparent surface can also be added onto the whole structure or the binding pocket by checking ‘Show Surface’. For those proteins without the structures co-crystallized with covalent inhibitors, other forms of structures are displayed and can be zoomed to the targeted residues to help to understand the ligand accessibility. All the covalent inhibitors targeting this protein are listed in a table, along with their structures, IDs, rank, warheads, covalent reaction mechanism, reactive residues, bioactivity, experimental covalent-mechanism verification methods, bioassays and the hyperlinks to original publications. The hyperlink for each inhibitor will lead users to ‘Inhibitor Page’ by clicking ‘Structure’ or ‘ID’. ‘Inhibitor Page’ contains five sections: inhibitor representations, calculated properties, 3D structures, related targets, selectivity and toxicity (if available). The warhead substructure will be highlighted with a label by pressing the ‘Show Warhead’ button. CovalentInDB allows users to retrieve the similar inhibitors of a compound of interest and check their related targets, which can help users to evaluate off-target risk in the design of covalent inhibitors for a specific target. The ‘Selectivity’ section provides the bioactivity of this compounds on different targets, which is useful to evaluate its off-target risks.

(D) The calculated physicochemical properties, structure and highlighted warhead substructure of the inhibitor.  

# The browsing functions for quick data retrieval  

CovalentInDB also provides four data browsing functions to retrieve the information of interest more conveniently: ‘Warheads browse’, ‘Reaction mechanism browse’, ‘Binding sites browse’ and ‘Covalent drugs browse’ (Figure 4). ‘Warheads browse’ allows users to browse the list of all covalent inhibitors possessing a specific warhead. For each warhead, a molecular visualization program is embedded to highlight the warhead structure and a diagram is plotted to show the structural transformation during covalent reaction. Similarly, ‘Reaction mechanism browse’ allows users to retrieve all covalent inhibitors that bind to their targets through the same reaction mechanism. Moreover, users can retrieve all covalent inhibitors that bind to their targets through the same residue type or co-factor by ‘Binding sites browse’. ‘Covalent drugs browse’ provides a convenient way to summarize the information for each covalent drug. By selecting a drug of interest from the 68 approved drugs and clicking the ‘Submit’ button, the detailed information for this drug will be displayed. We believe biologists and chemists can gain a better understanding of how these successful drugs achieve covalent inhibition through this information. A ‘similarity search’ function is also available for users to retrieve the similar inhibitors of this drug collected in CovalentInDB, which may be valuable for the design and optimization of covalent inhibitors.

All data in CovalentInDB are downloadable for anyone who visits our website. In ‘Download Page’, users can download the covalent inhibition information according to targets, warheads and reaction mechanisms. A compressed file that contains all data is also provided by pressing the ‘Download All’ button.  

# DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  

In the past decade, a number of covalent drugs have been approved for the treatment of various clinical diseases, which made a remarkable positive impact on human health (28). However, it is worth noting that the action modes of most covalent drugs were discovered serendipitously rather than resulting from rational design (1). With the increasing amount of experimental data for covalent inhibition studies, there is an urgent need to collect and make good use of these scattered information for rational design of covalent inhibitors. Therefore, we built CovalentInDB, a manually curated database for covalent inhibitors. The latest version of CovalentInDB contains 4511 covalent inhibitors for 280 protein targets collected by comprehensive literature searching. We believe that both wet-lab and in silico researchers would greatly benefit from these data. First, medicinal chemists can search a specific target and quickly get the structures and bioactivity information of its covalent inhibitors, which can guide the structural optimization and warhead selection in covalent drug design. The co-crystal structures deposited in CovalentInDB can also provide valuable information to the structure-based design of targeted covalent inhibitors for proteins of interest. Second, computer-aided drug design is playing an increasingly important role in the discovery of covalent inhibitors (29). A high-quality dataset is essential for the development and evaluation of computational algorithms for covalent drug design, such as covalent docking, warhead reactivity prediction and covalent binding free energy calculation. To our knowledge, CovalentInDB is the only available database that can meet this requirement.  

We will continue to update the database to provide more extensive and accurate information of covalent inhibitors and related targets. Data in CovalentInDB will be updated every 6 months and a data uploading function will be added to CovalentInDB to allow users to upload their newly published data into the database. More experimental information of covalent inhibitors and computational tools will be added to CovalentInDB. For example, we are now collecting the crystal structures of proteins bound with covalent inhibitors in PDB. A systematic study of protein-ligand binding modes will be performed by integrating chemical genomics and structural genomics data. These data will be uploaded to CovalentInDB gradually for a better understanding of protein-ligand interactions. A covalent site identification and prediction function will be provided, and any uploaded protein can be analyzed and the residues that may be attacked by covalent inhibitors can be identified and visualized.

# ABSTRACT  

Natural product (NP) has a long history in promoting modern drug discovery, which has derived or inspired a large number of currently prescribed drugs. Recently, the NPs have emerged as the ideal candidates to combine with other therapeutic strategies to deal with the persistent challenge of conventional therapy, and the molecular regulation mechanism underlying these combinations is crucial for the related communities. Thus, it is urgently demanded to comprehensively provide the disease-specific molecular regulation data for various NP-based drug combinations. However, no database has been developed yet to describe such valuable information. In this study, a newly developed database entitled ‘Natural Productbased Drug Combination and Its Disease-specific Molecular Regulation (NPCDR)’ was thus introduced. This database was unique in (a) providing the comprehensive information of NP-based drug combinations & describing their clinically or experimentally validated therapeutic effect, (b) giving the diseasespecific molecular regulation data for a number of NP-based drug combinations, (c) fully referencing all NPs, drugs, regulated molecules/pathways by cross-linking them to the available databases describing their biological or pharmaceutical characteristics. Therefore, NPCDR is expected to have great implications for the future practice of network pharmacology, medical biochemistry, drug design, and medicinal chemistry. This database is now freely accessible without any login requirement at both official (https://idrblab.org/npcdr/) and mirror (http: //npcdr.idrblab.net/) sites.

# INTRODUCTION  

Compared with synthetic compounds, the natural products (NPs) show the unique advantages of metabolitelikeness (1), which makes them the main resource of marketed drugs (2). Recently, a variety of additional advantages of NPs have been identified, including good tolerability (3), low toxicity (4), poly-pharmacological modulation (5), etc. Due to these advantages, NP has emerged to be the ideal candidates to combine with other therapeutic agents for dealing with the persistent challenge of conventional therapies (6–8), which have then attracted tremendous research interest from worldwide scientists (9–11). Particularly, NP-based drug combinations are characterized by disease-specific molecular regulation (12,13), which make them able to achieve pharmacokinetic synergy by targeting multiple pathways or regulating the absorption, distribution, metabolism & excretion (ADME) profile of combined therapies (14,15), enhance the sensitivity of conventional therapy to disease cells or reversing drug resistance by acting in multi-specific manner (16), and reduce patients’ burden by lowering the effective dose of their accompanied therapies (6).  

With the rapid advance of this research direction, many studies have been conducted, which has accumulated valuable data for the researchers in the diverse fields of: Network Pharmacology to uncover the molecular mechanisms (synergistic, potentiative or antagonistic (17)) underlying the traditional medicines of Africa, China, India, Mexico (18– 20), Medical Biochemistry to identify disease marker (20), drug target (21) or target combination (22,23), and Medicinal Chemistry & Drug Design to discover new multitarget drug (24) or drug combination (25,26). To promote the development of these promising research directions, it is crucial to comprehensively collect the disease-specific molecular regulation data of NP-based drug combinations.  

So far, many valuable databases have been constructed to provide the NP-related data. As shown in Table 1, some of them describe the traditional medicines around the world and their active or inactive ingredients (labeled by ‘TI’ in the second column of Table 1; e.g. HERB (27), SymMap (28), VIETHERB (29), BIOFACQUIM (30), ETCM (31), NANPDB (32), NuBBE (33), TCMID (34), etc.); some others provide the structural characteristics and biological activities of each NP (labeled by ‘SB’ in the second column of Table 1; e.g. NPASS (35), CMAUP (36), COCONUT (37), etc.); the remaining ones collect various NP data from certain species and their phylogenetic distributions (labeled by ‘PD’ in the second column of Table 1; e.g. StreptomeDB (38), CMNPD (39), etc.). Although these NP-related databases have their unique data coverage (the last column of Table 1), none of them contains the NPbased drug combinations. For the available databases offering drug combination information (e.g. DCDB (40), DrugCombDB (41), etc.), none of them specifies the identity of NP, let alone describes the NP-induced clinical effect on the accompanied conventional therapies (especially drugs; the seventh column of Table 1). Thus, it is essential to have a new database that describes the molecular regulations of NP-based drug combinations.  

Herein, a newly constructed database, Natural Productbased Drug Combination and Its Disease-specific Molecular Regulation (NPCDR) was therefore introduced to provide the comprehensive molecular regulation data of NPbased drug combinations in various disease cell lines and model organisms. First, a number of clinically important drugs were collected from DrugBank (42) and TTD (43), and a systematic literature review on the NPs that were reported to combine with these drugs was conducted. As a result, the collected NP-based drug combinations (as shown in Figure 1) were found to (a) enhance drug efficacy by augmenting drug sensitivity (44,45) and achieving therapeutic synergy (46,47), (b) decrease the adverse drug reaction (48,49) and (c) reverse drug resistance (50,51). Second, the molecules or pathways regulated by these collected combinations were manually identified by additional literature review, and their regulation profiles (expression up/down-regulation, increased/decreased phosphorylation, etc.) were explicitly provided (shown in Figure 1). Finally, those data in NPCDR were fully cross-linked to well-established databases (UniProt (52), TTD (53), KEGG (54), NCBI Gene (55), VARIDT (56), BRENDA (57), INTEDE (58), TCDB (59), Pfam (60), Cellosaurus (61), miRbase (62), etc.) to facilitate the prediction of drug safety or sensitivity, the assessment of drug–drug interactions, and the discovery of detailed information for each NP or drug. Because of such unique characteristics and data provided online, NPCDR (https://idrblab.org/npcdr/) is expected to have great implications for the future practice of network pharmacology, medical biochemistry, medicinal chemistry and drug design.  

# FACTUAL CONTENT AND DATA RETRIEVAL  

# Collecting the regulation data for each combination  

NP-based drug combinations together with their diseasespecific molecular regulation data were collected using the sequentially steps shown below. First, a number of clinically important drugs were identified by retrieving from DrugBank (42) and TTD (43), which resulted in ${\sim}2000$ drugs approved by FDA, ${\sim}9000$ drugs in clinical trial, and ${\sim}1000$ preclinical or patented drugs. Second, $50000{\mathrm{NPs}}$ were retrieved from existing NP-related databases: NPACT (63), HERB (27), ETCM (31), SANCDB (64), NANPDB (32), BIOFACQUIM (30), NuBBE DB (33) and VIETHERB (29). Third, NP-based drug combinations were collected by the literature review in PubMed (55) using such keyword combinations: ‘[NP name] $^+$ drug combination’, ‘[NP name] $^+$ combination’, ‘[NP name] $^+$ synergistic effects’, ‘[NP name] $^+$ synergy’, ‘natural product $^+$ [drug name]’, and so on. As a result, 1172 NP-based drug combinations between $425~\mathrm{NPs}$ and 476 drugs were extensively identified and manually collected to the NPCDR database. Finally, the corresponding literatures of the newly collected NP-based drug combinations were carefully reviewed, and their regulating molecules and pathways (as illustrated in Figure 1) were recorded.  

# NP-based drug combinations and therapeutic effects  

Among those newly identified 1172 NP-based drug combinations, the vast majority $(93.5\%)$ of them were between one NP and one drug, and the remaining ones $(6.5\%)$ were the combinations among ${>}2$ NPs/drugs (with at least one NP in each combination). Such newly collected NPbased drug combinations were reported to treat the disease indications of 218 classes as defined by the latest International Classification of Diseases (65) released by World Health Organization. These indication classes belonged to the extremely diverse super-classes, which could be classified to: infections (e.g. influenza, malaria, hepatitis virus, etc.), neoplasms (e.g. melanoma, breast cancer, leukemia, thymoma, etc.), metabolic disorders (e.g. hypoandrogenism, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, etc.), metal disorders (e.g. depression, schizophrenia, anxiety, etc.), nervous system diseases (e.g. Parkinson, Alzheimer, etc.), visual system disorders (e.g. retinal vein occlusion, glaucoma, optic nerve contusion, etc.), circulatory system diseases (e.g. arrhythmias, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarct, etc.), respiratory disorders (e.g. COPD, pulmonary fibrosis, etc.), digestive diseases (e.g. diverticulosis, ulcerative colitis, gastric ulcer, etc.), musculoskeletal diseases (e.g. osteomyelitis, rheumatoid arthritis, etc.), genitourinary diseases (e.g. nephropathy, etc.), and so on. Furthermore, the clinical developmental statuses of the NPs, drugs and drug combinations that were collected from ClinicalTrials.gov (66), and TTD (43), were all provided in the NPCDR database.

The existence and non-existence of certain data type were indicated using $\mathrm{^{\circ}O}^{\prime}$ and $\mathbf{\epsilon}^{\star}\times\mathbf{\epsilon}^{\star}$ , respectively. The unique contents covered by each database were briefly described in the last column.  

The administration of drugs was reported to be significantly restricted by their limited therapeutic effect (67), adverse drug reaction (68), acquired drug resistance (69) and so on. Natural products were thus reported capable of (a) enhancing drug efficacy via augmenting its sensitivity (44,45) or achieving therapeutic synergy (46,47), (b) decreasing adverse drug reactions (48,49) and (c) reversing drug resistance (50,51). To have such valuable data about NP-based regulations in this database, the improved therapeutic effects of NP on their corresponding drug were reviewed and explicitly described in NPCDR. Particularly, 58 NPs were reported to augment the sensitivity of 66 drugs in 184 combinations for the treatment of 38 diseases; 370 NPs were found to achieve therapeutic synergies with 430 drugs in 921 combinations for treating 184 diseases; $64\mathrm{NPs}$ were reported to decrease the adverse reaction of 57 drugs in 84 combinations for the treatment of 44 diseases; ${57}\mathrm{NPs}$ were discovered to reverse the resistances of 33 drugs in 93 combinations for the treatment of 27 diseases. As shown in Figure 2, the therapeutic effect of each NP-based drug combination was described, and the corresponding experiments for clinically or experimentally validating such therapeutic effects were shown in NPCDR. All in all, NPCDR covered a number of NP-based drug combinations, and was the first source describing the therapeutic effects of NP on enhancing drug efficacy, decreasing adverse drug reactions or reversing drug resistance.

Figure 1. The unique contents and characteristics of NPCDR. The NPs were reported to enhance drug efficacy by augmenting drug sensitivity/achieve therapeutic synergy, decrease adverse drug reaction and reverse drug resistance. Thus, NPCDR is UNIQUE in providing the comprehensive NP-based drug combinations & describing their clinically/experimentally validated therapeutic effects, and describing the disease-specific regulations of molecules and pathways for a number of NP-based drug combinations.  

# Disease-specific regulation of molecules and pathways  

Disease-specific regulations of molecules and pathways by the collected drug combinations were carefully identified by literature review. Particularly, 518 molecules (primarily, protein and RNA) and 217 pathways (physiological or pathological) that were regulated by these drug combinations were provided in NPCDR. These regulated molecules were from 71 biochemical classes such as GPCR, peptidase, transcription factor, microRNA, kinase, ABC transporter and so on. As shown in Figure 3, the mechanisms of molecular regulations were explicitly described, which included the induction of protein degradation, the up/down-regulation of molecule’s expression, cleavage, activity, phosphorylation or ubiquitination, and so on. Apart from these molecular regulation data, the biological regulation data of some drug combinations had also been reported, which included the induction of cell cycle arrest, inhibition of metabolites biosynthesis, accumulation of reactive oxygen species, extension of clotting time, induction of DNA damage, and so on. All in all, such data of molecular & biological regulation were essential for the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the NPs’ therapeutic effects on a particular drug to enhance its efficacy, decrease its adverse reaction, or reverse its acquired resistance.  

![](images/1b2d220551984e07e84d304f33ffbbf9f621ad3ae335ecf91cc63d8d4a0eeefb.jpg)  
Figure 2. Combinatorial therapeutic effects that were clinically or experimentally validated. The NPs were reported able to enhance the drug efficacy b augmenting its sensitivity and achieving therapeutic synergy, decrease adverse drug reaction, and reverse drug resistance. The therapeutic effects of eac NP-based drug combination were thus described in the bottom panel (highlighted using the green frame) of this figure.  

As shown in Figure 3, all molecular & biological regulation data were described in NPCDR and linked to their in-vitro and in-vivo disease models (Figure 3), which made all the regulation data disease-specific and experimentallyverified (the disease names were identified according to the models applied in corresponding experiment, including different cell lines and model organisms). In total, 715 cell lines of a variety of disease & species origins together with 23 model organisms (including mouse, rat, rabbit, zebrafish, etc.) were collected in NPCDR to describe the regulation data of each drug combination. Moreover, a variety of experimental techniques that were applied to identify the molecular and biological regulations were also recorded, which included shRNA, siRNA, western-blot, qPCR, etc., and the analytical results of various experiments were recorded to give comprehensive information for each combination, and the extended descriptions on each regulated molecule can be accessed by clicking the ‘Molecule Info’ buttons given in Figure 3. Additionally, the pathways altered by the particular drug combination were also identified by the literature review. These identified pathways were then manually linked to available pathway data, such as KEGG (54), Reactome (70), Biocyc (71), SIGNOR (72) & Pathway Commons (73). All the regulated molecules were finally highlighted on their corresponding pathway maps (both the physiological and the pathological pathway maps).  

# Descriptions of the NP and drug in each combination  

For each natural product (NP), the detailed descriptions on its general information were provided in NPCDR. As illustrated in Figure 4, the descriptions included NP name, NP synonyms, species origin(s), applied disease indication(s), 3D and 2D molecular structures in various formats (MOL and PNG, both could be directly downloaded), and other molecular information associated with the external links to: PubChem (55), TTD (43), HERB (27), ETMC (31), SymMap (28), TCMSP (74), and so on. Meanwhile, the combinatorial therapeutic effects of a particular NP on a list of drugs that were clinically/experimentally validated, were also described (as shown in Figure 4). These accompanied drugs were grouped based on three types of NP’s combinatorial effects: (a) a list of drugs whose efficacy can be enhanced by this NP, (b) a list of drugs whose adverse effect can be decreased by this NP and (c) a list of drugs whose resistance can be reversed by this NP. Under each therapeutic effect, the regulated molecules and pathways, in-vivo and invitro models, together with the results of experimental validations were demonstrated (illustrated in Figure 4). Based on the information provided on the NP page of NPCDR, the users could readily retrieve a list of drugs whose therapeutic effects were improved by this particular NP.  

![](images/510955c7eae2b0929a4794d015ac892c5b02bf80017e7800927c08f6fd1f7132.jpg)  
Figure 3. Regulation of molecules and pathways by NP-based drug combinations. Mechanisms of molecular regulation were explicitly described (including the induction of protein degradation, the up or down-regulation of molecule’s cleavage, activity, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and expression). The biological regulation of drug combinations was also provided (e.g. the induction of cell cycle arrest, inhibition of metabolite biosynthesis, etc.). These regulation data were linked to their $\dot{m}$ -vitro or $\dot{\boldsymbol{{m}}}$ -vivo disease model, and an extended description on each regulated molecule could be accessed by clicking the ‘Molecule Info’ buttons.

Figure 4. The natural product (NP) page of this database. The general information (upper orange panel) and the combinatorial therapeutic effects of this NP (lower blue panel) were provided in NPCDR. Particularly, the combinatorial therapeutic effects of this NP on a list of drugs that were clinically/experimentally validated were shown. These accompanied drugs were grouped based on three types of combinatorial effects of NP: (a) a list of drugs whose efficacy can be enhanced by this NP, (b) a list of drugs whose adverse effects can be decreased by this NP and (c) a list of drugs whose resistance can be reversed by this NP.  

Similar to the NP page, the drug page of NPCDR also provided the general information of certain drug. Such general information included drug name, drug synonyms, molecular type, the applied disease indication(s), 3D and 2D drug structures in various formats (MOL and PNG, both formats were directly downloadable), and other molecular information associated with the external links to ChEBI (75), GDSC (76), DrugBank (42), TTD (43) and PubChem (55). In the meantime, the combinatorial therapeutic effects of a drug on a list of NPs that were clinically or experimentally validated, were described. These accompanied NPs were grouped by three combinatorial effects of a drug: (a) a list of NPs capable of enhancing the efficacy of this drug, (b) a list of NPs capable of decreasing the adverse reactions of this drug and (c) a list of NPs able to reverse the resistance of this drug. Under each therapeutic effect, the regulated molecules and pathways, and validating experimental models (in-vivo/in-vitro, various cell lines/model organisms & experimental details) were fully collected and described. Based on the information provided on the NPCDR drug page, the audiences could readily retrieve a list of natural products that were capable of improving the therapeutic effects (enhancing drug efficacy, decreasing adverse drug reactions, or reversing drug resistance) of the corresponding drug described on that particular drug page.  

# Standardization and customized retrieval of NPCDR data  

To make the access and analysis of NPCDR data convenient to all readers, the collected raw data were carefully cleaned up and then systematically standardized. These standardizations included: (a) all NPCDR diseases were standardized using the latest version of International Classification of Disease that was officially released by the World Health Organization (65); (b) all NPs, drugs, proteins, RNAs, pathways, cell lines, species and disease indications in this database were fully cross-linked to a number of well-established databases (UniProt (52), BRENDA (57), TTD (53), Pfam (60), KEGG (54), VARIDT (56), NCBI Gene (55), Cellosaurus (61), TCDB (59), INTEDE (58), miRbase (62), etc.), which could facilitate the prediction of drug safety or sensitivity, drug-drug interactions, and so on. These databases could also help to discover the detailed information for each molecule in this database. All NP-based drug combination data can be viewed, assessed, and downloaded from the NPCDR website, which is freely assessable without login requirement by all users at its official (https: //idrblab.org/npcdr/) and mirror (http://npcdr.idrblab.net/) sites.  

# CONCLUSION  

NP-based drug combinations have attracted broad interests from worldwide scientists, since they have great benefits in treating complex disease by regulating multiple targets/signaling pathways, enhancing the sensitivity of conventional therapy, and reversing drug resistance. Therefore, their valuable data (such as the clinically/experimentally-validated molecular regulations of target and pathway, disease indications, improved therapeutic effects and so on) provided in NPCDR could have great impacts on promoting the identification of NP-based drug, the investigation of disease mechanism, and the development of new computational method/software tool that facilitates the researches in network pharmacology, medical biochemistry, medicinal chemistry & drug design, etc. Those literature-supported and clinically-tested drug combinations collected in NPCDR are reported to be much more credible than the predicted/simulated data, which can thus serve as the gold standards for the construction of novel in-silico tools. Moreover, disease-specific molecular regulation data could help to clarify the elusive biological process underlying each combination, and inspire new therapeutic potential of the combinations in other disease indications.

# ABSTRACT  

In order to advance our understanding of colorectal cancer (CRC) development and progression, biomedical researchers have generated large amounts of OMICS data from CRC patient samples and representative cell lines. However, these data are deposited in various repositories or in supplementary tables. A database which integrates data from heterogeneous resources and enables analysis of the multidimensional data sets, specifically pertaining to CRC is currently lacking. Here, we have developed Colorectal Cancer Atlas (http://www.colonatlas. org), an integrated web-based resource that catalogues the genomic and proteomic annotations identified in CRC tissues and cell lines. The data catalogued to-date include sequence variations as well as quantitative and non-quantitative protein expression data. The database enables the analysis of these data in the context of signaling pathways, protein–protein interactions, Gene Ontology terms, protein domains and post-translational modifications. Currently, Colorectal Cancer Atlas contains data for ${>}13$ 711 CRC tissues, $>165$ CRC cell lines, 62 251 protein identifications, ${\tt>}8.3\$ million MS/MS spectra, ${>}18$ 410 genes with sequence variations (404 278 entries) and 351 pathways with sequence variants. Overall, Colorectal Cancer Atlas has been designed to serve as a central resource to facilitate research in CRC.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common form of cancer and has the fourth highest mortality rate in the world (1). In order to advance our understanding of the initiation and progression of this disease, biomedical researchers have performed global analyses of the genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome and metabolome of CRC patient samples and representative cell lines (2–5). According to The Cancer Genome Atlas Network (3), APC, TP53, KRAS, PIK3CA, FBXW7, SMAD4, TCF7L2 and NRAS are the most frequently mutated genes in CRC. Identification of these mutations and associated pathways has advanced our understanding of CRC, is enabling the sub-classification of this disease and is unveiling potential new avenues for treatment.  

Due to the significant advancements in high-throughput technologies, vast amounts of multidimensional data relevant to the biology of CRC have been generated. To extract meaningful biological insights from these data, researchers previously needed to collate data from a large number of studies. To facilitate this process, a series of databases have been created. For example, cancer gene mutations are currently catalogued in databases including TCGA (3), COS

MIC (6), TumorPortal (7), IntOGen (8), Network of Cancer Genes (9) and TSGene (10). These databases provide valuable information of gene variations for a number of tumor types including CRC, however, they are not specifically designed to integrate sequence variations with proteomic data. NetGestal (11) is a web-based framework that allows for integration of OMIC data from multiple species in the context of biological networks (12) and contains data pertaining to human CRC from TCGA. However, there is currently no user-friendly online resource specifically pertaining to CRC which catalogues genomic and proteomic data from literature, databases and TCGA, integrates the sequence variations with protein domain, post-translational modifications and protein–protein interactions.  

Here, we describe Colorectal Cancer Atlas (http://www. colonatlas.org), an integrated web-based resource which catalogues genomic and proteomic data from CRC tissues and cell lines. Data catalogued include; quantitative and non-quantitative protein expression, sequence variations, cellular signaling pathways, protein–protein interactions, Gene Ontology terms, protein domains and posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Data pertaining to genomic sequence variations and protein expression have been manually curated from the scientific literature and collated from other publicly available databases. Colorectal Cancer Atlas is designed to enable a user to search for a specific mutation in any particular cell line, and search for cell lines with and without specific mutations. Currently, Colorectal Cancer Atlas contains data for ${>}13~711$ primary CRC tissues, ${>}165$ CRC cell lines, 62 251 protein identifications, ${>}8.3$ million MS/MS spectra, $>18410$ genes with sequence variations, 404 278 sequence variation entries, 351 pathways with sequence variants, 88 819 PTMs and 253 700 protein– protein interactions (Table 1).  

# DATABASE ARCHITECTURE AND WEB INTERFACE  

Colorectal Cancer Atlas is a web-based application developed using Zope2 (version 2.8.7–1), a python-based web framework. The back end database is MySQL (version 5.0.95), a well-established open source database. The web pages were developed using Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) in combination with JavaScript for front end functionality, while Python (version 2.4.3), a scripting language was used for database connectivity. JavaScript modules include DataTables (version 1.10.4) for the development of interactive data tables, Data-Driven Documents (D3JS) for the development of interactive protein–protein interaction networks, and Highcharts (version 4.1.6) for the development of interactive heat maps and column charts.  

# GENOMIC DATA SETS  

Colorectal Cancer Atlas catalogues gene sequence variations present in primary CRC tissues and cell lines which were collated by manual curation of the scientific literature. In addition, the database contains genomic variations identified in CRC cell lines sequenced in-house. For cell lines, where available, the gender and age of the patient is provided, along with the specific cell type, doubling time, culture properties and stage of cancer. This information was obtained from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (13), ATCC (http://www.atcc.org), COSMIC database and literature. Sequence variation details including the type of sequence variants, putative mutational effects, nucleotide change and amino acid changes are displayed.  

# PROTEOMIC DATA SETS  

Colorectal Cancer Atlas also catalogues proteomic data collated from multiple resources including the scientific literature (e.g. Zhang et al. (5)), Human Protein Atlas (14), Human Proteinpedia (15) and Human Protein Reference Database (16). Experimental techniques used in generating these data included mass spectrometry, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, confocal microscopy, immunoelectron microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). In addition, publicly available label-free quantitative mass spectrometry data for CRC cell lines and tissues were re-analyzed using an in-house proteomics pipeline in order to provide standardized data. The proteomics pipeline involved conversion of raw mass spectrometry data files into the Mascot Generic File Format (MGF) using MsConvert with peak picking (17). The MGF files were then searched using X! Tandem (Sledgehammer edition version 2013.09.01.1) (18) against a target and decoy Human RefSeq protein database. Peptides were further filtered using $<5\%$ false discovery rate (FDR) as a cut-off, and quantified using the Normalized Spectral Abundance Factor (NSAF) method (19).  

# COLORECTAL CANCER ATLAS PROVIDES AN INTEGRATED VIEW OF MULTIPLE DATA TYPES  

Colorectal Cancer Atlas provides an integrated view of the sequence variations and the proteomic data. Mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic data are depicted as heat maps and column charts in the respective molecular pages (Figure 1), and users are able to filter the data sets based on the FDR. The database also contains protein expression data generated using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, FACS, confocal and immunoelectron microscopy. The database also includes protein data derived from various cellular fractions including the nucleus, cytoplasm, membrane, the secretome (20) and exosomes (21) (from ExoCarta (22)).  

The integration of sequence variants with proteomic data is designed to facilitate the prediction of functional effects of the protein. For each gene, Colorectal Cancer Atlas enables parallel visualization of CRC-associated sequence variants with quantitative protein expression across CRC cell lines and tissues. In addition, PTMs, and protein domains affected by the sequence variation can be visualized (Figure 1), enabling the potential effect of sequence variants on protein function to be easily ascertained. For example, $\upbeta$ -catenin mutations in positions S33, S37, T41 and S45 occur in CRC, all of which are critical for phosphorylation (23). Mutations in these serine/threonine residues allow for the stabilization of $\upbeta$ -catenin and constitutive activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Similarly, Colorectal Cancer Atlas displays sequence variations in known protein domains which can provide valuable insight into the putative effect on protein function. For example, mutations in the armadillo domain (R582) in $\upbeta$ -catenin have been described which have been reported to alter the binding of $\upbeta$ - catenin to TCF4 (24) (Figure 2).

Figure 1. Snapshot of Colorectal Cancer Atlas features. An overview of proteomic and genomic data features for APC gene is displayed. A user can query the database using a gene symbol or a protein name. A gene information page will provide the users with details pertaining to protein domains, posttranslational modifications (PTM), reported mutations in cell lines/tissues, quantitative protein expression, pathway, protein–protein interaction (PPI) and cell line drug sensitivity.  

![](images/053521354b0770d97fc7590e357c12b4e5d61f194e95e69897ab0186d27cf9d9.jpg)

Figure 2. PTMs and domains in $\upbeta$ -catenin are affected due to mutation. Snapshot of $\upbeta$ -catenin molecular page is displayed. The PTMs affected by mutations can be viewed in the tab PTMs. Mutations in $\upbeta$ -catenin at positions important for phosphorylation (S33, S37, T41 and S45) allows for the stabilization of $\upbeta$ -catenin and constitutive activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. The upstream kinases responsible for the phosphorylation is also provided along with the literature reference. Likewise, mutations in the armadillo domain can be viewed by correlating the sequence variants and the domain span regions. For example, mutations in the armadillo domain (p.R582) in $\upbeta$ -catenin have been described which have been reported to alter the binding of $\upbeta$ -catenin to TCF4 (24).  

Colorectal Cancer Atlas also provides a graphical representation of known protein interactions (obtained from BioGrid (25) and Human Protein Resource Database (16)), where each protein is depicted as a node with a specific colour and intensity corresponding to the number of sequence variants in the encoding gene (Figure 1). Furthermore, Colorectal Cancer Atlas integrates biological pathways with gene sequence variants. Biological Pathways were obtained from Reactome (26), KEGG (27), Cell map and HumanCyc. For example, as shown in Figure 1, sequence variants in APC are implicated in dysregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway and actin cytoskeletal remodeling. Finally, Colorectal Cancer Atlas contains data on 5- flurouracil (5-FU) drug sensitivity for CRC cell lines curated from the literature (studies using at least three CRC cell lines (28)). Users can view the sensitivity profile of a cell line of interest relative to other CRC cells.  

# ACCESSING COLORECTAL CANCER ATLAS  

Users can search Colorectal Cancer Atlas through the home, query or browse pages (Supplementary Figure S1). In addition, the website features a navigation menu and a search box at the top of the page. The database can be queried by gene symbol, Entrez Gene ID, protein name, cell line name or pathway. The browse page provides users with the option to access the database by categorized lists of genes, sequence variations, cell lines and techniques. The browse page allows the users to search for sequence variations in genes of interest and displays them in interactive color-coded table format. The gene information page includes gene details, associated GO terms, sequence variations (displayed in an interactive table), domain details, PTMs, a protein data page leading to experimental techniques and quantitative data with an interactive heat map, a column chart for spectral abundance and a list of detected peptides. Other information includes a list of cell lines and tissues that contain sequence variants in a given gene, a list of pathways in which the gene is involved, and an interactive protein–protein interaction network for the protein encoded by the gene. The cell line page provides details of the cell line, an interactive table of gene sequence variants identified in the cell line, an interactive table of dysregulated pathways and 5-FU drug sensitivity profile. Data curated in Colorectal Cancer Atlas are available as tab-delimited files and is free for download to all users. Using the custom database option, the tab delimited data can also be uploaded into FunRich (29), a functional enrichment analysis tool to identify classes of genes/proteins that are overrepresented in a specific category.  

# FUTURE DIRECTIONS  

Colorectal Cancer Atlas will be continuously updated with more studies as they become available and additional features. Studies currently being curated include Wnt signaling activity determined by the TOPFLASH assay, and genomic and proteomic data generated from patient derived xenografts.

# Introduction  

Perturb-Seq, an innovative and powerful technique, combines CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-based screens with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) readouts for high-content phenotypic screens to comprehensively map the transcriptional effects of genetic perturbations genome-wide (1–4 . This technique is highly efficient for large-scale analysis of gene functions and regulatory networks. With he growing prevalence of PerturbSeq technology, its datasets are rapidly accumulating, offering nvaluable opportunities or a rapid understanding of gene functions. However, the large volume and diverse processing methodologies of hese datasets pose significant challenges or researchers in repurposing Perturb-Seq datasets.  

RNA-Seq of a heterogeneous population of cells subjected to knockdown/knockout of a specific gene is a widely used strategy to uncover gene functions and regulatory networks (5 . To distinguish the traditional RNA-Seq strategy based on bulk cell populations from the recently emerged single-cellbased approach known as Perturb-Seq, we will hereafter refer to the former as bulk perturbation RNA-Seq. The bulk perturbation RNA-Seq technology has been frequently used in gene function studies for a long time with a huge amount of bulk perturbation RNA-Seq datasets accumulated. To facilitate researchers in reusing these bulk perturbation RNA-Seq datasets, several bulk perturbation RNA-Seq databases have been constructed, including KnockTF (6 , GPSAdb (7  and Gene Perturbation Atlas (8 .  

The traditional bulk perturbation RNA-Seq is a lowthroughput experiment with high costs and time-consuming procedures. Most bulk perturbation RNA-Seq echniques perturb only one or a few genes, resulting in a limited number of perturbations per experiment. Consequently, existing bulk perturbation RNA-Seq datasets are generated from a large number of experiments by numerous labs across various cell lines. Performing bulk perturbation RNA-Seq in various genetic backgrounds presents a challenge when it comes to directly comparing and integrating the transcriptional phenotype changes induced by different gene perturbations. However, this step is crucial for predicting gene functions and unraveling regulatory networks 1 . The development of PerturbSeq technology has enabled the rapid production of transcriptional phenotypes for tens of thousands of genetic perturbations in a single experiment and within one cell line, all at an acceptable cost (1 2 . These transcriptional phenotypes are generated from cells with highly similar genetic backgrounds, empowering researchers to unveil gene functions through integrated analysis of transcriptional phenotypes resulting from different gene perturbations.  

The field lacks an intuitive and interactive online platform that leverages the growing number of Perturb-Seq datasets for gene functional analysis. Currently, there are three platforms available for Perturb-Seq data analysis. scPerturb (9 , designed for researchers with programming skills, contains a compendium of standardized datasets to aid the development and benchmarking of computational approaches. GeneSetR (10 , a well-designed web server, offers gene set analysis using only hree published Perturb-Seq datasets. The imited number of datasets n GeneSetR restrict ts scope and application. PerturBase (11  is a database for interactively exploring a broad spectrum of Perturb-Seq datasets. However, it falls short in providing comprehensive functionalities for in-depth dataset exploration. This limits its ability to support thorough analyses and generate deeper insights from the data collected. Creating a user-friendly platform that enables in-depth and integrated analysis of Perturb-Seq datasets with other datasets, such as cancer genomic datasets, will enhance the investigation of gene functions and their regulatory role in diseases.  

In his study, we manually collected 66 Perturb-Seq datasets and analyzed them using the uniform algorithm, Mixscape (12 , to generate perturbed transcriptomic phenotypes for 3395 genes. We clustered these genes based on their perturbed transcriptomic phenotypes, resulting in 421 gene clusters. To enhance our analysis of Perturb-Seq datasets, we integrated them with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program dataset (13–15 , the Library of Integrated NetworkBased Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program dataset (16  and bulk perturbation RNA-Seq datasets (17 . These integrations help us to understand gene regulatory roles in cancers, identify novel gene inhibitors and predict gene functions. We also designed an ntuitive and nteractive web nterface, PerturbDB (http://research.gzsys.org.cn/perturbdb , o easily assess o extensive Perturb-Seq datasets and he nsights gained rom hese integrated analyses. The comprehensive eatures of PerturbDB will make t an nvaluable and ndispensable resource or both cancer and gene functional research.  

# Materials and methods  

# Data collection  

To collect Perturb-Seq datasets, we performed a search on the National Center for Biotechnology Information (18) and Single Cell Portal (https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org single_cell using he keyword perturb seq’, single cell crispr’ or ‘scRNA perturb’. After acquiring the accession numbers, expression matrices for all datasets were retrieved from databases, ncluding he Gene Expression Omnibus 19 , Zenodo (https://zenodo.org  and FigShare (https://figshare.com , for further analysis. Additional Perturb-Seq datasets were obtained from published articles and preprints, such as scPerturb (9  and PerturBase (11 , to investigate gene function, gene expression in tumors and combined drug prediction. So far, our dataset comprises transcriptomic perturbation data from human species only. We have actively compiled data through March 2024. In total, 27 papers yielding 66 PerturbSeq datasets were identified (Supplementary Table S1 . Bulk perturbation RNA-Seq datasets were obtained from GPSAdb (7  under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Following filtering, we retained 2999 datasets with single gene perturbations.  

The RNA-Seq transcriptomes and clinical data were retrieved from the TCGA database using the R/Bioconductor package TCGAbiolinks (v2.8.4) (20 . The transcripts per million (TPM) data for gene expression levels in cancer cell lines were sourced from the DepMap portal’s CCLE (Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia) project (https://depmap.org/portal/ data_page/?tab $\c=$ allData . Similarly, the TPM data in normal human tissues were acquired from the GTEx (GenotypeTissue Expression) project https://www.gtexportal.org/home/ downloads/adult-gtex/overview . The implementation of box plots for visualizing these messenger RNA (mRNA) expression data was accomplished through the utilization of Highcharts.js. Differential analysis was conducted using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with disease state (tumor or normal) as the variable to calculate differential expression in the TCGA datasets.

TCGA datasets was performed using the R package survival (v2.43-3).  

# Identification of effectively perturbed cells  

The Mixscape pipeline of he Seurat package v4.2.1) 21 was used for the identification of perturbed genes. All cells containing a single-guide RNA (sgRNA) and control cells were applied similarity analysis and perturbation scoring to identify the perturbed cells [with the function RunMixscape (object $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ eccite, assay $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ‘PRTB’, slot $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ‘scale.data’, labels $\l=$ ‘gene’, nt.class.name $\begin{array}{r}{\mathbf{\Lambda}=\mathbf{\tilde{N}}\mathbf{T}^{\mathbf{\Lambda}}}\end{array}$ , min.de.genes $=5$ , ter.num $=10$ , de.assay $\mathrm{{\Lambda}}=\mathrm{{\cdot}}\mathrm{{RNA}}^{\mathrm{{\prime}}}$ , verbose $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\operatorname{F}\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ]. Only cells identified as a perturbed status (perturbation score ${>}0.5$ ) were included for further analysis.  

# Differential expression and functional enrichment analysis  

Batch differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis was conducted by Seurat ‘FindMarkers’ among the 3395 gene perturbations of Perturb-Seq. All DEG analysis results are available for downloading o meet users’ needs or filtering DEGs at various thresholds. The expression matrices for both perturbed cells and control cells were extracted and subsequently analyzed. Functional enrichment analysis was performed using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (22  within Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (23 , WikiPathways (24  and Hallmark (https://gsea-msigdb.org  databases.

# Identification and annotation of perturbation clusters  

To identify clusters of similar perturbations, CalcPerturbSig (object $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ eccite, assay $\it{\Omega}=\cdot\mathrm{RNA}^{\prime}$ , slot $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ‘data’, gd.class $\l=$ ‘gene’, nt.cell.class $\textstyle=\mathbf{\cdotNT}^{\prime}$ , reduction $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ‘pca’, ndims $=40$ , num.neighbors $=20$ , split.by $\c=$ ‘replicate’, new assay name $\O=$ ‘PRTB’) was used to call a perturbation signature matrix. Then, the perturbation signature matrix was applied principal component analysis (PRTB-PCAs). The HDBSCAN algorithm (metric $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ‘correlation’, min_cluster_size $=~4$ , min_samples $=1$ , cluster_selection_method $\mathrm{\hbar}=\mathrm{\dot{\e}o m}^{\prime}$ ) was performed to identify clusters using PRTB-PCAs in each PerturbSeq dataset. Perturbation cluster annotation was performed using he R package clusterProfiler 25 . The background geometric mean titer files for the hypergeometric distribution test were downloaded from CPDB (26  and CORUM (27 , ncluding KEGG (28 , WikiPathways (24 , Reactome (29  and protein complex information. Only the annotated pathway covering over one-half of the perturbation cluster members was selected for the best complex or pathway annotation.  

# Analysis and visualization of perturbation single-cell ATAC-Seq data  

The perturbation single-cell Assay of Transposase Accessible Chromatin sequencing scATAC-Seq) datasets were downloaded from the Zenodo database (https://zenodo.org/ . Clustering was applied the shared nearest neighbor method using gene score data. Differential significance analysis of gene activity scores ollowing gene perturbation was conducted using the FindMarkers function.  

# Integrating gene and drug perturbations for predictive drug analysis  

The basic information of 2837 chemicals was downloaded from the CLUE database (30 31 . The prediction of gene inhibitors was performed by L1000 query tools. The input data of prediction were generated by the following steps: (i) DEGs derived rom he Perturb-Seq and bulk perturbation RNA-Seq datasets were separated into two categories: upregulated and downregulated; (ii) for both upregulated and downregulated genes, solely the top 150 genes, ranked based on $\log_{2}$ fold change), were employed for the inhibitor prediction exercise; and (iii) DEGs ${<}15$ were not included in prediction. The result files comprise outputs of he similarity between DEGs and transcriptional signatures after drug perturbation.  

# Tools of perturbation-induced GSEA and correlation heatmap visualization (DrawCorrHeatmap)  

PerturbDB produced background datasets for perturbationinduced GSEA (PGSEA) based on specific principles. Each dataset of perturbed genes was divided into two groups: upregulated and downregulated gene sets. Gene sets containing ${<}100$ genes were excluded due to quality control. Consequently, $16~134$ gene sets were retained in PerturbDB. The input data for PGSEA consisted of a list of DEGs [with or without log2 fold change)]. After clicking the ‘Run’ button, PGSEA conducts enrichment analysis with the input data and 16 134 gene sets. The PGSEA output identifies which of the perturbed gene sets in PerturbDB are enriched, assisting users in deducing the effects of the input DEGs.  

DrawCorrHeatmap employs previously computed dimensionally reduced data from perturbation signature matrices as a foundation for calculating similarities using the Pearson correlation coefficient [cor(data, method $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ ‘pearson’)]. Heatmaps are subsequently generated with the pheatmap function’s default settings. The DrawCorrHeatmap tool is designed for ease of use: users simply select their desired dataset and specific genes, click the ‘Plot’ button and instantly receive a heatmap that illustrates the similarity among cell populations following gene perturbation. This functionality allows users to examine the similarity across any combination of genes, thereby aiding in making informed conclusions about their functions.  

# Database construction  

PerturbDB was built based on the Ant Design of Vue (https: //1x.antdv.com/docs/vue/ ntroduce-cn/  framework with Vue 2.0; all results mentioned above were stored in MySQL (version 8.0.13). We have tested it on various web browsers, including Google Chrome (preferred), Internet Explorer and Safari of macOS. The PerturbDB website is freely available online (http://research.gzsys.org.cn/perturbdb  without registration.  

# Cell culture and treatment  

Human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with $1\%$ penicillin– streptomycin and $10\%$ fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies) with $5\%$ $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ at $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Following a $24{\cdot}\mathrm{h}$ period post-seeding, the cells were exposed to a range of retinol concentrations (0, 5, 10, 25 and $50~\ensuremath{\upmu\mathrm{M}}^{\cdot}$ ). After a $24{\cdot}\mathrm{h}$ reatment with retinol, he cells were harvested for subsequent experimental procedures.  

# Western blot  

Cells were lysed with RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (NCM  

Biotech, China) for $30~\mathrm{min}$ at $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and then centrifuged at $13000\times g$ or $30\mathrm{min}$ . Protein supernatants were separated by $10\%$ $\scriptstyle\left(\mathbf{w}/\mathbf{v}\right)$ sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes Millipore Corporation, USA). After blocking with $5\%$ milk for $^{\mathrm{~1~h~}}$ at room temperature, the membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies at $4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ overnight. The following primary antibodies were used: anti-MTOR (2983, Cell Signaling Technology, USA), anti-phosphorylated MTOR (5536, Cell Signaling Technology, USA), anti-p70 S6 Kinase (34475, Cell Signaling Technology, USA), anti-phosphorylated p70 S6 Kinase (9234, Cell Signaling Technology, USA) and anti-GAPDH (60004-1-Ig, Proteintech, China). Unprocessed western blot images are provided in Supplementary Figure S4.  

# Results  

# An overview of Perturb-Seq datasets collected by PerturbDB  

We manually collected a otal of 66 Perturb-Seq datasets, consisting of 3 877 310 single-cell transcriptomes undergoing genetic perturbation and 641 211 single-cell transcriptomes of non-targeting NT) cells. These single-cell datasets were generated from the 22 802 perturbations with the goal of targeting 10 194 genes across 19 different cell lines, including THP1, K562, RPE1, Calu-3, neurons, T cells, MCF10A, MOML-13, HEK293, HepG2, Jurkat and patient-derived melanoma cells. The number of single cells subjected to each perturbation varied, with an average of 170 single cells per perturbation. It is important to note that not all perturbation results in a transcriptional phenotype change at the single-cell level.  

Previous research efforts employed diverse algorithms to detect transcriptional phenotype changes in these datasets, making integrated analysis of these datasets challenging. So far, numerous algorithms have been developed to assess sgRNA perturbation effect (32–35 . Among them, Mixscape (12 , MIMOSCA 2 , MELD 36 and MUSIC 37 can distinguish cells that ‘escape’ perturbation from those significantly perturbed by the same sgRNA. These ‘escaping’ cells, potentially resulting from in-frame insertion and deletion mutations triggered by sgRNA (12 32 37 , may confound the evaluation of perturbation effects. Utilizing cells subjected with control sgRNAs, namely NT cells, we observed that only Mixscape accurately identified all NT cells as non-perturbed (NP) cells (Figure 1A and B). Therefore, we selected Mixscape for analyzing all Perturb-Seq datasets. Following the exclusion of NP cells, we found that the expression changes in sgRNA-targeted genes were significantly higher in perturbed cells compared to all cells (Figure 1C). Moreover, the number of DEGs significantly increased after the removal of NP cells (Figure 1D). These results underscored the importance of excluding NP cells to accurately estimate the perturbation outcomes. Through Mixscape, we found that the genetic perturbation of 3395 genes resulted in significant changes in the transcriptional phenotypes of cells, utilizing the 66 PerturbSeq datasets. These perturbations were referred to as effective perturbations. For each effective perturbation, Mixscape identified on average $74.1\%$ of single cells showing significant alterations in their transcriptional phenotypes (Figure 1E).  

Among the effective perturbations identified in SC00002, $73.8\%$ (1826/2474) had been previously identified, while $26.2\%$ (648/2474) were newly discovered (Figure 1F). The gene targets of effective perturbations exhibited the highest number of RNA binding proteins (RBPs) (Figure 1G). Interestingly, our findings revealed that $51\%$ of gene targets of effective perturbations are essential genes, which are critical for cell survival (38 . Consistently, KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that gene targets of effective perturbation were more likely to be enriched in fundamental cellular processes, such as ribosome biogenesis, DNA replication and RNA degradation (Figure 1H).

# Annotation of gene functions based on transcriptional phenotypes  

Gene function study is a challenging task for researchers. The transcriptome of cells undergoing genetic perturbations, referred to as perturbed transcriptome, offers insight into gene functions. Perturb-Seq s capable of generating perturbed ranscriptomes for numerous genes within the same genetic background. This enables us to cluster genes with similar functions based on their perturbed transcriptome. To assess the similarity between the perturbed transcriptomes of various genes, we first created a perturbation signature matrix for each cell by subtracting the averaged mRNA expression of the top 20 nearest NT cells from that of the target perturbed cells (Figure 2A). Subsequently, we employed PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the perturbation signature space. Then, the perturbed genes were clustered using the top 50 most important PCA dimensions using the HDBSCAN algorithm (39 . Ultimately, we identified 421 perturbation clusters from 30 Perturb-Seq datasets (Figure 2B and

Supplementary Table S2 , with the median cluster size being 11 members (Figure 2B).  

To determine the biological relevance of various perturbation clusters, we annotated them using curated biological relationship datasets, namely CORUM (27 , Reactome (40 , WikiPathways (24  and KEGG (41 . These annotated perturbation clusters encompassed a total of 2680 genes. Of these, 1810 were already known to be associated with the identified complexes or pathways, whereas 870 represented novel members (Figure 2C). This analysis enabled the identification of potential novel roles for 2122 genes. Subsequent complex enrichment analysis showed that genes implicated in these novel roles were significantly enriched in remarkably different complexes compared to other genes within the same annotated perturbation clusters (Figure 2D). We next investigated the recurrence of perturbation clusters across datasets to facilitate the exploration of their potential conserved regulatory functions in various cells. Two perturbation clusters from separate Perturb-Seq datasets that shared over $60\%$ of their members were designated as stable perturbation clusters across these datasets. Our analysis identified 43 stable perturbation clusters n wo datasets, 20 stable perturbation clusters in three datasets, and 5 stable perturbation clusters in four datasets (Figure 2E). With the growth of Perturb-Seq data in PerturbDB, an increased number of stable perturbation clusters will be identified in the future.  

Annotation results showed that many perturbation clusters were derived from well-known complexes or pathways. For example, PC00204 contained critical elements of the $\mathrm{m}^{6}\mathrm{A}$ writer complex, including RBM15, CBLL1, METTL14, METTL3, WTAP and ZC3H13 (Figure 2F). PC00001 consists of key components of the JAK2/STAT1 signaling pathway, including STAT1, JAK2, IFNGR1, IRF1 and IFNGR2 (42  (Supplementary Figure S1 . PC00242 comprises a cluster of proteins, KTI12, CTU2, ELP2, ELP3, ELP4, ELP5, ELP6, RPP21, HBS1L, THG1L and URM1, primarily associated with tRNA biogenesis, except for KTI12 and HBS1L (Figure 2G). Recent nvestigations by Krutyhołowa et al. revealed hat KTI12 is essential for tRNA biogenesis by regulating tRNA modifications (43 , which further highlighted the powerful predictive capabilities of our perturbation clusters for identifying new gene functions. Moreover, our analysis identified numerous perturbation clusters with functions that are currently unknown, providing crucial insights for understanding the regulatory networks essential for cellular homeostasis.  

# Discovering inhibitors through transcriptional phenotype comparison  

The LINCS L1000 project has provided extensive transcriptional phenotype datasets derived from the treatment of nine different cell lines with 2837 chemicals (16 . Given that the transcriptional changes induced by genetic perturbations might mirror those triggered by chemicals targeting the same genes, we posited hat t s plausible o dentify gene nhibitors by comparing transcriptional responses to genetic and chemical perturbations. Utilizing the CLUE algorithm (44 , we calculated similarity score for each comparison. Chemicals achieving a CLUE score of at east 95 n hree or more PerturbSeq/bulk perturbation RNA-Seq datasets were classified as potential gene inhibitors. Our approach led to the identification of 552 chemicals hat may nhibit 1409 genes. After manual literature review of 263 inhibitors targeting nine classical genes involved in various biological processes, we discovered that, on average, $32.6\%$ of hese nhibitors were previously reported to suppress the activities or expression of their target genes (Figure 3A).  

Notably, 22 out of $26\mathrm{MYC}$ inhibitors identified have been documented to inhibit MYC protein or mRNA expression (Figure 3B and Supplementary Table S3 . Additionally, 41 out of 47 mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors identified have been confirmed to inhibit mTOR signaling (Figure 3C and Supplementary Table S3 . We also identified retinol, also known as vitamin A, as an mTOR signaling inhibitor. Experimental verification confirmed ts efficacy n suppressing mTOR signaling Figure 3D). This finding aligns with previous finding that retinoic acid, a metabolic product of retinol, can also regulate mTOR signaling (45 . These results demonstrated the robustness of our integrative methodology in uncovering novel gene inhibitors. As the database of genetic and chemical perturbation-induced transcriptional phenotypes within PerturbDB, we anticipate the identification of an increasing number of inhibitors.  

# Analyzing gene functions utilizing PGSEA  

To facilitate users to analyze gene functions, we have developed the PGSEA tool. This tool allows the identification of genes in PerturbDB that share a similar perturbed transcriptomic phenotype with a gene of interest (Figure 4A). PGSEA employs two distinct methods: the hypergeometric test-based over-representation analysis (ORA) method (46 and the GSEA method (22 . Utilizing the METTL3 knockdown bulk perturbation RNA-Seq dataset (17 , we demonstrated the efficacy of tool. In the GSEA mode, PGSEA identified nine genes sharing similar functions with METTL3, including five known components of the $\mathrm{m}^{6}\mathrm{A}$ writer complex: WTAP, ZC3H13, METTL3, CBLL1 and METTL14 (Figure 4B and C). In contrast, the ORA mode identified 1936 genes, 6 of which belong to the $\mathrm{m}^{6}\mathrm{A}$ writer complex: WTAP, METTL3, CBLL1, RBM15, VIRMA and METTL14 (Figure 4B and C). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that both modes significantly enriched for the ‘RNA $N^{6}$ methyladenosine methyltransferase complex’ erm Figure 4D), suggesting that both modes are effective in predicting gene functions, with the GSEA mode showing higher specificity than the ORA mode. As the Perturb-Seq/bulk perturbation RNA-Seq datasets within PerturbDB continue to expand, the capability of PGSEA to predict gene functions will correspondingly increase.  

# Exploring gene functions and regulatory networks with PerturbDB  

To enable users to effectively utilize the vast amount of Perturb-Seq dataset and functional analysis results generated in this study, we have developed an intuitive web interface called PerturbDB (http://research.gzsys.org.cn/ perturbdb , featuring browsing, searching, visualization and exploration functionalities. With PerturbDB, users can readily access information on downstream gene alterations and pathway enrichment alterations when a gene of interest is subjected to genetic perturbation in various cell lines. Additionally, he platform enables exploration of cancer-associated genes within the ‘Cancer’ module, potential gene inhibitors in the ‘Inhibitor’ module and gene functions using the ‘Perturbation cluster’ module or the PGSEA tool. This valuable resource greatly aids users in deciphering gene functions and their downstream regulatory networks. Finally, PerturbDB incorporated perturbation scATAC-Seq datasets to complement the multi-omics dataset. This addition facilitates the analysis of gene activity and RNA-Seq expression changes, aiding users in identifying potential upstream regulatory relationships.  

Next, we illustrate the utility of PerturbDB with a specific example: within the ‘Cancer’ module, SIRT7 is significantly upregulated in several cancers, including liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma, kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma (Figure 5A and B, and Supplementary Figure S2A–D). Moreover, this upregulation of SIRT7 is remarkably correlated with poorer survival outcomes in these cancers (Supplementary Figure S2E–H). Utilizing the search functionality of PerturbDB, we found that the inhibition of SIRT7 commonly suppresses mTOR signaling in K562, RPE1 and Jurkat cell lines (Figure 5C–G and Supplementary Figure S3A–J). In the ‘Perturbation cluster’ module, SIRT7 was identified as a member of the sPC00010 in three cell lines (Figure 5H). The cluster is annotated as the mTOR signaling pathway’, positioning SIRT7 as a regulator of this pathway (Figure 5  and Supplementary Figure S3 and J). This correlation is supported by the findings of Tsai et al. (47 , further demonstrating the role of SIRT7 in the mTOR pathway. These results suggest that SIRT7 may promote oncogenic potential across various cancers by activating mTOR signaling. The potential regulatory role of SIRT7 in LIHC regulation is worth further experimental investigation. Most of the above results were directly extracted from the PerturbDB web interface, demonstrating its efficiency in elucidating gene functions and regulatory networks.  

# Discussion and conclusions  

In his study, we have developed an nteractive gene unctional analysis platform called PerturbDB (http://research.gzsys.org. cn/perturbdb . This platform enables researchers o readily access downstream regulatory networks, potential unctions and inhibitors of genes they are interested in. To facilitate functional analysis of genes hat are not yet ncluded n PerturbDB, we have also developed a tool called PGSEA. Using this tool, users can infer gene functions by leveraging the large volume of Perturb-Seq datasets included in PerturbDB. Furthermore, all data in PerturbDB can be freely and conveniently downloaded in bulk mode.  

To facilitate users with easy access to all resources in PerturbDB, we developed a user-friendly and intuitive web interface, which includes browsing, searching, visualization and exploration functionalities. Within the web interface, users can easily browse data through five distinct modules: Gene, Dataset, Perturbation cluster, nhibitor and Cancer Moreover users can simply enter a gene symbol or ID in the input box located on the homepage or the top left corner of any page. PerturbDB will then return all relevant information derived from hese five modules or he specified gene on a single page. The user-friendly nature of PerturbDB significantly enhances the effectiveness of users in exploring gene functions and regulatory networks.  

The identification of 143 unannotated perturbation clusters stands as a significant contribution o understanding complex cellular functions and cancer regulation. These perturbation clusters, potentially representing novel protein complexes and signaling pathways, present exciting opportunities for new discoveries despite their current lack of existing annotations. Detailed literature reviews could shed light on the roles of genes within these perturbation clusters. For instance, PC00007 includes genes such as KPNB1, ANKRD17, DLD and CSE1L. KPNB1 and CSE1L are known for their roles in nuclear transportation of proteins (48 , whereas DLD is known as a dehydrogenase critical for energy metabolism (49 . ANKRD17, a widely expressed RBP, is implicated in the Hippo signaling pathway regulation (50 51 . The convergence of these four genes within a functionally similar cluster suggests a potential coordination between protein nuclear transportation, energy metabolism and Hippo pathway. Therefore, a thorough exploration of the unannotated perturbation clusters dentified by us could provide valuable nsights into the mechanisms governing various cellular physiological and pathological processes.  

In response to the rapid accumulation of Perturb-Seq datasets, we are committed to continuously updating PerturbDB, ensuring that it remains a comprehensive and up-todate repository. Anticipated future developments include incorporation of a deep learning tool, designed to streamline the discovery of gene functions. Given the existing uncertainties in the roles of numerous genes in cancer progression, PerturbDB will emerge as an indispensable tool for researchers, aiding significantly in the elucidation of complex gene regulatory networks.

# ABSTRACT  

Marine organisms are expected to be an important source of inspiration for drug discovery after terrestrial plants and microorganisms. Despite the remarkable progress in the field of marine natural products (MNPs) chemistry, there are only a few open access databases dedicated to MNPs research. To meet the growing demand for mining and sharing for MNPs-related data resources, we developed CMNPD, a comprehensive marine natural products database based on manually curated data. CMNPD currently contains more than 31 000 chemical entities with various physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, standardized biological activity data, systematic taxonomy and geographical distribution of source organisms, and detailed literature citations. It is an integrated platform for structure dereplication (assessment of novelty) of (marine) natural products, discovery of lead compounds, data mining of structureactivity relationships and investigation of chemical ecology. Access is available through a user-friendly web interface at https://www.cmnpd.org. We are committed to providing a free data sharing platform for not only professional MNPs researchers but also the broader scientific community to facilitate drug discovery from the ocean.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Natural products and their molecular frameworks play a highly significant role in the drug discovery and development process. Approximately two-thirds of all smallmolecule approved drugs from January 1981 to September 2019 owe their origins to natural products (1). As common and easily accessible resources for humans, terrestrial natural products have long been a traditional source of drug molecules. With the impressive progress of techniques for sample collection (e.g. scuba diving, deep-sea exploration), compound separation (e.g. HPLC) and structure determination (e.g. NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography), marine natural products (MNPs) chemistry have gradually developed and attracted widespread attention (2). Approximately $70\%$ of the Earth’s surface is covered by oceans, which host a wealth of unexplored biological resources. The ocean’s extreme variations in pressure, salinity, temperature, pH, availability of nutrients and light make the secondary metabolites of marine organisms present incredible diversity in both chemical space and biological activities (3). Over 30 000 MNPs have been discovered since the first report of biologically active MNP spongothymidine in 1950 (4). Marine innovative drug discovery has become a hotspot in global drug research and development.  

Access to suitable databases is essential for the comprehensive research of MNPs, such as the discovery of new substances, the synthesis of known compounds or analogues, the analysis of taxonomic and geographic information of source organisms, and the study on bioactivities (5). Yet, there is still a small number of databases dedicated to MNPs research. The commercial databases MarinLit (http: //pubs.rsc.org/marinlit) and Dictionary of Marine Natural Products (http://dmnp.chemnetbase.com) are currently the most exhaustive and complete MNPs databases, but subscription fees may prevent their broader access to academic research. The recently established academic free database MarinChem3D (http://mc3d.qnlm.ac) provides 3D structures of MNPs, but its biological activity data is limited. Some open access databases such as the Seaweed Metabolite Database (SWMD) (6) and the Dragon Exploration System on Marine Sponge Compounds Interactions (DESMSCI) (7) contain only natural products produced by certain types of marine organisms. Other MNPs-related databases are relatively small, and most of them have not been updated for a long time. Generic chemical databases such as Reaxys (https://www.reaxys.com), PubChem (8), ChEMBL (9) and ChemSpider (10) include a certain number of MNPs, but the lack of sufficient annotations makes it difficult to retrieve MNPs from tens of millions of compounds. There is still a need for a free and complete professional MNPs database.  

Here, we present CMNPD, a comprehensive marine natural products database, which includes information on chemical entities with various physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties, standardized biological activity data, systematic taxonomy and geographical distribution of source organisms, and detailed literature citations. CMNPD aims to provide an open access knowledge base for not only professional MNPs researchers but also the broader scientific community to facilitate the research and development of marine drugs.  

# DATA CONTENT  

# Data extraction and curation  

Compound records were mainly extracted from the remarkable annual MNPs reviews published by the late D. John Faulkner in Nat. Prod. Rep. (11), a series continued by the team of John W. Blunt (12), and now Anthony R. Carroll (13). The cited references list was retrieved through Web of Science (https://apps.webofknowledge.com, 2018) and then imported into EndNote (version 9.0.0, Clarivate Analytics Inc. 2018) to obtain full text. After manual curation, more than $20~000$ articles covering the period from the1960s to December 2018 were collected and integrated into a main document library. Most of these articles focused on the reports of new compounds and the relevant biological activities, together with previously reported compounds where there had been a structural revision or a newly established stereochemistry. The chemical structure, compound name, source organism and other information of small molecules were manually extracted and curated from these publications. The structure of MNPs was then used as a query to search in generic chemical databases (e.g. Reaxys, PubChem, ChEMBL), and the scientific literature and patents of hit compounds were integrated into a general document library.  

In order to improve the efficiency of structure extraction, the optical chemical structure recognition tool CLiDE (version 5.12.1, Keymodule Inc. 2017) was used to convert the graphical representations of chemical structures to machine-readable format and transfer them into the chemical editor ChemDraw (version 19.1, PerkinElmer Inc. 2020) for manual inspection and correction. The conformation of the chemical structure was kept consistent with the molecular image in the literature as far as possible to improve recognizability. The chair conformation, Haworth projection and Fischer projection were converted to wedge-dash diagrams to ensure that the stereochemistry could be recognized correctly by the computer software and the 3D shapes could be accurately depicted on the 2D screen. When substituent group abbreviations were expanded, the angle and length of some bonds were adjusted to prevent stacking. The 2D structures were saved in MOL format and then converted into multiple formats (e.g. SMILES, InChI, InChIKey) via Pipeline Pilot (version 18.1, BIOVIA Inc. 2018). Each structure was classified into its corresponding chemical classes using the ClassyFire web server (14). NMR, IR, Raman, UV-Vis, and mass spectra of the structures were presented if available from Wiley SpectraBase (https://spectrabase.com, 2020).  

The 3D conformers were generated using OMEGA (version 3.0.0.1, OpenEye Scientific Software Inc. 2018). When undefined stereocenters existed, each stereoisomer was enumerated and conformers independently generated. A maximum of $100000$ conformers per stereoisomer were allowed, and the lowest-energy conformer of each stereoisomer was retained at last. Since a certain number of complicated MNPs contain many undefined stereocenters and/or rotatable bonds, it makes no sense to compute 3D descriptions for all records. Therefore, according to the criteria of PubChem3D conformer models, CMNPD provides a 3D representation for each compound that satisfies the following conditions: (i) not too large (with no more than 50 heavy atoms), (ii) not too flexible (with no more than 15 rotatable bonds), (iii) has only a single covalent unit (salt, mixture or polymer keep only the largest fragment in the calculation), (iv) consists of only supported elements (H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br and I), (v) contains only atom types recognized by the MMFF94s force field, (vi) has fewer than six undefined atom or bond stereocenters (15). As a result, $79.9\%$ of all records have 3D information.  

# Calculated properties  

To estimate the drug-likeness of each compound, some physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties were calculated using widely accepted algorithms. Physicochemical properties were calculated using RDKit (https://www.rdkit. org, 2020), including molecular weight, molecular mass (i.e. monoisotopic mass), octanol/water partition coefficient ALogP (16), polar surface area (17) and quantitative estimate of drug-likeness QED weighted (18), as well as the number of rotatable bonds, hydrogen bond acceptors, hydrogen bond donors, aromatic rings and heavy atoms. Predictions of pharmacokinetic properties were calculated using Pipeline Pilot ADMET models, including blood brain barrier penetration, human intestinal absorption (19,20), aqueous solubility (21), CYP2D6 binding (22), hepatotoxicity (23) and plasma protein binding (24).  

# Organism resources  

Isolation from the source marine organism is the only way to obtain a promising MNP if it cannot be synthesized. Therefore, it is necessary to record what organisms this compound was isolated from and where these organisms were collected, which is also critical to guarantee the reproducibility of relevant research and maximize the bioprospecting efficiency of MNPs (25). Taxonomic information and sampling location of source organisms were extracted from the articles in the main document library, some of which referred to the authors’ previous papers. All organisms were classified into seven hierarchies (i.e. kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus and species) based on the authoritative taxonomic databases, such as the Catalogue of Life (CoL, version 2019 annual checklist, http://www. catalogueoflife.org, 2020), the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS, http://www.marinespecies.org, 2020), the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS, https:// www.itis.gov, 2020) and the Index Fungorum (http://www. indexfungorum.org, 2020). The taxonomic names of identified species were normalized to accepted scientific names, and the unaccepted names (e.g. original combination, new combination, replacement name, incorrect spelling) were recorded as synonymised names. Some of the (newly) identified species that had not been published with an adequate taxonomic description were not included in the above taxonomic databases. Hence, their names were marked as nomina nuda (naked names) temporarily. Sampling locations were converted to coordinates using Google Maps (https:// www.google.com/maps, 2020). Some articles and their cross references did not describe where the organisms were collected. As a stopgap measure, the address of the author’s affiliation was regarded as the resource location.  

# Biological activity data  

A certain amount of biological activity data based on the initial bioassays of the discoverers was extracted from the main document library, but most of it was brief description of the pharmacological effects, such as ‘cytotoxic’, ‘antibacterial’, ‘antifungal’ and ‘anti-inflammatory’. As one can imagine, substantial bioactivity data is deposited in the generic chemical databases, especially those that store medicinal chemistry data. To capture the greatest quantity of high-quality bioactivity data efficiently, assay and bioactivity information from the ChEMBL database (release 27, 2020), which exchanges data with dozens of datasets such as PubChem BioAssay (26) and BindingDB (27), were incorporated into the CMNPD standardized experimental dataset. This detailed dataset includes target name, target type (e.g. nucleic acid, protein, cell line, tissue, organism), target organism, activity type (e.g. IC50, Ki, ED50, EC50, mortality), activity value, assay type (e.g. binding, functional, ADME, toxicity, physicochemical) and assay description. To provide more authoritative information about the targets, proteins were mapped into the Universal Protein Resource (UniProt) (28), the Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe) (29), the Gene Ontology Annotation (GOA) resource (30), the Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) (31) and the Open Targets Platform (32), while cell lines were mapped into the the Cell Line Ontology (CLO) (33), the Cell Ontology (CL) (34), the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) (35), the Cellosaurus (36) and the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) NIH program (37).  

# Current content  

The content of CMNPD is demonstrated in Figure 1 and the statistical data is summarized in Table 1. In release 1.0, CMNPD contains 31 561 distinct chemical entities of MNPs from over 13 000 sampling organisms. These organisms are distributed in 7 kingdoms, 38 phyla, 93 classes, 289 orders, 682 families, 1480 genera and 3354 species. There are 15 774 active compounds mapped to 2652 targets with 72 343 bioactivities. These targets include 1122 single proteins, $923\ \mathrm{cell}$ lines, 459 organisms and several other types. The document library includes 128 488 scientific literature and patents, of which ${\sim}11~000$ articles describe the discovery of new compounds and structure revisions.  

# DATA ACCESS  

# Web interface  

CMNPD could be accessed at https://www.cmnpd.org with a user-friendly interface. This interface is modelled on the new web interface of ChEMBL (9) to enhance user experience and reduce learning costs. It allows users to browse, search, and explore MNPs-related information in a variety of ways.  

Data browsing. Four main types of entries (compounds, organisms, targets and documents) assigned with unique CMNPD identifiers could be browsed on the full list pages and the dedicated report card pages. The full list pages provide interactive filters that can be applied to show the distribution of the dataset with regard to several specific properties (e.g. molecular weight, target type, organism hierarchy), and to allow users to browse a subset of the original data in a given range for the filter property. The report card pages provide further details about the entries, such as name and classification (for compounds, organisms and targets), literature/patent bibliographic information (for documents), structure, calculated properties and biological activities (for compounds), together with internal links to other report card pages and external links to other resources (e.g. PubChem, UniProt, Catalogue of Life).  

Data query. Quick search is available in the middle of the homepage and on the toolbar in the upper right corner of each page. The free-text search allows users to enter any term of CMNPD identifier, compound name, organism name or target name without specifying a search entity. The search bar will provide suitable suggestions as the term is typed (Figure 2A).  

In addition, a powerful advanced search capability is provided on the query builder page. This allows users to specify any number of query conditions. Available query conditions, which could be combined with the Boolean operator ‘AND’, ‘OR’ or ‘NOT’, include structure (drawing structure, structural classification), compound representations (e.g. compound name, molecular formula), physicochemical properties (e.g. molecular weight, ALogP), ADMET prediction (e.g. blood brain barrier penetration level, human intestinal absorption level), resources (organism name, collection site), bioactivities (e.g. target name, assay type) and bibliography (e.g. authors, DOI). Multiple query conditions could be easily grouped together by just dragging and dropping them. The inner Boolean operations of the grouped conditions will be executed first (Figure 2B). The structure search module, entered with a drawing or a SMILES or InChI string using Marvin JS sketcher (version 19.9.0, ChemAxon Ltd. 2019), allows users to select among exact match, substructure and similarity. Chemical similarity is computed with the Morgan fingerprints and the Tanimoto metric. These fingerprints are generated using RDKit. Some query conditions (e.g. organism name, target name) have both text entry and browse functions, so users have the choice of typing in a search term or selecting from the index.

aChemical entities include different forms of certain compounds (e.g. original structure, revised structure, stereochemically improved structure, controversial structure). bThis is the minimum estimate of the species count, because many unidentified species have been classified into the same category (e.g. Sinularia sp., unidentified species of Family Spongiidae).  

Data visualizations. To help users better understand and explore the data inside CMNPD, several interactive data visualizations have been created with the JavaScript graphing libraries Plotly (https://plotly.com/javascript, 2020) and ECharts (version 4.0, https://echarts.apache.org, 2020). The sunburst charts demonstrate different hierarchies of organism taxonomy and structural classification. Any section can be expanded by clicking and the corresponding entries can be retrieved using the button below the chart (Figure 3A). The dot distribution map shows the organism collection or storage sites of each compound. Clicking the dot on the map can retrieve the compounds discovered in the corresponding area. The distribution map is also available on each organism report card page and compound report card page (Figure 3B).

Figure 2. Data query in the web interface. (A) Free-text quick search. Users can retrieve a list of entities matching a selected keyword (e.g. all organisms matching ‘spongia’) or go directly to a report card page for a selected entry (e.g. organism Demospongiae: CMNPD330032). (B) Advanced search. Query conditions are combined with Boolean operators. The inner Boolean operation of the grouped conditions is executed first, and then the outer Boolean operations are performed in order from top to bottom. (C) Search result of the keyword ‘spongia’. Users can further select the entries through the interactive filters on the left.  

To intuitively illustrate the relationship between organisms, compounds and targets, a systematic analysis function is provided using vis-network (version 7.7.0, https:// visjs.org, 2020), which allows users to build network visualization by selecting a master node from these entries. Clicking on the node can retrieve the detailed information of the corresponding entry (Figure 3C).  

# Downloads  

Some users would like to download the database for data mining or virtual screening besides querying it via the web interface. Bulk downloads of several complete datasets are available at https://docs.cmnpd.org/downloads. In addition, users can customize the compound download list through the advanced search and manual selection.  

# DATA DEPOSITION  

To improve the quantity and quality of data, CMNPD provides a deposit system, which allows users to submit new compounds, new data of existing compounds and corrections to existing data. Only the published data is acceptable, and references must be attached at the time of submission. Scholars engaged in MNPs research are welcome to submit new compounds to CMNPD once the paper is accepted by the journal. When depositing a new chemical entity, the MOL format is preferable to SMILES or InChI strings, which ensures that the conformational structure expression is consistent with that in the publication.  

# SUMMARY  

Marine organisms are regarded as an important source of inspiration for drug discovery after terrestrial plants and microorganisms. Half of the discovered MNPs have various biological activities. Several marine-derived drugs (e.g. Ziconotide, Trabectedin, Eribulin) have been approved by FDA, and more candidates are in clinical trials (40). The fact that there are few approved marine-derived drugs is certainly not due to the limited chemical diversity of MNPs. Actually, material supply issues remain the major obstacle to marine drug discovery. In the absence of universality for total synthesis and mariculture, information sharing is particularly important for the development of MNPs research.  

To make the best of the full potential offered by the chemical diversity of the secondary metabolites from marine organisms for drug discovery, we present CMNPD as an open access knowledge base with comprehensive data, intuitive web interface and advanced retrieval system for the broad scientific community. CMNPD supplies accurate chemical structures and various calculated physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties for computer-aided drug design as well as detailed taxonomic and geographic information of source organisms for the study of chemical ecology. The standardized experimental dataset integrates the ChEMBL database to provide high-quality biological activity data. In future, we expect CMNPD to grow continuously with extensive data deposition and resource integration, becoming an even more comprehensive MNPs repository that could lead the wave of marine drug development.

# ABSTRACT  

In vitro cancer cell cultures are facile experimental models used widely for research and drug development. Many cancer cell lines are available and efforts are ongoing to derive new models representing the histopathological and molecular diversity of tumours. Cell models have been generated by multiple laboratories over decades and consequently their annotation is incomplete and inconsistent. Furthermore, the relationships between many patient-matched and derivative cell lines have been lost, and accessing information and datasets is time-consuming and difficult. Here, we describe the Cell Model Passports database; cellmodelpassports. sanger.ac.uk, which provides details of cell model relationships, patient and clinical information, as well as access to associated genetic and functional datasets. The Passports database currently contains curated details and standardized annotation for $\bf{>}1200$ cell models, including cancer organoid cultures. The Passports will be updated with newly derived cell models and datasets as they are generated. Users can navigate the database via tissue, cancertype, genetic feature and data availability to select a model most suitable for specific applications. A flexible REST-API provides programmatic data access and exploration. The Cell Model Passports are a valuable tool enabling access to high-dimensional genomic and phenotypic cancer cell model datasets empowering diverse research applications.  

# INTRODUCTION  

The currently available set of ${\sim}1000$ human cancer cell lines are widely used in research and drug development due to their ease of use, broad utility and low reagent costs. Cancer cell lines have made important contributions to the development of anti-cancer drugs, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor gefitinib for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (1), inhibitors of the protein kinase BRAF in melanoma (2) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors for ALK-fusion positive lung cancer (3). They have also been instrumental in research beyond cancer including the development of the polio vaccine (4). Their experimental tractability has led to their use in large-scale genetic and pharmacological screens to identify new drug targets and guide biomarker development including the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) project based at the Sanger Institute, the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE), the National Cancer Institute-60 (NCI-60) cancer cell line screen and the Cancer Therapeutic Response Portal (CTRP) (5–8).  

Due to their extensive use over decades, there are several challenges when working with and selecting cancer cell models. Many models have inadvertently been crosscontaminated (9–11) or are associated with numerous synonymous identifiers (11, 12). In addition, key patient and clinical information has been lost including relationships between cell lines originally derived from the same patient or sample (13). The lack of a consistent controlled vocabulary to describe cell line metadata and the large number of synonymous identifiers makes data integration and crossreferencing of datasets burdensome (14, 15). The length of time in culture, culture conditions and exogenous selective pressures on a cell line (e.g. PDX engraftment) can lead to genetic drift (16, 17). Therefore, a clear understanding of the characteristics and source of the model used to generate a given dataset is important for reproducibility of results. Although many cell lines have been genetically and functionally characterized, it is often difficult to determine what information is available for a particular cell line and how to access these data. Furthermore, these datasets are often inaccessible to non-computational, wet-lab scientists. As a result of these issues, the informed selection of cancer models based on patient, clinical and molecular features, and the availability of associated datasets is currently time consuming and difficult.  

To address these problems, we have created Cell Model Passports; cellmodelpassports.sanger.ac.uk. The Cell Model Passports is a central portal providing manual or programmatic access to a cancer cell model database containing curated patient, sample and model relationship information as well as genomic and functional datasets. Here, we describe the Passports and available datasets, and provide information on how they can be accessed through a user-friendly web application and programmatically through a REST Application Programming Interface (API).  

As outlined in Figure 1, the Passport’s relationship hierarchy captures the key points in the model derivation process, namely the patient, samples obtained and models established. This approach provides users with a clear structure of cell model relationships and the potential to integrate data at any level of the relationship hierarchy. In the database, the hierarchy has been modelled as one-to-many relationships, where a patient can have multiple samples, which can each have multiple models. Any hierarchy between models (e.g. subclones, derived models and drug resistant clones) has been modelled as an adjacency list storing each model’s parent identifier where appropriate.  

# MODEL ANNOTATIONS  

More than 1200 established cancer cell lines and newly derived organoid models comprise the foundational model set of the Passports, including all those utilized in the Sanger’s GDSC project (5, 18) as well as cell models generated as part of the Human Cancer Models Initiative. The majority of cell models are available to the research community through public repositories. The annotation conducted provides users with key model characteristics and relationships, a summary of relevant genetic features as well as the ability to integrate datasets from multiple resources. Over 30 attributes may be annotated to a model including primary name, synonyms, tissue of origin, disease details including treatment as well as patient information, such as gender, ethnicity and age (Supplementary Table S1).  

Cell model names are often the only means to integrate and compare datasets but they are also one of the most variable properties. The Passport model name is accompanied by synonyms and most importantly unique identifiers utilized by established resources such as Research Resource Identifiers (RRID) (19), the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) (20) and CCLE (6) to aid data integration and alignment.  

Model lineage, a requirement for tissue-specific analyses, is provided through three progressively granular fields: ‘Tissue’ ${\mathrm{\Delta}n}=29$ categories), ‘Cancer Type’ $(n=44)$ ) and ‘Cancer Type Detail’ $n=194.$ ). The cancer type descriptors use the NCI-Thesaurus terms, benefitting from established definitions that assist integration with other ontologies. Models in the Passports have been derived from primary, metastatic, pre-cancerous and normal samples as indicated by ‘Tissue Status’, the anatomical site from which the sample was obtained ‘Sample Site’ is also provided.  

Annotation of genomic features has been provided for each model via the exploitation of the available genomic datasets. Features include microsatellite stability status, ploidy, mutational burden and the mutation status of 455 cancer driver genes (18). Furthermore, top drug sensitivities for cell models are also provided as determined by the drug profiling of ${\sim}250$ compounds as part of the GDSC project (18).  

# Model relationships  

The annotation of relationships that exist between models is an important feature of the Passports, designed to address the issues faced by researchers of related, mis-identified or cross-contaminated models.  

# Datasets  

Over 3500 genetic datasets and more than 1000 drug sensitivity datasets are available. Most cell models $(85\%)$ have associated somatic nucleotide variant, gene expression, copy number variation or methylation datasets (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table S2). Currently, all datasets have been generated by the Sanger Institute and consequently there is a direct relationship between the cell model described and the datasets provided, mitigating the risk of misidentification and genetic drift. Genomic datasets for each model are provided as raw data, typically a link to the appropriate repository, and as processed files or data tables that can be directly downloaded from the website or queried using the available API. The processed files and a description of cancer driver gene status for each model facilitates access for non-informaticians. Furthermore, cell model drug sensitivity data have been provided where available, and the Passport provides links to the associated GDSC webpage for a given model.  

Each processed genomic dataset is stored in a dedicated database table. Tables hold the data in long form, with each row a gene along with its associated values. In the case of mutations, there can be multiple rows for any given gene due to the presence of multiple mutations in a gene of a given model. The processed datasets provide gene-level information, rather than segment or transcript, allowing direct integration and cross-comparisons with other datasets within the Passports. All genes have been assigned an internal ID, allowing mapping to current and previous HGNC gene symbols, Ensembl Gene IDs (v91) and other external gene identifiers. All genes with an HGNC-approved symbol as of April 2018 are currently included in the Passports, including those without a protein product. Any dataset values that were mapped to genes without an official gene symbol have been discarded from processing, but continue to be available in raw data downloads.  

# DATABASE CONSTRUCTION  

# Curation  

Model annotation was compiled from information provided by commercial cell banks (ATCC, DSMZ, JCRB and ECACC) academic collaborators, databases (Cellosaurus (19) and CCLE (6)) along with publications (15, 21–33) (Supplementary Table S3). A constrained vocabulary was developed to consolidate model descriptors. The patient, sample, model hierarchy was established by combining information gained during model annotation along with resources cataloging mis-identified and synonymous models (33, 34). In addition STR/fingerprinting profiles gathered internally and during curation were analysed to confirm model-patient associations (33, 34). By default, models sharing common ancestry are assigned to separate samples of a single patient, unless evidence is available indicating otherwise. This relatively conservative approach ensures data can be accurately attributed to the specific cell model, thereby improving reproducibility between users of the same or related models.

Figure 2. An overview of the availability of various genomic and functional datasets. Currently, mutation, copy number variation (CNV), methylation, gene expression and drug sensitivity datasets are available. To emphasize the lack of sparsity, a subset of 956 models has been highlighted for which all five datasets are available.  

# Technologies  

The Cell Model Passports resource was constructed using a PostgreSQL (v9.6) database and is hosted at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. The REST API is developed in Python 3.6 using the Flask framework (v0.12) and SQLAlchemy (v1.2). The web interface utilizes the React framework (v16.4), with Bootstrap (v4.0) providing user interface elements and responsive adaptation to screen size.  

# ACCESSING AND SEARCHING FOR MODEL INFORMATION AND DATASETS  

# Web-based access  

The website enables users to search and/or filter for cell models via a variety of features as well as providing access to datasets. The search and filter functions allow users to not only conduct direct queries for an individual model or cancer, but also combine filters to identify a cohort of cell models with a particular set of characteristics. For example, one can filter for non-small-cell lung cancer cell models derived from a metastatic lesion with a mutation in KRAS and subsequently access the expression and drug sensitivity data sets for this cohort of models. It is also possible to filter models based on the availability of specific datasets, for example, the subset of breast cancer models with both mutation and gene expression data.  

Multiple information panels are displayed on the Model Page (Figure 3). ‘Model Information’ is provided for all models while additional panels are dependent upon availability of relevant information. Cancer driver mutation status for a model is provided as a word cloud, where text size represents the prevalence of mutations in a gene for all cell models of the same tissue type, and the colour differentiates between tumour suppressors and oncogenes. Drug sensitivity data obtained from the GDSC project are also reported showing the compounds to which a model is most sensitive. Dataset highlights such as these assist users to make informed decisions regarding cell models and facilitates further data integration and analysis. Full documentation can be found in the website user guide available on the website.  

cellmodelpassports.sanger.ac.uk on specific endpoints. Requests should follow the JSONAPI v1.0 standard (jsonapi.org), though a few additions are available to accommodate search and aggregations. Responses strictly follow the JSONAPI v1.0 standards. Endpoints are available for lists of patients, samples, models, identifiers, files, all processed datasets and cancer driver mutations. Requests can have modifiers that allow users to select, filter and sort the results and control pagination. To facilitate access to available resources, all relationships between resources are fully annotated within the API, including API URLs to related resources. Full documentation and examples can be found in the API user guide available on the Passports website.  

# API  

Programmatic access to the Cell Model Passports database is available through a flexible API. The API can be accessed through HTTPS GET requests to https://api.  

# Data files  

Data files are hosted on a robust S3 object store platform or in third party repositories; the Cell Model Passport database contains links to these files together with associated metadata. There are two categories of files, each with their own database table: generic files and model files. Model files are tied to a specific model and are currently used for model-specific datasets, images, documentation or authentication details. Generic files hold data for multiple models or are files not otherwise associated with an individual model.  

# DISCUSSION  

The Cell Model Passport is a centralized cell model hub, providing a platform for researchers to investigate key patient and sample information, manually and programmatically access multiple genetic and functional datasets, and facilitate integration of data from different sources through mapping of unique identifiers.  

Given the widespread usage of cancer cell models several resources exist that hold cell model information such as Cellosaurus (19), PharmacoDB (35), cBioPortal (36) and COSMIC (20). Nonetheless, the Cell Model Passports integrate and build upon these to provide new functionality. First, Cellosaurus and cBioPortal do not provide cell model functional information, while PharmacoDB does not contain genomic annotation of the cell models and has limited sample/model information. Second, cBioPortal and COSMIC are primarily focused on patient tumour genomic data. Third, neither cBioPortal, PharmacoDB nor COSMIC curate samples to map unique identifiers or link samples and models from the same patient, which can be important for identifying mis-identified or cross-contaminated samples. To the best of our knowledge, there are no other web-resources providing a centralized portal with cell model relationship information, access to associated datasets and annotation of cancer gene status and drug sensitivity. Thus, the Cell Model Passport database builds upon and extends the functionality of existing resources.  

In addition to the existing deep characterization, cell lines are continually being used in new initiatives such as the Dependency Map at Sanger (depmap.sanger.ac.uk), generating additional datasets, such as whole-genome CRISPRknockout screens, calling of fusion transcripts and additional drug response data. The Cell Model Passports will incorporate these newly generated datasets to facilitate their utilization for scientific research. The Passports currently focus on high quality and consistent datasets generated by the Wellcome Sanger Institute, but in the future will expand to include cell models and datasets generated by external resources while maintaining an emphasis on quality and curation. Furthermore, with recent technological advancements (e.g. organoid models and conditionally reprogrammed cell lines), a new generation of cancer cell models is being derived to allow full representation of the histopathological and molecular diversity of tumours (37–42). The Sanger Institute is a member of the Human Cancer Model Initiative, which aims to make a resource of highly annotated cancer models, and the Cell Model Passports will ensure that model annotation, relationships and open access to experimental data is preserved from the outset.

Figure 3. An example of a Passport Model Page. The model features and datasets are provided by the multiple information panels. Links are provided to NCI-Thesaurus definitions as well as raw and processed genomic and drug sensitivity data.  

In summary, the Cell Model Passports provide a resource to reduce the mis-identification of cell models, facilitate data integration and subsequently improve experimental reproducibility in cancer research and related fields. We anticipate that the Passports will be widely used to inform the selection of cancer models and to provide user-friendly access to cell model relationship information as well as clinical, genomic and functional datasets.

# ABSTRACT  

The current state of the COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis. To fight the novel coronavirus, one of the best-known ways is to block enzymes essential for virus replication. Currently, we know that the SARS-CoV-2 virus encodes about 29 proteins such as spike protein, 3C-like protease (3CLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), Papainlike protease (PLpro), and nucleocapsid (N) protein. SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for viral entry and transmembrane serine protease family member II (TMPRSS2) for spike protein priming. Thus in order to speed up the discovery of potential drugs, we develop DockCoV2, a drug database for SARS-CoV-2. DockCoV2 focuses on predicting the binding affinity of FDA-approved and Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) drugs with the seven proteins mentioned above. This database contains a total of 3,109 drugs. DockCoV2 is easy to use and search against, is well cross-linked to external databases, and provides the state-of-the-art prediction results in one site. Users can download their drug-protein docking data of interest and examine additional drug-related information on DockCoV2. Furthermore, DockCoV2 provides experimental information to help users understand which drugs have already been reported to be effective against MERS or SARS-CoV. DockCoV2 is available at https: //covirus.cc/drugs/.  

# INTRODUCTION  

From December 2019 to June 2020, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 10 million people, and caused ${>}500$ thousand deaths worldwide (1). As a result, the last few months has seen a rapid expansion of COVID-19 research (2–7) including the discovery of potential inhibitors and drugs against SARS-CoV-2 (8–12).  

The SARS-CoV-2 genome contains ${\sim}30000$ nucleotides that encode about 29 proteins such as spike protein, 3Clike protease (3CLpro, also called main protease, Mpro), Papain-like protease (PLpro), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, also named nsp12), and nucleocapsid $(\Nu)$ protein (9,13–15). These five proteins are all known to play important roles in the viral replication process in some way. For example, the surface spike glycoprotein is known to be critical for virus entry through binding to the major antigens of host receptors such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (16,17). The 3CLpro is a key enzyme which digests pp1a and pp1ab, two proteins that yield functional viral proteins in the virus’ life cycle (10,18). Blocking the activity of this enzyme would therefore suppress viral replication, making it an efficient therapeutic strategy. Likewise, PLpro is responsible for the cleavage of the viral polypeptide (19), and RdRp catalyzes viral RNA synthesis and plays an important role in the replication and transcription machinery of SARS-CoV-2 (20). Remdesivir, the potent inhibitor against SARS-CoV-2, is effective because of how it targeted the RdRp protein (20,21). N protein is an RNAbinding protein necessary for viral RNA transcription and replication (15). In addition to the viral proteins, SARSCoV-2 uses human ACE2 for viral entry and human transmembrane serine protease family member II (TMPRSS2) for spike protein priming (16). We therefore hypothesize that these five SARS-CoV-2 proteins, spike, 3CLpro, PLpro, RdRp, N protein, and two host proteins, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, can be potential druggable targets.  

Previously, researchers have targeted these viral proteins for drug discovery by using structure-assisted design, virtual and high-throughput screening (8,11). Similarly, these approaches can also be used for SARS-CoV-2 research (22).  

For example, Jin et al. used a computer-aided drug design and virtual screening to identify the mechanism-based inhibitor (N3) and the antineoplastic drug carmofur targeting Mpro (10,11). They further determined the crystal structures of the N3- and carmofur-Mpro complexes and confirmed the antiviral activities of N3 and carmofur using the plaque-reduction assays (10,11).  

Drug repositioning is the process of finding new uses for existing approved drugs, and is believed to offer great benefits over de novo drug discovery, as well as enable rapid clinical trials and regulatory review for COVID-19 therapy (23). Here we develop the database, DockCoV2, by performing molecular docking analyses of seven proteins including spike, 3CLpro, PLpro, RdRp, N protein, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 with 2285 FDAapproved and 1478 NHI drugs. DockCoV2 also provides appropriate experimental information with literature support. Several databases focus on delivering repurposing drugs against SARS-CoV-2. For example, Excelra’s COVID-19 Drug Repurposing Database includes 128 small molecules and biologics (https://www.excelra. com/covid-19-drug-repurposing-database/) and the OpenData collected the actionable data and validated methodologies (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.04.135046). Additionally, Covid19 DB lists the curated data of clinical trials in Covid-19/2019-nCoV (http://www.redo-project.org/ covid19db/). To our knowledge, no database provides a more up-to-date and comprehensive resource with drugtarget docking results for repurposed drugs against SARSCoV-2.  

# DATA SOURCES  

For drug repositioning, we selected FDA and Taiwan NHI (National Health Insurance Administration) as our list of approved drugs. FDA-approved drugs were retrieved from the ZINC15 database (24), and Taiwan NHI-approved drugs were downloaded from the website of NHI. Drug names were extracted from the top five ingredients of each product, and drug structures were obtained from the PubChem Compound database (25). Due to the limitation of the ligand preparation pipeline, we dropped some compounds with ions which could not be converted properly by the gen3d operation of OpenBabel (version 3.0.0) (26). Note that we also added some additional FDA-approved drugs which are not in the ZINC15 database. In total, 2285 FDAapproved drugs and 1478 Taiwan NHI-approved drugs were recruited as our candidates for virtual screening.  

Seven target proteins were selected because of their involvement in viral entry and replication. The protein structures, including 3CLpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) (10), PLpro (PDB ID: 6WX4) (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.29. 068890), RdRp (PDB ID: 7BV2) (21), spike receptorbinding domain (RBD) (PDB ID: 6M0J) (27), N protein (PDB ID: 6M3M) (15) and ACE2 (PDB ID: 1R42) (28) were retrieved from Protein Data Bank. To ensure the availability of the binding sites of the proteins, we removed the compounds added for protein structure determination such as ligands, cofactors, and ions. For the spike protein, only the RBD was used for molecular docking and for 7BV2, only the nsp12 was used out of the nsp7–nsp8–nsp12 complex. The structure of human TMPRSS2 is currently not available in Protein Data Bank, so we used homology modeling on the sequence of TMPRSS2 from Uniprot (ID: O15393) (29) to build an approximate structure based on the template of the human serine protease hepsin (PDB ID: 5CE1) using SWISS-MODEL (30).  

# DATABASE CONTENT  

DockCov2 aims to speed up the process of finding potential drugs by providing a computational representation of molecular docking with the most commonly-used drug databases (31–35). Through our website, researchers can query the docking scores of candidate drugs with essential drug-related information from the database to identify which drugs could be potential drugs. We designed a virtual screening pipeline, and docked 2285 FDA approved drugs and 1478 Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) approved drugs with the seven main proteins of the SARSCoV-2 infection mechanism (36–38). All of our docking results are saved in the formats of Protein Data Bank, Partial Charge (Q) and Atom Type (T) (PDBQT), and can be viewed either directly on the website through NGLView (39) or downloaded for further docked structure refinement.  

The overview of the database is shown in Figure 1. In addition to the molecular docking score, the joint panel section has three tabs: docking structure, ligand information and experimental data. The docking structure panel visualizes the docking PDBQT from the self-calculated database, which also contains druglikeness information and compound similarity. The ligand information panel contains (a) structural information from PubChem Compound database (25); (b) drug information from DrugBank (33); (c) pathway information from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (40); (d) clinical-related information from Repurposing Hub (34); and (e) other chemical information. In the experimental data panel, we collected experimental and literary evidence from ChEMBL (35), a study of gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) from Zhou et al. (41) and COVID-19 Crowd Generated Gene and Drug Set Library (https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/covid19).  

# DATA PROCESSING AND INTEGRATION  

# Identifier conversion  

We chose PubChem compound identifiers (CIDs) as the key identifier in DockCoV2 because it is unique and widely used and can be easily linked to other external databases. For drugs retrieved from NHI, drug names were translated into CIDs using whole source mappings provided by UniChem (31) and PubChem Identifier Exchange Service (https:// pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/idexchange/). Specifically, multiple CIDs may be returned by PubChem Identifier Exchange Service for each drug name. We canonically chose the first returned record in order to be consistent with the result by manual search via the graphical interface of PubChem. Once we have the PubChem CIDs of our compound library, simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) (42), international chemical identifier (InChI), hashed values of international chemical identifiers (InChIKey), and synonyms were fetched through the PubChem PUG API (43).  

![](images/8cea7335d7cb8c8059491d00a8c3f017b890757976e4b9e7fe330fb8e5f13e2b.jpg)  
Figure 1. The overview of the database content. In addition to the docking scores, DockCoV2 designed a joint panel section to provide the followin related information: docking structure, ligand information and experimental data.  

# Ligand information  

For drug development, Lipinski’s rule of five (44), Ghose filter (45), Veber filter (46), rapid elimination of swill (REOS) filter (47) are several available indicators to evaluate the druglikeness. Therefore, components of these rules were calculated by RDKit (http://www.rdkit.org). Moreover, fragment screening is able to find a sensible starting point for the evolution of a new molecule in modern drug discovery. Previously, a large crystallographic fragment screen (48) was performed against 3CLpro by the Diamond Light Source group. Seventy-eight hits were released to the public in March 2020. In DockCoV2, we performed the substructure matching of these fragments toward the drug library we used here. To let the user easily fetch structurally similar compounds, similarity search (49) strategies were also adopted. Similarity search within the DockCoV2 and toward whole PubChem compound databases are both supported. To generate similarity values between any two compounds in DockCoV2, a 512-bit fingerprint of each compound is calculated using the Morgan algorithm (50). Each bit represents the presence or absence of a particular structural feature. From here, similarity values between any compound pairs are represented by the Dice coefficient. In the current version of DockCoV2, the rule of five, substructure matching, and the calculation of similarity values were all done by using the RDKit 2020.03.2 release.  

Pathway information can serve as the basis of hypothesis in drug discovery. Therefore, two databases of KEGG (namely, KEGG Drug and KEGG Compound) were integrated into DockCoV2. PubChem CIDs were converted into DrugBank IDs first, then further converted into KEGG Drug IDs and KEGG Compound IDs. Alternatively, PubChem CIDs were directly converted to KEGG Drug IDs and KEGG Compound IDs by PubChem Identifier Exchange Service. Clinically related information including approval information, clinical phase, mechanism of action (MoA), target, disease area, and indication were also retrieved from the metadata file from the Drug Repurposing Hub.  

# Experimental data  

To provide useful validation information for drug repurposing and development, chemical information was aggregated either from external databases or directly calculated from structures. Three biological assays CHEMBL4303805, CHEMBL4303810, CHEMBL4303819 were fetched from ChEMBL (35). All of these three assays are functional assays. For CHEMBL4303805, Antiviral activities were determined as inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 induced cytotoxicity of Caco-2 cells at $10~\mathrm{uM}$ after $48\mathrm{~h~}$ by high content imaging. Ratios of inhibition of each compound were reported. For CHEMBL4303810, Antiviral activities against SARS-CoV2 (USA-WA1/2020 strain) were measured by imaging in HRCE cells at MOI 0.4 after $96\mathrm{h}$ . Hit scores were reported from 0 to 1 for on-disease versus off-disease activity: scores ${>}0.6$ are considered hits. For CHEMBL4303819, Inhibition of cell viability relative to arbidol control (inhibition index) was measured by fluorescence $(\mathrm{OD}590\mathrm{nm}$ ) in Vero E6 cells, which were infected with SARS-CoV-2 (strain BavPat1) at MOI 0.002 after $^{72\mathrm{~h~}}$ . Inhibition index with a value over 1 indicates higher activity. ChEMBL IDs were translated into CIDs using whole source mappings provided by UniChem (31) and PubChem Identifier Exchange Service as well.  

Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is a method that determines whether an a priori defined set of genes show statistically significant expression differences between two biological states (51). Here, three NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data, GSE1739, GSE33267 and GSE122876 were used to identify sets of differentially expressed genes post SARS or MERS infection. Gene expression profiles of drug treatment were retrieved from the Connectivity Map (CMAP) database. The GSEA enrichment scores indicate the potential effectiveness of candidate drugs to reverse the gene expression signature of HCoV infection. For detailed information, please see Zhou et al. (41). Literature was also fetched from COVID 19 Coward Generated Gene and Drug Set Library to assist the user to validate the hypothesis of an interaction between a drug and its target. Only compounds that were reported in experiments were collected.  

# VIRTUAL SCREENING  

There are many softwares that exist for virtual screening such as VSDK (52), AUDocker (53), DockoMatic (54), PyRx (55), etc. However, the efficiency of these tools may not be applicable on large drug banks such as the complete FDA-approved drug list. Therefore, we used AutoDock Vina (version 1.1.2) (56) as the core docking utility to reconstruct our virtual screening pipeline, and ran it on a Kubernetes server with parallel computing (Figure 2). Kubernetes is an engine server, which can automatically deploy, scale and manage the containerized tasks to clusters. In practice, we uploaded the FDA-approved and Taiwan NHIapproved drug lists to Redis data storage, and generated 128 Kuberenetes pods in parallel. Each pod continuously takes up a new docking task of a drug until the Redis drug list is completed. Based on our implementation, the virtual screening for our drug list only costs 3 days per protein.  

![](images/3cc51b5e2098522229b2be1022a636f49182792c53eb24e9ed541820688edc70.jpg)  
Figure 2. The virtual screening pipeline. We used AutoDock Vina as the core docking utility to reconstruct the virtual screening pipeline. In addition, the Kubernetes server and Redis data store were adopted for parallel computing. After finishing docking, the top 20 docking poses were taken to build a protein heatmap for visualization.  

To simulate binding affinity between protein and ligands, each of the drug’s 3D structure was obtained from the PubChem database in structure-data file (SDF) format. The gen3d operation of OpenBabel (version 3.0.0) (26) was used for energy minimization. This operation iterated 500 cycles of performing the geometry optimization with the MMFF94 force field and conducting the weighted rotor conformational search, in order to generate a likely global minimum energy conformer in MOL2 file format. Since AutoDock Vina only takes the PDBQT format as input, we used AutoDockTool 1.5.7 (http://autodock.scripps.edu/ resources/adt) to convert the file format from MOL2 to PDBQT with default parameter settings excluding a parameter -A, which would add hydrogens to structure only if there are none already. After that, we applied rigid-body docking on these converted files using AutoDock Vina. In order to consider all of the potential docking poses, the entire protein is taken as the search space for blind search. We noted that the number of runs of the docking simulation should be adjusted accordingly by considering the variety of protein sizes. In AutoDock Vina, the number of runs is set by the exhaustiveness parameter, and the default setting of exhaustiveness is set at eight for a search space below $30\times30\times30\mathring{\mathrm{A}}$ (56). We proportionally scaled the exhaustiveness depending on the size of the protein by a factor of 2. For example, if the size of a protein is $60\times60\times60\mathrm{~\AA~}$ , the exhaustiveness would be $8\times(60/30)\times(60/30)\times(60$ $/30)\times2=128$ . AutoDock Vina reported multiple docking scores for each run, and the top score was selected as the final result shown on the website. The distribution of the final scores of each protein is shown in Figure 3. By comparing the scores between systems (different proteins), there is no bias of docking scores toward any protein we are interested in. By examining the intra-system scores, we observed that for each protein if there is a group or few ligands that are with particularly good docking scores.

Figure 4. A demonstration of the bound structure of 3CLpro (PDB ID: 6LU7, where the ligand was colored in red) with molecular docking. The left-hand side shows the results of the top 20 docking poses (colored in blue). Eight out of 20 docking poses are located in the binding pocket of the protein. Th right-hand side zooms in the binding pocket and shows that the top docking pose (colored in blue) is close to the bound ligand (colored in red).  

After finishing docking, AutoDock Vina will generate multiple docking poses for each ligand–protein pair. For the sake of a straightforward representation of the docking results, the top 20 docking poses from AutoDock Vina were taken to build a protein heatmap. For each pose, a sphere centered at the centroid of ligand with a radius of $\dot{5}\mathring\mathrm{A}$ is highlighted, and the frequency of residues inside the sphere is incremented. The protein heatmap and the ligand docking position with the best affinity score are shown on the main page of each entry (a ligand–protein pair) in DockCoV2, where the red scale of the protein heatmap denotes the frequency of residues over twenty trials. Figure 4 is a demonstration of the structure of 3CLpro (PDB ID: 6LU7) (10) with molecular docking. In order to validate our virtual screening pipeline, we separated the original structure into a ligand and a receptor, and docked them with the proposed pipeline. The left-hand side of Figure 4 shows that eight out of the top 20 docking poses (colored in blue) are located in the binding pocket of the protein. This figure also demonstrates that users can explore the binding pocket through the hot spot of our heatmap. The right-hand side zooms in the binding pocket and shows that the top docking pose (colored in blue) of our pipeline is close to the ligand (colored in red) in the crystal structure. For reproducing our results or repurposing the proposed pipeline for other drugs or proteins, we released our scripts and the configuration file for docking procedures on GitHub (https://github.com/ailabstw/DockCoV2).  

# INTERFACE  

In order to provide an efficient searching interface for users, we built a website with a search engine based on Django 3.0 (https://djangoproject.com) and Bootstrap 4.3.1 (https: //getbootstrap.com/). The search bar, which can be found either in the index page or on navbar, allows the user to input the drug name, PubChem CID or synonym to explore the docking score with all proteins. The details of each ligand are shown after choosing a specific ligand– protein pair, including docking structure, ligand information and experimental data. PDBQT files of ligand and protein from AutoDock Vina are also provided on the main page of each ligand-protein pair. In the docking structure panel, both protein heatmap and sequences are displayed on the right-side of the detail page. Protein heatmap is interactively demonstrated with the NGL viewer tool, which is a WebGL-based molecular viewer (57). To easily visualize the targeted binding sites on the proteins, not only basic operations on protein heatmap, but also selecting or limiting atoms/residues through the selection language is available on the docking structure panel. The ligand information panel is divided into ligand relative, clinical relative, druglikeness, other relative info and drug similarity. Ligand relative part consists of basic compound Information, including 3D structure view, CAS number, SMILES, InChI, InChI key, synonyms and pathway from KEGG Drug and KEGG Compound databases. Clinical Relative consists of approval information, which denotes whether or not this ligand has been approved by the Taiwan NHI or FDA, as well as other corresponding data from Drug Repurposing Hub, including clinical phase, mechanism of action (MoA), target, disease area, and indication. Results and components of Lipinski’s rule of five, Ghose filter, Veber filter and REOS filter are shown in druglikeness section. External links to PubChem and Drugbank are also provided in the other relative info section. SARS-CoV-2 relative, related documents and drug assays are included in experimental data.  

# CONCLUSION  

Drug repositioning, the exploration of repurposing existing drugs that have already passed the safety screening for new indications, is a relatively quick therapeutic solution for emerging infectious diseases like SARS-CoV-2. For the purpose of drug repositioning, molecular docking is a well-known virtual screening method to evaluate a great amount of compounds automatically. Based on the urgent need to find effective drugs, we established DockCoV2, the first virtual screening database for SARS-CoV-2. DockCoV2 focuses on predicting 2285 FDA-approved and 1478 Taiwan NHI-approved drugs targeting five proteins relating to the mechanism of viral entry and replication. Those docked structures could also be further utilized and get more accurate binding poses and the correct ranking of the binding affinity through methods such as molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzman surface area (MM/PBSA) and molecular mechanics generalized Boltzman surface area (MM/GBSA) calculations (22,58). In addition, DockCoV2 also provides experimental data, including biological assays, pathway information, and gene set enrichment analysis recruited from other validated databases. Future versions will include the prediction of binding affinity with other potentially druggable targets against SARS-CoV-2 and the reported experimental assays and high-throughput screening results to support our prediction.

# ABSTRACT  

Large numbers of long RNAs with little or no protein-coding potential [long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)] are being identified in eukaryotes. In parallel, increasing data describing the expression profiles, molecular features and functions of individual lncRNAs in a variety of systems are accumulating. To enable the systematic compilation and updating of this information, we have developed a database (lncRNAdb) containing a comprehensive list of lncRNAs that have been shown to have, or to be associated with, biological functions in eukaryotes, as well as messenger RNAs that have regulatory roles. Each entry contains referenced information about the RNA, including sequences, structural information, genomic context, expression, subcellular localization, conservation, functional evidence and other relevant information. lncRNAdb can be searched by querying published RNA names and aliases, sequences, species and associated protein-coding genes, as well as terms contained in the annotations, such as the tissues in which the transcripts are expressed and associated diseases. In addition, lncRNAdb is linked to the UCSC Genome Browser for visualization and Noncoding RNA Expression Database (NRED) for expression information from a variety of sources. lncRNAdb provides a platform for the ongoing collation of the literature pertaining to lncRNAs and their association with other genomic elements. lncRNAdb can be accessed at: http://www .lncrnadb.org/.  

# INTRODUCTION  

The eukaryotic transcriptome is enormous, and comprises not only a large set of protein-coding messenger RNAs, but also large numbers of non-protein coding transcripts that have structural, regulatory or unknown functions (1). Noncoding RNAs include intergenic transcripts as well as a complex array of RNAs that overlap protein-coding loci on both strands (2–4), including promoter-associated RNAs (4), intronic RNAs (5), convergent and bi-directional transcripts (3), noncoding alternatively spliced isoforms of protein-coding genes (6) and mRNAs that also have regulatory roles as untranslated RNAs (7,8). While some of these RNAs are processed to form small RNA species such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), many can have diverse roles as primary or spliced long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) (9). In structural terms, lncRNAs range in size from approximately 100 to 100 000 bases, can be spliced or unspliced, polyadenylated or non-polyadenylated, nuclear or cytoplasmic, and are usually transcribed by RNA polymerase II and/or III (10).  

The combination of different experimental methodologies to study the transcriptome of several species has resulted in a continuous discovery of novel transcripts (11), with the FANTOM project alone cataloguing more than $30\ 000$ putative lncRNA transcripts in mouse tissues by full-length cDNA cloning (2). This provides a challenge for their molecular and functional characterization, as well as for their cataloguing. Although the subset of lncRNAs characterized to date corresponds to a small fraction of the long noncoding transcripts in multicellular organisms, growing interest in the field has resulted in a rapid increase in the characterization of individual lncRNAs in a variety of systems.  

A decade ago less than a dozen lncRNAs were recognized and catalogued in all eukaryotes (12), but following the dramatic increase in their numbers, a recent catalogue listed approximately 40 functionally characterized lncRNAs in mammals alone (13). This list contained lncRNAs whose functions had been assessed either by loss- or gain-of-function experiments, and did not include many that have other types of evidence for functionality. For example, several studies have documented the cell type-specific and/or dynamic expression of hundreds of long ncRNAs in various developmental systems, such as embryonic stem cell differentiation (14) and oligodendrogenesis (15), finding in each case different subsets of differentially expressed lncRNAs.  

These studies have indicated that lncRNAs comprise a class of bona fide gene products that have been largely unaccounted for in public databases such as RefSeq (16), UniGene (17) and the Mammalian Gene Collection (18). While there are databases cataloguing ncRNAs, these have been predominantly focused on well-validated classes of small RNAs and contain limited data pertaining to lncRNAs. Recently, a database with diverse information on imprinted RNAs was made available, which is largely comprised of small RNAs, such as piRNAs (piwi-interacting RNAs), but also contains imprinted lncRNAs, and is restricted to mammals (19). Our previous database of noncoding RNAs, RNAdb (20), was also limited to mammals, and included all classes of regulatory RNAs, such as snoRNAs, piRNAs and miRNAs. Due to the rapid expansion in each of these classes, they are now independently curated in dedicated databases, including miRbase (21), piRNAbank (22) and Sno/scaRNAbase (23). Consequently, there is a need for a dedicated database of lncRNAs that includes not only mammalian lncRNAs, but detailed annotations of lncRNAs from all eukaryotic species.  

# AIMS OF THE DATABASE  

lncRNAdb provides a central repository of known lncRNAs in eukaryotic cells (including those derived from viruses), their aliases and published characteristics. A well-collated library will greatly facilitate research of these poorly annotated genes. It also aims to decrease instances of replication and unknown identity by the inclusion of aliases such as $p l5A S$ , which was reported as a novel antisense RNA (24), but appears to be an unspliced isoform of a previously described ncRNA called ANRIL (25), and Gomafu (26), which is also known as MIAT (27) and RNCR2 (28).  

The centralization of lncRNAdb enables integration with other resources including the UCSC Genome Browser (29) and the Noncoding RNA Expression Database (NRED) (30), which provide insight into genomic context and expression data. This ensures that researchers interested in lncRNAs can conveniently find a wide range of information regarding genes of interest from a single location.  

Currently, the characteristics and functions of most lncRNAs are still unexplored, but it is expected that the number of studied RNAs will rapidly increase by in silico, in vitro and in vivo characterization. By providing a simple interface accessible to public users, we aim to provide a tool for the scientific community that will allow existing entries to be updated, modified to improve accuracy, and new entries to be added by users. Following verification of new published data by the curators, the information will become available in lncRNAdb.  

# DATABASE STRUCTURE  

lncRNAdb is available online at: http://www.lncrnadb .org. Users can search the database by lncRNA name, nucleotide sequence string, species, annotation status or through a full-text search with results being displayed for online perusal and available as a tab delimited file download.  

Annotated entries include one or more literature references, annotations across a series of categories and a list of species in which the lncRNA is observed. Literature references and genomic coordinates are hyperlinked to PubMed and the UCSC Genome Browser, respectively. Other biological components related to the annotated lncRNAs, such as genomically-associated genes or interacting proteins, are also listed and briefly described in a separate table that provides links to the PubMed reference.  

The lncRNAdb database also links to NRED, our online expression analysis application for ncRNAs in mouse and human (30). This extends the database through access to relative expression levels of both the lncRNAs and their contextually related transcripts in various public microarray experiments, such as NCode data and the GNF atlas (31), as well as the Allen Brain Atlas (32), which includes mouse brain in situ expression data for over 800 expressed lncRNAs (33).  

The application architecture consists of a Microsoft asp.NET 3.5 presentation layer $({\mathrm{c}}\#)$ , ${\tt c}\#4.0$ data model and application layer, and MySQL persistent storage.  

# QUERYING THE DATABASE  

Querying the database is a matter of entering one or more search criteria (Figure 1A); a full or partial lncRNA name (or alias), a search string to interrogate each ncRNA’s annotations or a species in which the lncRNA is known, or any combination of those. lncRNAdb will return a list of matching entries whose full detail can be viewed by clicking on the lncRNA name.  

To download the database values for the entire list as a file of tab delimited text, users can click on the ‘Export Results’ button under the search results.  

# lncRNAdb CONTENT  

Although lncRNAs have been defined previously as transcripts ${>}200$ nt (9), this was an arbitrary definition largely based on a convenient biochemical cutoff in RNA isolation protocols and the fact that it excluded most known small RNAs. In an effort to make a clear distinction to small RNA species and to create a more biologically meaningful definition of lncRNAs, we consider lncRNAs as noncoding RNAs that may have a function as either primary or spliced transcripts, which is independent of processing into known classes of small RNAs, such as miRNAs, piRNAs and snoRNAs, while also excluding structural RNAs from classical housekeeping families (tRNAs, snoRNAs, spliceosomal RNAs, etc). Existing databases and archives, including Sno/scaRNAbase (23), miRBase (21), tRNAdb-CE (34) and piRNAbank (22), already represent such ncRNAs. However, some lncRNAs that are host genes for small RNA species (35,36), but may also have roles as regulatory lncRNAs, have been included in the annotations. An example is the GAS5 lncRNA, which is a repressor of the glucocorticoid receptor but also encodes several intronic snoRNAs (37).  

The database currently contains over 150 lncRNAs identified from the literature in around 60 different species. Each entry contains a comprehensive range of available information about the RNA, including sequences, structural information, genomic context, expression, subcellular localization, conservation, functional evidence and relevant ‘miscellaneous’ information (see e.g. in Figure 1B). As expected, most $(\sim75\%)$ of catalogued lncRNAs are from mammals, for which more transcriptomic data is available and which have been more intensively studied, but lncRNAs from vertebrates to single-celled eukaryotes have been included.  

Among the entries in lncRNAdb, approximately 100 have functions directly tested by in vitro and/or in vivo experiments. For quick reference, these have been listed in Supplementary Table S1, highlighting the wide array of functional mechanisms and processes affected by

lncRNAs. This list is not exhaustive, but it catalogues functional lncRNAs found not only in mammals but also lncRNAs tested in diverse eukaryotic species, such as meiRNA (38) in yeast, frq antisense RNAs in Neurospora crassa (39), rncs-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans (40), IPS1 (41) in plants, Xlsirts in frogs (42) and bereft in Drosophila (43). In addition to RNAs expressed in normal physiological states, the database contains information about RNAs expressed in disease, and even lncRNAs derived from viruses and expressed in eukaryotic cells during infection (see below). Examples of lncRNA categories that can be used to limit queries are listed below.  

# Imprinted lncRNAs  

LncRNAs are prevalent in imprinted regions where they can function to control imprinting and the expression of other genes from the locus, such as Air (44) and Kncq1ot1 (45). Some imprinted lncRNAs are host genes for small RNAs, such as Bsr (46), where the lncRNA host has no known function; or has an independent function, e.g. the putative tumour suppressor Meg3/Gtl2 (47).  

# Disease associated lncRNAs  

Underscoring their importance in cellular functions, a growing number of lncRNAs have been implicated in a variety of diseases, including cancer. These are described in the database and include putative or confirmed cancer-associated lncRNAs, such as NDM29 (48), HOTAIR, which regulates metastatic progression (49), and H19, which has been described as both an oncogene (50) and a tumour suppressor (51). We also include lncRNAs that have been implicated in neurological functions and diseases, including BACE1AS (52) that shows increased expression in Alzheimer’s disease, and the Drosophila hsr-o gene, which is induced by a variety of stresses and which has been shown to greatly increase protein polyglutamine-induced toxicity and neurodegeneration (53).  

In addition, the observation that a substantial fraction of the genotypic variation underlying complex phenotypic traits occurs in noncoding regions, many of which are transcribed into discrete lncRNAs, has led to the appreciation that lncRNAs may play a central role in the molecular etiology of complex diseases (13). We have catalogued RNAs associated with these loci in lncRNAdb, such as ANRIL, a well-characterized lncRNA located in the complex genetic susceptibility locus INK4b/ARF/INK4a implicated in coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, periodontitis and cancer (24,54,55). We opted to also include uncharacterized lncRNAs linked to diseasesusceptibility loci, as cataloguing these transcripts may facilitate their recognition as candidates for functional studies in normal and pathological conditions. Examples include AK023948, which is located in a susceptibility locus to papillary thyroid tumour (56), and LOC285194, which is located in a copy number alteration and loss-of-heterozygosity region in osteosarcoma (57).  

# Pathogen-induced or derived lncRNAs  

Some lncRNAs are produced and modulated by pathogens or host cells during infection. These have been mostly omitted from other noncoding RNA catalogues, but incorporated in lncRNAdb. These include eukaryotic parasite transcripts such as the Pinci1 ncRNA family in the fungal plant-pathogen Phytophthora infestans, which are specifically upregulated during infection (58), and mammalian lncRNAs that are induced during viral infection (59), such as Neat1/VINC in the mouse brain (60), or produced in infected cells by oncogenic viruses, such as human herpesviruses (61). Indeed, the accumulating examples of lncRNAs encoded by viruses and expressed in eukaryotic cells have been annotated in lncRNAdb, because they can regulate cell function and are relevant to disease etiology. For instance, $\beta2.7$ is a ${\sim}2.7\mathrm{kb}$ ncRNA encoded in the herpesvirus HCMV genome that is rapidly accumulated upon infection and has a fundamental role in preventing metabolic dysfunction and apoptosis of the host cell (62).  

# Bifunctional RNAs  

An emerging class of genes is those encoding bifunctional RNAs, which can have multiple independent roles, such as acting as a regulatory lncRNA or being translated into a protein. Examples include well-known lncRNAs such as the co-activator $S R A$ transcript, isoforms of which also encode a protein (8,63), and known protein coding genes, such as $p53$ , whose transcripts also act as regulatory RNAs (7). In some cases, splicing isoforms are known to encode a protein, whereas specific splicing isoforms encode regulatory lncRNAs, such as the LXRB/ LXRBSV isoform pair (6).  

# lncRNAs of unknown function  

lncRNAdb includes RNAs that are well described in the literature but whose functions have yet to be identified. These regions are transcribed into lncRNAs that have been characterized to some extent at the structural and/ or expression level, including dozens of lncRNAs that show tissue specificity and dynamic expression during development (64), as well as cellular localization, suggestive of undiscovered functionality. Likewise, the database also includes transcripts such as PHO5 antisense lncRNA in yeast (65) where it is not yet established whether the functional role is conveyed by the lncRNA or its transcription.  

# FUTURE DIRECTIONS  

The data in lncRNAdb will be extended through manual curation by the authors and submissions to the site by other researchers on an ongoing basis. The lowering cost and improved depths of RNA-sequencing methodologies is already enabling transcriptomics studies for alternative model- and non-model species, and it is expected that the identification and characterization of lncRNAs will follow, which may substantially increase the representation of non-mammalian species in the database. New functionality will be included with integration of the publicly available successor to NRED (NRED2) early in 2011, giving access to not only additional microarray expression data but also transcriptomic RNA-seq data for contextually related long noncoding and coding genes, tools for visualization of the lncRNA and cross-referencing of experimental expression profiles. Finally, the absence of a centralized database of lncRNAs is reflected by the ad hoc naming of newly identified members, which are often not self-consistent and potentially confusing. With the number of functional lncRNAs likely to be very large, it will be important to establish a standardized nomenclature to minimize confusion and allow this emerging field to be as accessible as possible to all biologists.

# ABSTRACT  

Brain is the central organ of the nervous system and any brain disease can seriously affect human health. Here we present BrainBase (https://ngdc.cncb.ac. cn/brainbase), a curated knowledgebase for brain diseases that aims to provide a whole picture of brain diseases and associated genes. Specifically, based on manual curation of 2768 published articles along with information retrieval from several public databases, BrainBase features comprehensive collection of 7175 disease–gene associations spanning a total of 123 brain diseases and linking with 5662 genes, 16 591 drug–target interactions covering 2118 drugs/chemicals and 623 genes, and five types of specific genes in light of expression specificity in brain tissue/regions/cerebrospinal fluid/cells. In addition, considering the severity of glioma among brain tumors, the current version of BrainBase incorporates 21 multi-omics datasets, presents molecular profiles across various samples/conditions and identifies four groups of glioma featured genes with potential clinical significance. Collectively, BrainBase integrates not only valuable curated disease– gene associations and drug–target interactions but also molecular profiles through multi-omics data analysis, accordingly bearing great promise to serve as a valuable knowledgebase for brain diseases.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Brain is the central organ of the nervous system, not only controlling thoughts, memory, speech, and movement, but also regulating the function of many organs (1). Any brain disease that alters brain function or structure, can seriously affect human health. For instance, glioma, one of the most common types of brain tumors, represents $\sim80\%$ of malignant brain tumors and exhibits low resection rate and high recurrence risk (2,3). Nowadays, increasing brain-related projects have been launched throughout the world, e.g. Human Brain Project in Europe (4), BRAIN Initiative in US (5), Brain/MINDS in Japan (6), China Brain Project (7), etc., with the aim to deepen our understanding of brain diseases, structure and function and to accelerate brainderived applications in health, computing, and technology. Particularly, powered by high-throughput sequencing technologies, great efforts have been devoted to deciphering complex associations between genes and brain diseases from multiple omics levels (2,8–11). However, these valuable disease–gene associations (as well as omics datasets) are scattered in massive scientific publications, thus making their retrieval, integration and visualization very arduous and time-consuming. Although several related resources have already been developed with different purposes, there still lacks a comprehensive resource dedicated for brain diseases that includes high-quality associations extracted from published literatures. Specifically, the Developmental Brain Disorders Database (DBDB, https://www.dbdb. urmc.rochester.edu) aims to provide a number of genes, phenotypes, and syndromes associated only with neurodevelopmental disorders (12), the Ivy Glioblastoma Atlas Project (Ivy GAP, http://glioblastoma.alleninstitute.org) focuses on the anatomic and genetic basis of glioblastoma at the cellular and molecular levels (13), the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA, http://www.cgga.org.cn) is devoted to providing open access to glioma datasets and offering interactive visualization of multi-omics profiles (14), GlioVis (http://gliovis.bioinfo.cnio.es) is a web application for visualization and analysis of brain tumors’ expression datasets (15) and STAB (http://stab.comp-sysbio.org) is a spatio-temporal cell atlas with the aim to understand both the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders and the development of the normal human brain (16). Despite this, a comprehensive collection of high-quality disease–gene associations covering a diversity of brain diseases is highly desirable.  

Here, we present BrainBase (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/ brainbase), a curated knowledgebase for brain diseases that is dedicated to the curation, integration and visualization of brain diseases-related knowledge. Unlike extant relevant databases, BrainBase features comprehensive collection of high-quality disease–gene associations, drug–target interactions and multi-omics datasets. Accordingly, BrainBase not only integrates a large number of valuable knowledge associations and interactions manually curated from published literatures but also includes a wide range of molecular profiles through multi-omics data analysis, thus bearing great promise to serve as a valuable knowledgebase for uncovering molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of brain diseases.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Knowledge curation and integration  

Disease-gene associations were extracted from 2768 published literatures, with literature curation on 510 glioma publications due to its severity among brain tumors and information retrieval from related databases, including DBDB (12), Brain Disease Knowledgebase (http://birg1. fbb.utm.my/bddb), HMDD (17), LncBook (18), EWAS Atlas (19), GWAS Catalog (20), EDK (21) and CRMarker (22). Drug-target interactions were collected from ChEMBL (23), DrugBank (24), CMap (25), PharmGKB (26) and CTD (27). In the current version of BrainBase, it was found that drugs were designed for 8 common brain diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, glioma, glioblastoma, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, medulloblastoma and cerebral palsy.  

To unify disease name and definition, terms or identifiers of Disease Ontology (DO) were retrieved and mapped to the corresponding diseases (28). In order to provide consistent names for all collected genes in BrainBase, gene names were unified with the help of the gene symbol-alias conversion table from the HGNC database (2021.4.23 version) (29).  

# Data collection  

Multi-omics datasets were obtained from several well-known public databases, including GEO (30) TCGA (31), GTEx (32), HPA (33), Ivy GAP (13) and CGGA (14). Totally, 21 open-access datasets were included in BrainBase and publicly available without restrictions at ftp://download.big.ac.cn/brainbase. Detailed information about these datasets can be accessible at https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/brainbase/faq. Among these datasets, GSE50161, GSE59612, GSE4290, GSE111260, GSE36278, GSE60274, GSE61160, GSE50923, CGGA 301, CGGA 325, CGGA 693, CGGA methylation, TCGA expression,  

TCGA methylation and TCGA CNV were used to identify glioma featured genes.  

# Computational identification of specific genes  

We identified genes specifically expressed in brain tissue, regions and cells, as well as genes that are detected in the special ‘tissue’ cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): (i) brain-specific genes: a dataset from GTEx v7 (32) (15 January 2016) containing 11 688 samples across 53 tissue sites was used for identification of brain-specific genes. Since tissues may have multiple different sites, gene expression levels were averaged over sites that were from the same tissue. To reduce background noise, genes with maximum expression level smaller than 1 TPM (Transcripts Per Million) were removed. Finally, based on the expression profiles across 31 tissues, we calculated the tissue specificity index $\ulcorner$ for each gene to identify tissue-specific genes (34,35). In this study, brainspecific genes were defined as those genes that are specifically expressed in brain with $\tau>0.9$ . As a consequence, a list of 639 brain-specific genes were identified, including 475 mRNAs, 2 miRNAs, 127 lncRNAs and 4 pseudogenes; (ii) brain-region-specific genes: based on the GTEx dataset, 546 brain-region-specific genes were identified with the tissue specificity index $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ , expressed specifically in 12 brain regions, including cerebellum, cerebellar hemisphere, spinal cord (cervical c-1), hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens (basal ganglia), substantia nigra, frontal cortex (BA9), cortex, hippocampus, putamen (basal ganglia), amygdala and caudate (basal ganglia); (iii) brain-specific proteins: a list of 215 proteins specifically expressed in brain were obtained from the HPA database (33); (iv) cell markers: a total of 328 brain cell marker genes were collected from CellMarker (36) and Cell Taxonomy (https://ngdc.cncb.ac. cn/celltaxonomy); and (v) CSF proteins: 1126 proteins detected in CSF with their fluorescence intensity were obtained from GEO (GSE83710) (37,38).  

# Identification of glioma featured genes  

Glioma, a severe brain tumor, represents ${\sim}80\%$ of malignant brain tumors, can be classified into low-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (39). Powered by high-throughput sequencing technologies, a set of molecular biomarkers have been found to benefit glioma diagnosis and prognosis; among them, isocitrate dehydrogenase $(I D H)$ mutation and $1\mathrm{p}/19\mathrm{q}$ co-deletion (codel) are two most important genetic events (35,40). Since it was reported that glioma is related to other brain diseases (41,42), identification of glioma featured genes by comparing the following four pairs, namely, Glioma vs Normal, GBM versus LGG, $I D H$ wildtype vs $I D H$ mutation, and 1p19q noncodel vs $1\mathsf{p}19\mathsf{q}$ codel, is of great significance for studying glioma and other brain diseases. Therefore, to identify glioma featured genes, student’s t-test was performed at multi-omics levels and the $P$ -values were adjusted by the false discovery rate (FDR) described by Benjamini and Hochberg (43), namely, four pairs (as mentioned above) at the expression level, 4 pairs (as mentioned above) at the DNA methylation level (promoter region) and 3 pairs (except Glioma vs Normal) at the CNV level, which were denoted as E4, M4 and C3, respectively. As a result, four groups of featured genes were identified: (i) ubiquitously differential genes (UDGs): genes exhibit significant differences ubiquitously in E4, M4 and C3 ( $P$ -value $<0.001$ , FDR $<0.01\dot{}$ ); (ii) differentially expressed genes (DEGs): genes exhibit significant differences in E4 ( $P$ -value $<0.001$ , FDR $<0.01\dot$ ); (iii) differentially DNA-methylated genes (DMGs): genes exhibit significant differences in M4 ( $P$ - value $<0.001$ , FDR $<0.01$ ) and (iv) differential CNV genes (DCGs): genes exhibit significant differences in C3 ( $P$ -value $<0.001$ , $\mathrm{FDR}<0.01$ ).  

# Database construction and web interface implementation  

BrainBase was built based on Apache Tomcat Server (http: //tomcat.apache.org) and MySQL (http://www.mysql.org). Web interfaces were developed by JSP, HTML5, CSS3, AJAX, JQuery and BootStrap (version 3.3.7). Omics profiles were visualized by HTML widgets and R packages including plumber (version 1.1.0), ggplot2 (version 3.3.4), ggpubr (version 0.4.0), survminer (version 0.4.9) and survival (version 3.2). ECharts (version 4.1.0) was also adopted to generate interactive charts.  

# DATABASE CONTENTS AND USAGE  

BrainBase presents a comprehensive collection of highquality knowledge entries including disease–gene associations and drug–target interactions, houses five types of specific genes in terms of expression specificity, incorporates multi-omics molecular profiles across various samples/conditions, and identifies four groups of glioma featured genes with potential significance in clinical application (Figure 1).  

# Disease-gene associations  

Given great efforts that have been devoted to the identification of genes associated with brain diseases, it is critical to build a comprehensive view of disease–gene associations across diverse brain diseases (44,45). Hence, based on literature curation and integration with controlled vocabularies (see details in Materials and Methods), the current version of BrainBase houses a total of 7175 disease–gene associations spanning a total of 123 brain diseases and linking with 5662 genes. Based on this, BrainBase is capable to capture a whole picture of brain diseases and associated genes (Figure 2). Notably, the top five diseases by associations, according to the current accumulation of brain-related studies, are Alzheimer’s disease, autism spectrum disorder, glioma, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease (Figure 2A). In addition, BrainBase provides a landscape of hot genes (with different types, including mRNA, miRNA and lncRNA) that are closely associated with brain diseases. Strikingly, hsamir-146 (miRNA), GRIA2 (mRNA) and MEG3 (lncRNA) are representative genes associated with 13, 7 and 9 brain diseases, respectively (Figure 2B).  

Considering that glioma is highly malignant among brain diseases and associated with either aberrant activities of genes or abnormal upstream regulators/downstream targets (46,47), here we propose a curation model with particular focus on glioma to standardize the curation process and establish controlled vocabularies and descriptive terms (that are abstracted and categorized based on literature curation) to depict each item (for details see https: //ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/brainbase/faq). Based on this model, a wide range of important items are curated from publications, including molecular role (e.g. gene type, omics information, tumor process, pathway, description and PMID), regulation axis (e.g., regulator type/name/effect and target type/name/effect) and experimental sample (e.g. subtype, grade, species and tissue/cell line). As a consequence, among all the 7175 associations, 656 glioma entries are further curated and obtained, which are associated with 363 genes; the top ten genes in terms of disease–gene associations are IDH1, EGFR, MGMT, TP53, IDH2, PTEN, FGFR1, PDGFRA, EGFRVIII and $H3–3A$ (Figure 2C), consistent well with previous findings (11,48–49) that these genes are closely related with glioma. Additionally, BrainBase obtains a whole picture of glioma pathways and processes; the top five pathways are AKT, Wnt/ $\upbeta$ -catenin, Purine Biosynthesis, PI3K/AKT/mTOR and Notch (Figure 2D) and the top five processes are proliferation, invasion, suppression, aggressiveness and growth (Figure 2E), potentially providing an integrated landscape of underlying etiology of glioma.  

# Drug–target interactions  

Accumulating evidence have shown that drug targeted genes can be involved in multiple diseases (50,51). Therefore, BrainBase incorporates a large number of 16,591 drug–target interactions involving 2118 drugs/chemicals and 623 genes and focusing on 8 common diseases (see details in Materials and Methods). For example, TNF, a gene encoding a proinflammatory cytokine (52), is a targeted gene shared by glioma, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease, and BDNF, one of the neurotrophic factors (53), is a targeted gene shared by autism spectrum disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease (Figure 2F), implying the potential of these core targeted genes as therapeutic opportunities. In addition, considering that the trend of drug design is from single target to multiple targets (54,55), we find that in BrainBase, the collected drugs/chemicals overall have six targets on average. Among them, noticeably, afimoxifene, associating with the seven diseases, interacts with three genes in autism spectrum disorder, 14 genes in Alzheimer’s disease, seven genes in epilepsy, eight genes in Parkinson’s disease, seveb genes in medulloblastoma, 12 genes in glioblastoma and 13 genes in glioma (https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/brainbase/drugs). Collectively, BrainBase features comprehensive integration of drug–target interactions, yielding a set of genes for drug target selection in brain diseases.  

# Potential significance of specific genes  

Specifically expressed genes at multi-omics levels are likely associated with diseases and targeted by drugs with potential clinical application (56–58). Thus, through computational identification based on the GTEx v7 (15 January 2016) dataset, BrainBase provides five types of specific genes, namely, 639 brain-specific genes specifically expressed in brain tissue (RNA level), 546 brain-regionspecific genes in 12 brain regions (RNA level), 328 cell markers in 23 cell types (RNA level), 1126 CSF proteins (protein level) and 215 brain-specific proteins (protein level), respectively (see Materials and Methods). Intriguingly, we find among the disease-associated/drug–targeted genes, 192 are brain-specific, 91 are brain-region-specific, 134 are brain cell markers, 373 are CSF associated genes and 94 are brain-specific proteins (Supplementary Tables S1–S5). Clearly, these results indicate that the five types of specific genes are of great potential for clinical applications. Meanwhile, it should be noted that brain-regionspecific genes may not reflect the unique features of different regions, since it has been reported that brain regions have close functional connectivity with other regions (59,60). To facilitate users to perform in-depth investigations on these specific genes, BrainBase provides open access to these genes as well as their details (e.g. cell type, brain region, expression level and gene type) at https://ngdc.cncb. ac.cn/brainbase/genes.

# Glioma multi-omics profiles and featured gene groups  

Considering the severity of glioma among brain tumors, the current version of BrainBase collects 21 datasets from worldwide public resources, and exhibits multi-omics molecular profiles (expression, DNA methylation and CNV) across various samples/conditions (Figure 3). For any given gene of interest, BrainBase provides a wealth of multi-omics molecular levels across diverse conditions, including glioma vs normal, different grades (G4 vs G3 vs G2), $I D H$ status, 1p19q status, IDH & 1p19q status, MGMT status, cell subtype and survival (Figure 3A-C). In addition, BrainBase offers a series of charts for visualizing omics profiles, which can be also downloaded in PDF format.  

In order to provide candidate genes for glioma studies, based on these collected multi-omics datasets, four groups of glioma featured genes are identified (Figure 3D), namely, UDGs, DEGs, DMGs and DCGs (see Materials and Methods). In this study, UDGs are defined as differential genes that exhibit significant differences ubiquitously at multi-omics levels, DEGs/DMGs/DCGs are defined as genes with significant differences at the expression/DNA methylation/CNV level, respectively. As a result, a total of 1387 UDGs, 8675 DEGs, 9448 DMGs and 10 696 DCGs are obtained, which are publicly available at https://ngdc. cncb.ac.cn/brainbase/featured genes.

Remarkably, we find that these featured genes cover several well-known biomarkers, e.g. MGMT in UDGs, IDH1 in DEGs, ADAR in DMGs, and EGFR in DCGs, respectively. Specifically, MGMT, a key gene for DNA repair, is associated with glioma survival and clinical treatment (11). $A D A R$ , a gene encoding the enzyme responsible for RNA editing (61), is associated with GBM cell proliferation (62). In our previous study, PRKCG, a member of protein kinase C (PKC) family (63), is in UDGs and can be used for glioma diagnosis, prognosis and treatment prediction (35). In addition, functional enrichment analysis of these 1,387 UDGs shows that UDGs are significantly associated with TNF signaling pathway, rap1 signaling pathway, proteoglycans in cancer, positive regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade, inflammatory response and angiogenesis (Figure 3E and F). Importantly, among 5,976 brain-diseases’ associated genes,  

285 genes are UDGs, including 65 glioma-associated genes (Supplementary Table S6) and 236 genes associated with other brain diseases (Supplementary Table S7), clearly indicating that UDGs are of utmost importance with potential clinical application for brain diseases.  

# DISCUSSION AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS  

In this study, we present BrainBase, a comprehensive knowledgebase that provides a high-quality collection of brain diseases, associated genes, drugs and omics profiles. Based on manual curation and integration from published literatures and related databases, the current version of BrainBase houses 7,175 disease–gene associations, 16 591 drug–target interactions, 21 multi-omics datasets, five types of specific genes and four groups of featured genes. As an important resource of the National Genomics Data Center (NGDC, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn) (64), BrainBase is devoted to serving as an open-access resource for studying brain diseases. Future directions include: (i) frequent curation and incorporation of disease–gene associations and drug–target interactions; (ii) integration and analysis of more multi-omics datasets for common brain diseases and (iii) improvement of web interfaces and development of tools in aid of multi-omics data mining and visualization. We also call for worldwide scientists to work together to build BrainBase into a valuable resource covering more comprehensive associations, interactions and omics datasets and further providing high-quality curated knowledge for brain research.

# ABSTRACT  

Protein post-translational modifications (PTMs) play a pivotal role in numerous biological processes by modulating regulation of protein function. We have developed iPTMnet (http://proteininformationresource.org/iPTMnet)  

for PTM knowledge discovery, employing an integrative bioinformatics approach––combining text mining, data mining, and ontological representation to capture rich PTM information, including PTM enzyme-substrate-site relationships, PTM-specific protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and PTM conservation across species. iPTMnet encompasses data from (i) our PTM-focused text mining tools, RLIMS-P and eFIP, which extract phosphorylation information from full-scale mining of PubMed abstracts and full-length articles; (ii) a set of curated databases with experimentally observed PTMs; and iii) Protein Ontology that organizes proteins and PTM proteoforms, enabling their representation, annotation and comparison within and across species. Presently covering eight major PTM types (phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, methylation, glycosylation, S-nitrosylation, sumoylation and myristoylation), iPTMnet knowledgebase contains more than 654 500 unique PTM sites in over 62 100 proteins, along with more than 1200 PTM enzymes and over 24 300 PTM enzyme-substrate-site relations. The website supports online search, browsing, retrieval and visual analysis for scientific queries. Several examples, including functional interpretation of phosphoproteomic data, demonstrate iPTMnet as a gateway for visual exploration and systematic analysis of PTM networks and conservation, thereby enabling PTM discovery and hypothesis generation.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Proteins are the link between biological information in the genome and the function of cells and organisms. Protein post-translational modification, or PTM, is a major source of protein diversity. PTMs are prevalent and diverse $(>620$ types as cataloged in RESID (1)) and offer an additional level of regulation that allows a rapid, controlled and reversible response to environmental cues (2), for example, by dynamically altering interaction partner preferences in response to stimuli. These conditional interactions can either be mediated through single modification events, or often, through coordinated modification of multiple PTM types on multiple sites (3). To orchestrate these complex PTM events, the cell exerts tight control over the enzymes that add and remove PTMs; aberrations in PTM and PTM enzyme activity have been implicated in many diseases, including cancer (4) and neurodegeneration (5). Thus, a comprehensive picture of PTMs, as well as the multiple factors that control PTM enzyme activity are vital to understanding how cells function in health and disease.  

There presently exists a number of molecular databases that focus entirely or partially on PTMs. Some cover multiple PTM types in specific taxon groups (e.g. PhosphoSitePlus (6) and PHOSIDA (7)); others focus on specific PTM types (e.g. OGlycBase (8), UniCarbKB (9), UbiProt (10), Phospho.ELM (11), PhosphoPep (12), PhosPhAt (13) and $\mathrm{P}^{3}\mathrm{D}\dot{\mathbf{B}}$ (14)). Some resources, such as UniProtKB (15), NeXtProt (16) and PomBase (17) are not PTM centric but have expertly curated PTM information within their entry records. Another resource, PTMcode2 (18), uses evolutionary data, structural data, and curated information from the literature to predict PTM interactions or cross-talk. dbPTM (19) integrates data from many of these resources with a special emphasis on structural aspects of the modified protein region, predicted PTM sites, and PTM sites associated with drug binding. Still, there is a need for an integrated resource that emphasizes PTM protein relationships with upstream modifying enzymes and downstream interacting partners, proteoforms(distinct molecular forms in which the protein product of a single gene can be found, including changes due to genetic variations, alternatively spliced RNA transcripts and PTMs) (20), and PTM conservation across species. Moreover, an integrated resource can play an important role in disseminating valuable PTM information in resources that are no longer being actively updated in the context of more recent information.  

We have developed iPTMnet, an integrated system for protein PTM network discovery with several unique features: (i) rich up-to-date integrated PTM information from the scientific literature and knowledgebases; (ii) representation of PTM proteins, PTM enzymes and their relations at the proteoform level; (iii) score for the quality of the underlying data; (iv) network visualization of PTM enzymesubstrate-site and PPI relations and (v) sequence alignment visualization of singly-modified, multiply-modified and/or overlapping PTM forms/sites within and across species. iPTMnet connects PTM proteoforms with their modifying enzymes and multiple coordinated PTMs across taxa, thereby unifying fragmented PTM information into a biologically meaningful context for visual and systematic PTM knowledge discovery.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

iPTMnet employs an integrative bioinformatics framework (Figure 1) to connect information from disparate bioinformatics databases, text mining results and ontologies into PTM networks for exploration and discovery. The main system components are: (i) a text mining system (see 2.1); (ii) PTM information from expert curated databases (see 2.2); (iii) Protein Ontology for proteoform representation within and across species (see 2.3) and (iv) iPTMnet knowledgebase and web portal (see 2.6). Overall, iPTMnet provides information on eight important types of PTM––phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation, methylation, glycosylation, S-nitrosylation, sumoylation and myristoylation––in human and several model organisms.  

# Full-Scale text mining of PTM information from literature  

We have established an automated workflow for full-scale processing of all PubMed abstracts and full length articles of the PubMed Central Open Access set (PMCOA) with RLIMS-P and eFIP, which have been previously evaluated for performance and usability in community challenges $(21-$ 24). The text mining results are stored in a local database and updated on a monthly basis. The information stored includes both entities (e.g. substrate, site and interactant) and relations (e.g., kinase-substrate-site and PPI) along with the corresponding evidence in text (e.g. sentences, section IDs and PubMed IDs (PMIDs)). The annotated text is tagged with key terms for evidence attribution. In the case of the full text, we only use information extracted from the results section to increase the likelihood that the information is supported by experimental evidence in the article. To integrate the text mining results into iPTMnet, we use PubTator (25) which retrieves NCBI gene IDs linked to the protein/gene mentions.  

# PTM information from curated databases  

iPTMnet integrates PTM information from several expert curated resources covering both low- and high-throughput data from a range of organisms: (i) PhosphoSitePlus (PSP): expert curated PTM information including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, acetylation and methylation mainly for human, rat and mouse proteins (6); (ii) Phospho.ELM: expert curated database for phosphorylation sites in animal proteins (11); (iii) PhosPhAt: protein phosphorylation sites identified by mass spectrometry in Arabidopsis thaliana; (iv) PhosphoGrid: experimentally verified in vivo protein phosphorylation sites in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (26); (v) PomBase: a comprehensive database for the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, providing structural and functional annotation, literature curation and access to largescale data sets (17); (vi) UniProtKB: comprehensive protein database in which the reviewed section contains expert annotated information from the literature, including PTM sequence features (27); (vii) P3DB: protein phosphorylation data from multiple plants derived from large-scale experiments and the literature (14); (viii) neXtProt: a human protein knowledgebase (16) with curated proteomics and genetic variation data, particularly on kinases; ix) HPRD: PTMs and enzyme-substrate relationships for human proteins (28); (x) Signor: a database of causal relationships between biological entities, including PTM-enzyme substrate relations (29) and (xi) dbSNO: a database that integrates the experimentally verified cysteine S-nitrosylation sites from multiple species (30). Some of these databases are no longer actively curating new papers. By including them in iPTMnet, we can preserve and disseminate their valuable contribution. We maintain the integrity of this data through site/sequence validity checks and monitoring for retracted articles so that we can correct or remove information as necessary.  

# Organization of proteins and PTM proteoforms using PRO  

PRO constitutes a crucial part of the iPTMnet dataset as it places the PTM site information in the context of proteoforms, i.e. it shows the combination of PTMs that have been observed in a given protein. This feature of representing experimentally validated combinations of PTMs is unique. PRO uses a hierarchical representation (family $\rightarrow$ gene $\rightarrow$ sequence $\rightarrow$ modification) that depicts the relationships of a protein to its parent class and child isoforms and proteoforms. The PRO hierarchy also connects the specific proteoform of a protein across taxa when a similar modification of the conserved protein is experimentally observed in multiple organisms. Moreover, PRO provides abundant expert-curated PTM enzyme-substrate and PTMdependent PPI relations.  

All PRO data are stored in a separate database, only part of which is consumed by iPTMnet. Descriptive information for each PRO entry such as name, definition and label are pulled out directly from the PRO database. PTM, PPI, and PRO hierarchical relationships are extracted and reformatted before being imported into iPTMnet, as follows: (i) For organism-specific PTM proteoforms (PRO category: organism-modification), we extract the evidence, reference UniProtKB AC and PTM sites along with their corresponding PTM types (represented by a PSI-MOD (31) or UniCarbKB (9) identifier) from the definition of the term. PTM enzyme information is extracted from the PRO comment line; (ii) Proteoform-dependent PPI information is extracted from the PRO annotation file. Annotations with evidence code ‘IPI’ (Inferred from physical interaction) or under the branch of ‘protein binding’ are extracted with the documented interaction partner; and iii) two types of hierarchical relations are extracted: is a (parent-child relationship) and intersection of (usually used to connect a proteoform with the organism it is found in).

# ID mapping for data integration  

Protein/gene entries are represented in the underlying iPTMnet data sources using various names and database identifiers such as UniProtKB ACs, NCBI gene IDs, NCBI RefSeq IDs and gene symbols. We use the UniProt Protein ID and gene name mapping tools (32) to map all proteins from the source data to UniProtKB ACs. In the case of oneto-many mapping, UniProtKB/SwissProt entry is selected over TrEMBL entries to minimize redundancy. When PTM information is available from the source database at the protein isoform level, we map to the corresponding UniProtKB isoform identifier (e.g. Q15796–2 for human SMAD2, isoform 2).  

# Confidence scoring of the PTM information  

The quality of each piece of PTM information (e.g. a specific PTM site or PTM kinase-site relation) depends on the underlying source databases and the experimental evidence from the literature. For the latter, we consider publications as “large-scale” (LSP) if they provide information for more than 10 proteins as these papers are more likely to be reporting high throughput studies.  

The confidence score (S) for each PTM information is calculated as:  

$$
\mathrm{\bfS=Sq+Sn+Sp,}
$$  

where Sq weights the quality of the underlying resource, Sn gives weight to multiple sources, and Sp gives weight to the number of publications, i.e.  

$\mathrm{Sq}=\left\{{2\atop1},\right.$ data from curated resources which curation policy ensure correct species assignment, data from other curated resources, data from automatic text mining;   
$\mathrm{Sn}=\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{1,}&{\mathrm{datafrommultipleresources},}\\ {0,}&{\mathrm{datafromsingleresource};}\end{array}\right.$   
${\mathrm{Sp}}={\left\{\begin{array}{l l}{1,}\\ {~0,}\\ {-1,}\end{array}\right.}$ data supported by multiple papers and at least one is not considered a LSP, data supported by one non LSP paper, only LSP or no literature evidence.  

The score ranges from 0 to 4, with 4 the highest confidence data. (Note we do not integrate the results from automatic text mining that are only supported by LSP.) In the iPTMnet website, the score is represented by the number of gold stars displayed next to a result.  

# iPTMnet knowledgebase and web portal  

We integrate text mining results, ontology and PTM database information into the iPTMnet knowledgebase. Implemented using Oracle (12c release 1), the database is designed as a dimensional model to support data retrieval and visualization. We perform integrity checks to ensure the quality of both the text mining results and database information. We verify kinase information by checking that its corresponding UniProtKB entry is annotated with the keyword ‘kinase.’ This approach is also used for other PTM enzyme types. We confirm that the assigned PTM types conform to their known residue types. PTM sites are further checked to ensure that the PTM residue is found at the expected position in the UniProtKB protein sequence of the substrate.  

The front-end website is built using Django (www. djangoproject.com), a high-level Python Web Framework, which links the underlying system components to support interactive scientific queries and visualization of PTM data. The website provides two types of visualization: the Cytoscape (33) network view, implemented with the Cytoscape.js (version 2.4.2) graph theory library, and the multiple sequence alignment view. Multiple sequence alignments are performed using MUSCLE (34).  

# RESULTS  

# iPTMnet knowledgebase content and web dissemination  

The current release of iPTMnet knowledgebase (Release 4.1, August 2017) consists of more than $654~500$ unique PTM sites in 62 100 modified proteins, along with 1200 PTM enzymes (see statistics in http://research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/iptmnet/stat).  

There are about $12700$ distinct enzyme-substrate pairs, $24~300$ distinct enzyme-substrate-site combinations, 1470 PTM-dependent PPIs, and 30 500 publications that describe one or more PTM and/or PPI relations. The top organisms represented are human, mouse, rat and Arabidopsis, and the top PTM types are phosphorylation, ubiquitination and acetylation. In terms of the data quality, the distribution of the confidence scores is $1.8\%$ , $2\%$ , $14.9\%$ , $73.7\%$ and $7.6\%$ for scores from 4 (highest confidence) to 0 (lowest confidence), respectively.  

The automatic text mining brings valuable data to iPTMnet as it can systematically process recent publications keeping iPTMnet up-to-date. RLIMS-P constitutes an evidence source for low-throughput experiments. For example, for TIF5A in maize (http://research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/ iptmnet/entry/P80639/#asSub), the phosphorylation information for S2 and S4 from P3DB source is from a largescale paper ‘Large-scale analysis of phosphorylated proteins in maize leaf’ (35), while RLIMS-P provides additional support for Ser2 phosphorylation from a lowthroughput experiment from the article ‘Phosphorylation of maize eukaryotic translation initiation factor on Ser2 by catalytic subunit CK2’ (36). Overall, there are ${\sim}6700$ sites in iPTMnet supported by multiple sources, where RLIMS$\mathrm{\bfP}$ provides the only low-throughput evidence. Finally, RLIMS-P also provides phosphorylation data for proteins not yet curated by other sources (e.g. phosphorylation of S281 in Rtn4r, http://research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/ iptmnet/entry/Q99M75/). Although RLIMS-P has been thoroughly evaluated previously, we evaluated its performance in the context of iPTMnet. We randomly selected 200 iPTMnet phosphorylation sites with RLIMS-P as an evidence source, and manually checked if the substrates and sites were correctly extracted. In this set, there were 19 results with errors (wrong substrates or sites), representing $<10\%$ , which is an error rate expected from automatic text mining. Note that the set where RLIMS-P is the unique source of evidence is more enriched for false positive results (error rate $=19\%$ in a test of 100 randomly selected results); this set is a priority to be reviewed and corrected by iPTMnet curators. In our confidence score system, we assign results from RLIMS-P only zero stars (see section 2.5) to indicate that they are not manually curated and provide a direct link to the text evidence for easy checking.  

We have developed a web portal (http://www. proteininformationresource.org/iPTMnet/) on the Protein Information Resource (PIR) website, allowing users to freely access the iPTMnet data. The iPTMnet website has received more than 6 million hits from $>16\ 000$ unique IPs in the first half of 2017.  

# iPTMnet website  

The iPTMnet website provides functionalities to address a variety of scientific questions. We describe below some of these functionalities along with examples. More examples can be found in (37) and in the iPTMnet on-line tutorial (http://research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/iptmnet/static/ iptmnet/files/iPTMnet Help.pdf).  

Search and Browse Functionality. iPTMnet can be queried using UniProtKB AC/ID, protein or gene name, PRO ID, and PMID (Figure 2A). The search can be restricted by PTM type, enzyme or substrate role, and/or organism. The search results page returns candidate entries matching the query (matched text/ID is highlighted, Figure 2B), ordered by the overall count of all PTM data in descending order. The browse page allows the user to view entries of interest using several filters (e.g. taxon, PTM type, and role).  

Batch retrieval. This function allows users to obtain PTM enzyme or PTM dependent PPI information for up to 500 PTM sites at a time (Figure 3). A link to the batch retrieval page is provided on the iPTMnet home page (Figure 3A). This functionality can assist, for example, in connecting PTM sites identified in phosphoproteomic experiments to kinase signaling pathways. For example, we obtained kinase information for 243 phosphorylation sites that were down-regulated by treatment of lung cancer cells with the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib ((4), Figure 3, Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). We retrieved 118 kinase-site pairs, with at least one kinase for 50 $(20\%)$ of the sites. These kinases belong to several pathways known to be regulated by EGFR, including PI3K/AKT/mTOR, PLCgamma/DAG/PKC and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK.  

Entry report page. Clicking on an entry in the search or browse results displays the Entry Report Page for the protein. All of the data tables in the entry page are searchable and filterable. The full report (e.g.http: //research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/iptmnet/entry/P31749) includes the following sections: (i) protein information from UniProt and PRO; (ii) sequence viewer with all modification sites color-coded and with link to alignment of orthologous proteoforms; (ii) substrate table indicating all PTM sites, PTM enzymes, sources and confidence score; an optional expanded view displays more detailed information about the PTM enzymes for each site and lower-confidence (zero star) results; (iii) PTM enzyme table with substrate

Figure 2. iPTMnet protein search interface. (A) The protein search interface allows users to search for proteins by name, accession numbers or PMID. Options to restrict search based on PTM type, role and organism are available. (B) The search results page displays matching results with the search terms highlighted in yellow.

list when applicable; (iv) proteoform table with proteoform information from PRO; (v) PTM-dependent PPI table with phosphorylated sites that affect PPI (automatically extracted using text mining tools) and (vi) proteoformPPI table with manually curated PPIs involving PTM. Because of their potential importance in PTM cross-talk, iPTMnet highlights sites that are targets of multiple PTMs: the sequence viewer displays residues that have multiple modifications with a distinct color (yellow, Figure 4A) and the substrate table can be filtered to show only these sites (Figure 4B). For example, T58 of MYC (http: //research.bioinformatics.udel.edu/iptmnet/entry/P01106/) undergoes mutually exclusive O-glycosylation and phosphorylation; these modifications are known to lead to different functional outcomes (38).  

Interactive sequence alignment viewer. The viewer, accessible via the entry report, allows comparison of PTMs and proteoforms across species. Very often the experimental information for PTMs in a given protein is spread over a set of related organisms, and comparing information across species can provide a more complete view of PTMs, proteoforms, and their properties. For example, the sequence alignment view of MARK2, which is a Ser/Thr protein kinase involved in cell polarity, indicates that information for PTMs exists in human, mouse and rat (Figure 5A). By inspecting the alignment, one can see that there is experimental evidence for phosphorylation of T208, an activating site (39) (magenta arrowhead pointing downward), and T596 and S212, two inhibitory sites (40,41) (magenta arrowheads pointing upwards), in all three mammalian species. The Oglycosylation (green arrowhead) and ubiquitination (blue arrowhead) sites in mouse are conserved in the orthologous sequences. More interestingly, as shown in the phosphodependent PPI table of the human MARK2 (Figure 5B), phosphorylation of S400 has a positive impact on the association with 14-3-3 proteins. By going to the source, eFIP, we can review the text evidence for the interaction where we find that 14-3-3 negatively regulates membrane association. The mouse residue is conserved (Figure 5A, black box) and also has been shown to be phosphorylated, suggesting that it could be interesting to experimentally test whether the PTM-regulated association with 14-3-3 proteins also occurs in mouse.  

Cytoscape network view. This view displays PTM sites and proteoforms as nodes, and PTM-enzyme-site, proteoformsite and PPI relationships as edges. This visualization is useful for identifying sites targeted by multiple PTM enzymes, which could be important for pathway crosstalk and PTM-dependent PPIs. Users can view the entire network for a protein or build a custom network by checking the boxes next to relations of interest in the entry and batch retrieval pages. The Cytoscape network view can provide insight into the conservation and variety of site modifications and proteoforms. For example, MYOD1, a transcriptional activator that promotes transcription of muscle-specific target genes and plays a role in muscle differentiation, has three PTM proteoforms in mouse (Figure 6). One of them, mMYOD1pS5, pS200 (PR:000029162), is phosphorylated at S5 and S200 by CDK1, decreasing MYOD1 stability (42). This doubly phosphorylated proteoform has not been described in humans. However, the iPTMnet network view shows that both S5 and S200 have been shown to be phosphorylated in human by CDK1; therefore, we can infer the existence of hMYOD1pS5, pS200, the down-regulated proteoform of MYOD1, in human (shown as a yellow node with dashed arrows in Figure 6).

Figure 3. iPTMnet batch retrieval. (A) The batch retrieval tool can be accessed via a link under the search box (green circle). (B) The batch retrieval interface. Sites can be entered into the input box in a three column format––substrate AC, site residue, site position––or uploaded as a text file. The user can select to view either PTM enzymes or PTM-dependent PPIs. (D) Batch retrieval results showing some of the PTM enzymes for a set of 243 phosphorylation sites that are regulated by EGFR and the EGFR inhibitor, erlotinib. (E) Batch retrieval results showing some of the EGFR/erlotinib regulated sites that do not have PTM enzyme information.  

PMID report page. Searching for a PMID opens the corresponding PMID Report Page. This page displays the title and abstract of the article followed by tables that display all of the PTM and PPI information in the iPTMnet that is derived from that article. This page serves as a point for  

Europe PubMed Central to link to the iPTMnet data via its external link tab (e.g., http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/ 19011111?fromSearch $\c=$ singleResult).  

# DISCUSSION  

In this work, we have described iPTMnet, a resource for PTM knowledge discovery that integrates information from the scientific literature, PTM databases, and biological ontologies, and illustrated its use through several scientific scenarios. iPTMnet has a number of key features that distinguish it from other PTM resources. These include: (i) an emphasis on experimentally validated PTM enzyme-substratesite relations; (ii) representation of PTM proteoforms modified on combinations of sites, which can provide insight into PTM competition; (iii) information on the impact of PTM on protein function, specifically the effects of phosphorylation on PPI; and iv) alignment of orthologous proteoforms, enabling comparison of PTM proteoforms across species and prediction of PTM sites and proteoforms for proteins where experimental evidence is lacking.

Figure 6. iPTMnet Network View for human and mouse MYOD1. The Cytoscape-based network view shows MYOD1 protein/proteoforms-PTM site (grey edges) and PTM enzyme-PTM site relationships (pink edges). The yellow node is a human proteoform that can be inferred based on the mouse proteoform, given that both sites and kinase involved are conserved (node added manually). To facilitate view, many other PTM nodes and edges have been hidden.  

Currently, iPTMnet presents text mining results for substrates and phosphorylation sites from all PubMed abstracts and the results sections of the PMCOA collection. One of the most challenging text mining tasks is gene/protein name normalization (linking protein names with database identifiers). In the current version of iPTMnet, we only integrate text mining results that have been normalized with high confidence; consequently, only a fraction of the automated results are displayed. We are improving the interface to allow users to seamlessly view the complete text mining results for a protein of interest and to integrate these results into the network view.  

Other future work involves expanding the search capabilities to enable more complex queries such as: (i) retrieval of the most relevant set of substrates and enzymes given a particular PubMed-like keyword query (e.g. Alzheimer’s disease); (ii) retrieval of all entries that exhibit a specified type of PTM competition (e.g. between acetylation and ubiquitination on a single site) or iii) retrieval of all entries in which PTM results in a specified functional impact (e.g. PTMdependent PPI). We will also provide RESTful web services for the users to access the data programmatically.  

In conclusion, we have shown that iPTMnet serves as a gateway for biologists to search, browse, visualize and explore PTM networks. The integrated text mining and data mining in an ontological framework connects the knowledge about the biologically relevant modified proteins from disparate data sources and the corresponding data representation enables discovery and hypothesis generation.

# Introduction  

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the primary cause of illness and death globally, resulting in 17.8 million deaths in 2017, a $21.1\%$ increase from 2007 to 2017 (1 . The number reached 20.5 million in 2021 (2 . CVD includes a range of disorders affecting the heart and blood vessels, such as coronary artery disease CAD) and stroke. Various omics studies on CVD have revealed some important genes associated with the disease.  

For example, a comprehensive gene-centric association study identified our genetic variants inked o myocardial nfarction (3 . RNA-seq analysis and network construction pinpointed lncRNA SNHG8 as a risk factor for acute myocardial infarction, supported by RT-PCR for its diagnostic value (4 . n addition, methylation of he PTEN promoter was ound o be nvolved in cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM), a type of vascular lesion in the central nervous system (5 . A proteomic study also suggested that LRP2 and SZT2 may play a role in CVD (6 . An untargeted metabolomic study on coronary heart disease (CHD) identified four lipid-related metabolites with a causal role n CHD 7 . These research findings, encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, offer a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying CVD. Furthermore, significant research efforts have been made to identify CVDrelated raits, such as blood ipid evels, blood pressure, and nflammatory markers, through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to elucidate the genetic loci associated with these risk factors for CVD (8–10 .  

The advancement of sequencing technology has provided valuable insights into the mechanisms and molecular signatures of cardiovascular disease CVD). As a result, here s now an abundance of CVD-related data and knowledge available. To better understand the biological characteristics of CVD, it is crucial to develop integrated and organized multi-omics databases. These databases are designed to provide a comprehensive view of the complex biological processes underlying CVD, including CaGE (11 , CADgene (12 , CardioGenBase (13  and C/VDdb (14 . CaGE is a knowledgebase of cardiac gene expression, presenting 7,188 unique Human LocusLink identifiers expressed in human normal or dilated cardiomyopathic failing cardiac tissue. CADgene provides evidence related to coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction, with nformation on more han 300 candidate genes rom over 1,300 publications of genetic studies. CardioGenBase uses a text mining approach o collect gene-disease associations, containing about $1{,}500\ \mathrm{CVD}$ genes and 24,000 research articles on six major CVDs. C/VDdb is an integrated multi-omics information resource of CVD, consisting of 4,353 unique molecule entries collected from nearly 100 manually curated studies. However, these existing databases for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have some limitations. Firstly, hese databases often only focus on a narrow range of CVD disorders, neglecting others requiring comprehensive characterization. Secondly, the abundant omics data urgently calls for unified analysis, improved integration, and visualization to unlock their full potential and gain comprehensive insights. Thirdly, prior knowledge from other published databases must be utilized more effectively Lastly continuously updating or making these databases readily available is crucial.  

To tackle these issues, we have developed CVD Atlas, a comprehensive database for cardiovascular disease. CVD Atlas includes manually curated gene–disease associations, analysis results from human multi-omics datasets and prior knowledge from existing databases. Furthermore, t boasts an interactive, information-rich knowledge graph and provides two types of analysis tools. CVD Atlas offers the latest integrated multi-omics resources for cardiovascular disease research. Consequently, we believe that CVD Atlas will significantly support cardiovascular disease research and clinical practice.  

# Materials and methods  

# Data curation and integration  

Our process began with a comprehensive literature search in NCBI PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ . We used predefined keywords such as ‘(Cardiovascular disease) AND (GWAS)’, ‘(Cardiovascular disease) AND (Transcriptome)’ and (Cardiovascular disease) AND Methylation)’. We then reviewed the articles rigorously, ensuring that only the most relevant and high-quality publications were included. Subsequently, we manually curated the study information from each relevant publication, a step that underscores the human expertise and judgment involved in the process. We selected only associations reported at significant levels $P_{\l}$ value $<0.05$ or adjusted $P$ value $<0.05)$ ) for inclusion in CVD Atlas. To create a more comprehensive database, we also reviewed and integrated prior knowledge from existing databases such as PedAM 15 , TWAS Atlas 16 , HMDD $\mathrm{v}4.0$ (17 , miRNASNP-v3 (18 , CTD (19 , PharmGKB (20  and RNADisease $\mathrm{v}4.0$ (21 .  

# Multi-omics data collection and processing  

We obtained GWAS summary statistics or cardiovascular disease (CVD) from the GWAS Catalog (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ gwas/) (22 . We processed the raw data using MungeSumstats v1.10.1 (23  to ensure consistency with the reference genome GRCh38 (hg38). We conducted various quality control steps such as filling in missing SNP IDs, chromosome (CHR), base pair position (BP), and statistical values like effect size (Beta), standard error (SE), odds ratio (OR) and $P$ value using available data. We then used a $P$ value threshold of 5.0E-8 to identify significant SNPs. If no SNPs reached the genome-wide significance level in a GWAS dataset, we defined a genetic locus using the suggestive $P$ value threshold of 1.0E-4. For fine-mapping, we performed colocalization analysis using the R package coloc v5.2.2 (24 , integrating GWAS and eQTL data rom 49 issues n GTEx v8 https://gtexportal.org/  25 . We defined genetic loci as 1 MB windows around lead SNPs with the smallest $P$ value and used recommended thresholds $(\mathrm{PP4}~\geq~0.75$ and $\mathrm{PP}4/\mathrm{PP}3\ \geq\ 3$ ) to establish causal gene associations.  

For transcriptomics, we collected microarray and RNAsequencing (RNA-seq) data from the GEO database (https: //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/  (26 27 . The gene expression profiles of the microarray data were obtained using the advanced R package GEOquery (28 . We performed normalization and differential expression analysis using the powerful R package limma (29 . The bulk RNA-seq data were downloaded, and we used the state-of-the-art tools fastp $\mathbf{v}0.20.0$ (30 , STAR v2.7.6a (31  and RSEM v1.3.1 (32  for quality control, read alignment, and estimation of gene expression levels, respectively. We utilized DESeq2 v1.38.3 33  or differential expression analysis, identifying differentially expressed genes based on $|\mathrm{log}_{2}\mathrm{FC}|\geq1$ and adjusted $P$ value $<0.05$ . GO enrichment and co-expression analyses were performed using the R packages clusterProfiler v3.18.0 (34  and WGCNA v1.70-3 (35 , respectively.  

We obtained beta-value matrices or methylation data rom the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450K) from GEO. Then, we used the R package ChAMP v2.32.0 (36–38 to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs). DMPs with delta beta| $\ge0.2$ and adjusted $P$ value $<0.05$ were considered significant.  

For proteomics, we downloaded protein expression profiles rom PRIDE https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/  39 and conducted the differential expression analysis using the R package DEP v1.12.0 (40 . We considered proteins with |average $\mathrm{log}_{2}\mathrm{FCl}\geq1$ and $P$ value $<0.05$ as significantly differentially expressed proteins.  

For metabolomics, we carefully selected metabolomic datasets from the Metabolomics Workbench (https://www. metabolomicsworkbench.org/) (41  and performed the differential analysis using the R package MetaboAnalystR $\mathrm{v}4.0.0$ (42 . This rigorous selection process ensures the high quality and reliability of our data. We identified differential metabolites with a variable importance projection (VIP) score $\geq1$ using Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA).  

# Ontology mapping and standardizing  

To standardize disease and trait names, we employed diseaserelated terms and identifiers from various ontologies, such as the Disease Ontology (DO, https://disease-ontology.org/ , Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ efo/), Medical Subject Headings MeSH, https://www.nlm.nih. gov/mesh/meshhome.html , and MONDO (https://mondo. monarchinitiative.org/). Utilizing these ontologies, we organized diseases and traits into eight and five distinct subcategories, respectively.  

# Knowledge graph construction  

We have recently built a knowledge graph o mprove he visualization and understanding of connections. This graph identifies three main entities: disease, trait and gene. The graph consists of three main sections: ‘Disease network’, ‘Trait network’ and ‘Gene network’ each centered around its respective core entity. We calculated a confidence score for each diseasegene or trait-gene association based on multi-omics evidence to provide a deeper understanding. This score is included in the graph as an additional attribute, indicating the strength and reliability of each connection.  

# Enrichment analysis and signature comparison  

The current version of CVD Atlas ncludes wo ools: Enrichment analysis’ and ‘Signature comparison’. The ‘Enrichment analysis’ tool determines gene function based on the gene– disease or gene–trait perspective, using all genes in the repository as a reference set. Users can submit a list of gene symbols, set conditions, and calculate the significance $P$ value using Fisher’s exact est. The Signature comparison’ ool allows users o compare user-submitted signatures with differentially expressed genes from each dataset in CVD Atlas.  

# Database implementation  

CVD Atlas was developed using SpringBoot (https://spring. io/projects/spring-boot  and MyBatis (https://mybatis.org/ mybatis-3  as the back-end framework. The web interface was built using HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), jQuery (https://jquery.com , AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) and Thymeleaf (https: //www.thymeleaf.org . Front-end frameworks such as Semantic UI (https://semantic-ui.com  and Bootstrap (https:// getbootstrap.com  were also employed. Data were stored and queried using MySQL (https://www.mysql.com , and visualization was achieved through Apache ECharts (http://echarts. apache.org .  

# Database contents and usage  

CVD Atlas is a comprehensive database created through meticulous manual curation, analysis of multi-omics datasets and integration of knowledge from existing databases. Additionally, the website includes a visual and interactive knowledge graph and two types of tools to facilitate a better understanding of the intricate relationships between genes and CVD (Figure 1A).  

# Integration of multi-omics association knowledge for cardiovascular disease  

In he current version, CVD Atlas houses 215,333 associations from 308 publications, 652 datasets and 7 existing databases. These encompass 35,829 genes, 190 diseases grouped into 8 categories, and 44 traits classified into 5 categories (Figure 1B, C). Among these genes, the most prevalent are proteincoding genes, ollowed by ncRNA Supplementary Figure S1 . Most genes are linked to multiple diseases or traits, with a median association of four diseases or traits per gene. The top 20 genes with the highest number of associated diseases or traits exhibit various functions across different conditions (Figure 1D). hsa-mir-146a is the most prominent gene associated with 55 diseases, while BRAP HECTD4 and NAA25 are the leading genes linked to 19 traits. Conversely, the median number of related genes for 190 diseases and 44 traits is 86 and 234, respectively. The top 10 diseases and traits with the most associated genes are shown in Figure 1E. Hypertension is associated with 836 high-quality genes with a confidence score greater than 0.7. This indicates its complex pathological mechanisms and molecular functions. AGT  NOS3  POMC ADRB1 and NPPA are the top genes associated with hypertension, ranked by their confidence scores. AGT gene encodes angiotensinogen, the sole precursor of all angiotensin peptides, playing a vital role in regulating blood pressure (43 . The associations between AGT polymorphism and hypertension have been well-documented (44–46 . NOS3 encodes one of the three isoforms of nitric oxide synthase, primarily found in endothelial cells, and is essential for vascular health. NOS3 is also recognized as a genetic risk factor for hypertension (47 48 . Additionally, the CVD Atlas contains 457,286 SNPs, 8,436 differentially methylated positions, 453 differentially expressed proteins and 148 differentially expressed metabolites.  

# User-friendly modules for accessing data  

The ‘Browse’ page of CVD Atlas contains seven interactive tables that are easy to navigate. Each table is indexed by disease, trait, dataset, gene, SNP, association and publication, allowing users to access relevant data easily. The browse tables provide basic information and brief summarized statistics. For example, the ‘Disease browse’ table displays all the diseases included in CVD Atlas, along with their names, CVD Atlas IDs and statistics such as significant SNPs, colocalized genes, differentially expressed genes, proteins, metabolites, differentially methylated positions, associated chemicals, other associations and datasets. Users can access detailed information on each item by visiting its dedicated page, which provides comprehensive information on all associations across different omics levels (Figure 2A).  

To facilitate efficient querying, CVD Atlas offers several search channels: (i) a quick search box on the home page for real-time queries by specifying disease name, trait name, gene name, SNP, or CVD Atlas ID; (ii) an advanced search function on the ‘Search’ page that allows users to access CVD Atlas using specific terms related to genes (e.g. gene symbol), diseases or traits (e.g. disease or trait name), SNPs (e.g. dbSNP ID 49 ) and datasets e.g. GEO D). The advanced search also enables users to search for genes, SNPs, or datasets associated with a specific disease or rait and o query diseases related o a specific gene (Figure 2B). Furthermore, CVD Atlas features an auto-suggestion function that provides candidate query terms for users based on even short inputs.

# Highly integrated knowledge graph with interactive visualization  

To improve the integration and visualization of information, CVD Atlas creates a comprehensive and interactive knowledge graph by systematically combining disease-gene and trait–gene associations (Figure 2C). The graph consists of three panels: ‘Disease network’, ‘Trait network’ and ‘Gene network’. t defines three types of entities: diseases, raits and genes. Each panel highlights the respective entity as core nodes. The connections are quantitatively characterized by a confidence scoring system based on multi-omics associations and represented by the distance between two nodes. By default, only the top 20 associated entities are displayed and sorted in descending order by confidence score. Moreover, all nodes in the graph can be moved, allowing users to customize the display and export the high-resolution graph. For example, in the ‘Disease network’ for coronary artery disease, the graph displays the top 20 genes related to CAD by default, such as PHACTR1 and NOS3  Notably, PHACTR1 is the most related gene, as it is the nearest node to CAD, with a confidence score of 0.965. The graph lets users access detailed information about each node by clicking on them.

# Analysis tools for efficient data exploration  

We have implemented two tools, ‘Enrichment analysis’ and ‘Signature comparison’, in CVD Atlas to make it easy and efficient o explore he database. The first ool helps users determine f specific genes play a role n certain diseases or raits by examining which diseases or traits are enriched by the genes of interest. Users can submit a list of genes under specified conditions to calculate the $P$ value using Fisher’s exact test. The ‘Enrichment analysis’ output includes a table for genes matched in CVD Atlas, a dot plot, and a detailed table of enrichment results Figure 2D). The second ool helps users dentify the relevant diseases for user-submitted gene signatures across datasets by assessing the overlap between the submitted gene ist and he differentially expressed genes or diseases in each dataset. The Signature comparison’ output consists of a network graph showing he relationships between genes, diseases, and datasets, along with two tables detailing the number of gene hits per disease and he differential analysis results (Figure 2E).  

# Case study: coronary artery disease  

CVD Atlas contains comprehensive nformation about cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its functional modules. To illustrate, let’s look at how CVD Atlas is used to explore coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD is a cardiovascular disorder characterized by the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries. There are 79,724 entries related to CAD within CVD  

Atlas across all six omics levels. CAD is linked with 3,279 genes, with 379 genes associated with CAD in at least two omics levels. The detailed information about CAD is divided into six panels: ‘Basic information’, ‘Genomics’, ‘Transcriptomics’, Epigenomics’, Proteomics’ and ‘Chemical’. The ‘Basic information’ panel provides fundamental details about CAD, such as the disease name, CVD Atlas ID, MeSH ID, ontology ID and a description. A confidence score presents an overview of the associations between genes and CAD. The top five genes associated with CAD are PHACTR1  NOS3  LPA PCSK9 and SORT1 Supplementary Figure S2 . Taking NOS3 as an example, it is linked to CAD across three omics levels: genomics, transcriptomics, and chemicals. This association is supported by 598 entries, covering 43 publications and two datasets. This strongly underscores that the integrated data provided by CVD Atlas offers users multidimensional nsights into the connection between specific genes and diseases from different angles.  

CVD Atlas provides six other panels to offer a comprehensive view. In the ‘Genomics’ panel, five GWAS datasets (four European and one mixed ancestry) were included. Among them, rs7412, a missense variant of APOE  has the highest number of significant datasets in the European population (Supplementary Figure S3 , suggesting its potential importance or CAD. Colocalization analysis of GWAS and coronary artery eQTL data indicates that PHACTR1  MRAS and LINC00881 might be strong causal candidates for CAD in the European population (Supplementary Figure S4 . These genes are closely associated with CAD and other cardiovascular diseases (50–54 . The ‘Transcriptomics’ panel displays differentially expressed genes collected from dataset analysis and manual curation. For example, JUN  NR4A1 and TNFAIP3 are significantly differentially expressed in three of ten datasets Supplementary Figure S5 . These genes have close relationships with human malignancies (55–59 . Recent studies reported that CAD and cancer often co-occur via common biological pathways and shared risk actors. Various chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy can impact the development and progression of CAD (60 . In the ‘Epigenomics’ panel, no differentially methylated positions are recorded in the current version of CVD Atlas. Moreover, associations at different omics levels collected from existing databases and curated results are provided in these three panels. In the ‘Proteomics’ panel, IGFBP2  THY1 and APOH are the top positively related proteins, whereas S100A8  TGM3  and APOB are the top negatively associated proteins in CAD (Supplementary Table S1 . In the ‘Metabolomics’ panel, 49 differentially expressed metabolites are displayed. Among them, adenylosuccinic acid, 4a-carbinolamine tetrahydrobiopterin, and succinyladenosine are the top metabolites associated with CAD (Supplementary Table S2 . The associations of chemicals with diseases were presented in the ‘Chemical’ panel. For example, cocaine is the most closely related chemical, directly supported by 17 publications as the ‘Marker/Mechanism’ type in CTD. n comparison, aspirin s directly reported by eight publications as the ‘Therapeutic’ type (Supplementary Figure S6 . CVD Atlas contains comprehensive nformation about cardiovascular diseases and offers valuable insights for researchers on cardiovascular health.  

# Discussion and future developments  

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a significant health concern that has been extensively researched. Numerous studies have been conducted on CVD across different fields, including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics and metabolomics (61 62 . Existing CVD multi-omics resources offer a comprehensive perspective and valuable insights into CVD. However, ntegrating a arge number of associations and datasets remains a challenge. To address this issue, we introduce the CVD Atlas. CVD Atlas is an available database that systematically curates published disease-gene associations, analyzes multi-omics datasets, combines knowledge from existing databases, and implements a visualized and interactive knowledge graph and two analysis tools. Compared with the current CVD multi-omics databases, CVD Atlas offers he ollowing features: (i) comprehensive coverage of a wide range of cardiovascular diseases grouped by an ontology classification system and characterized by multi-omics annotations; ii) integration of analysis results rom diverse omics datasets processed through a unified pipeline, providing valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of diseases and (iii) aggregation of scattered knowledge from multiple existing databases to provide a more comprehensive understanding of CVD.  

CVD Atlas, a crucial resource within the National Genomics Data Center (NGDC, https://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn  (63 committed to continuous improvement, will be regularly updated to include the latest association discoveries and cardiovascular disease (CVD) datasets from various omics. The updates will expand the types of knowledge or datasets generated by different methods, ncluding additional evels of epigenomic knowledge like histone modification and chromatin accessibility (64 65 . Moreover, future updates will incorporate single-cell RNA sequencing scRNA-seq) and spatial ranscriptomics data to analyze cellular transcriptomic variability under different conditions of CVD (66 67 . The current version of CVD Atlas already includes one expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) dataset from GTEx, and future updates will integrate more types of QTLs while considering the impact of ancestry Additionally regulatory information on protein–protein nteraction, which s valuable or understanding the complex biological pathways and molecular mechanisms underlying CVD, will also be ncluded n uture updates. The aim is for CVD Atlas to become an essential resource, providing comprehensive and up-to-date knowledge on cardiovascular disease.

# ABSTRACT  

BreCAN-DB (http://brecandb.igib.res.in) is a repository cum browser of whole genome somatic DNA breakpoint profiles of cancer genomes, mapped at single nucleotide resolution using deep sequencing data. These breakpoints are associated with deletions, insertions, inversions, tandem duplications, translocations and a combination of these structural genomic alterations. The current release of BreCAN-DB features breakpoint profiles from 99 cancer-normal pairs, comprising five cancer types. We identified DNA breakpoints across genomes using high-coverage next-generation sequencing data obtained from TCGA and dbGaP. Further, in these cancer genomes, we methodically identified breakpoint hotspots which were significantly enriched with somatic structural alterations. To visualize the breakpoint profiles, a next-generation genome browser was integrated with BreCAN-DB. Moreover, we also included previously reported breakpoint profiles from 138 cancer-normal pairs, spanning 10 cancer types into the browser. Additionally, BreCAN-DB allows one to identify breakpoint hotspots in user uploaded data set. We have also included a functionality to query overlap of any breakpoint profile with regions of user’s interest. Users can download breakpoint profiles from the database or may submit their data to be integrated in BreCAN-DB. We believe that BreCAN-DB will be useful resource for genomics scientific community and is a step towards personalized cancer genomics.  

# INTRODUCTION  

It is widely understood that incidence of structural genomic alterations (GAs) is frequently associated with cancer and indeed has been posed as a prominent cause for acquisition of hallmarks of cancer initiation/progression (1,2). These GAs could be large-sized deletions, insertions, inversions, translocations, fusions and copy number variations (3–5). Studies indicate that GAs not only account for larger genomic heterogeneity in populations but may also have a much larger than anticipated impact on oncogenesis and cancer progression (6,7). Most studies so far have focused mainly upon association of mutations, especially nonsynonymous point mutations present in the coding regions of the genome. Results from such studies have shown that though certain point mutation events in cancer are more associated with specific genes like BRCA1 in breast cancer (8), TP53 in glioblastoma multiforme (9), such mutations are present in only a small percentage of disease cases (10). This has led to an increased interest in large-sized GAs (that may span from tens of bases to few megabases of genome) to better understand cancer etiology.  

Profiling GAs have been more challenging than profiling point mutations, mainly due to requirement of deep coverage genome sequence data and algorithms that can map sequence reads to identify breakpoints at single base resolution. With fulfilment of these requirements, various efforts to elucidate the role of GAs in cancer genome have been made. However, they were unable to include either large sample size, single base resolution or/and accessible data for individual breakpoint profile. With these features in mind, BreCAN-DB was developed to allow users navigate genomes for mining individualized single base resolution breakpoint events in a readily scalable setting.  

Recent studies involving meta-analysis of large-scale data sets have indicated the utility of integrating and methodologically making statistical analysis to gain biological insights; these span from analysis of structural variants at low resolution, gene expression and small RNA expression (11–13). Moreover, in last few years, various prominent resources have been developed such as COSMIC (14), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal (https://tcgadata.nci.nih.gov/tcga/), UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser (15) and International Cancer Genome consortium (ICGC) data portal (16), serving data related to genomic variations in cancer both as pooled datasets as well as at personalized level. Of these, COSMIC uses a gene-focused approach where most mutation data are available for genes nominated from Cancer Gene Census (17) while TCGA and ICGC provide genomic SNP and copy number profiles at personalized level. BreCAN-DB complements these databases by adopting an individual profile-based approach for largesized GAs over gene-based approach, so that information on low recurrence but potentially relevant events is retained. It is being increasingly appreciated to understand genome in a personalized context. Also, many of the genomic variations have already been associated with response to therapy while many others still remain elusive (18). Hence, it is crucial that each cancer’s structural variation is studied individually so that viable targets for precision therapy may be developed.  

To facilitate studies involving DNA breakpoints at personalized levels, we have made BreCAN-DB: ‘BREakpoint profiles of CANcer genomes DataBase’, a browsable repository of personalized cancer DNA breakpoint profiles mapped over the entire genomes of 99 cancer and matched control pairs from five cancer types viz. glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), breast invasive carcinoma (BRC), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HN). We also provide functionality of visualizing and comparing DNA breakpoint profiles between samples of same cancer type or across different cancer types using BreCAN-DB.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Implementation  

BreCAN-DB has been implemented in three phases: Phase 1- collection of whole genome sequencing data of cancer and matched normal tissues, Phase 2- mapping of somatic DNA breakpoint profiles and breakpoint hotspots and Phase 3- user interface development for interactive visualization through web browser. These three phases are described below.  

# Data collection  

To generate DNA breakpoint profiles, we retrieved the Illumina whole genome paired end sequencing reads from 99 cancer-normal pairs comprising five cancer types viz. 15 pairs of BRC from Banerji et. al (19), 27 pairs of GBM (9), 17 pairs of LUAD (20), 23 pairs of OV (21) and 17 pairs of HN (22) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (phase 1 of Figure 1A). Sequencing data for GBM, LUAD, OV and HN were downloaded in the BAM format (23), while data for BRC were downloaded in SRA (sequence read archive) format from the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (24) (dbGaP Study Accession: phs000369 and phs000178). The paired-end sequencing reads of BRC were aligned to the human reference genome (UCSC build hg19) using BWA aligner with default parameters to create BAM files (25). Further, we also incorporated data of 138 cancer genomes from Yang et al. where breakpoints were called on cancer genomes using Meerkat (26).  

# Mapping of breakpoint profiles  

Breakpoints of GAs were identified in all normal and cancer genomes independently using Meerkat with default parameters (26). The algorithm of Meerkat calls GAs at positions where cluster of read pairs are discordant and subsequently, the breakpoints of these GAs are precisely determined at single nucleotide resolution using soft-clipped reads. These GAs include insertions, deletions, intra and inter-chromosomal translocations, inversions, tandem duplications and combination of events. To reduce the number of false positives, we filtered GAs, supported by at least two discordant pairs and two soft-clipped reads (phase 2 of Figure 1A). GAs with size more than $10~\mathrm{Mb}$ were also filtered out to get a final list of high confidence GAs. GAs specifically present in only cancer genomes (somatic GAs) were identified by subtracting GAs of all normal genomes from each cancer genome using Meerkat. Further, these GAs were filtered using Database of Genomic Variants (27) to get list of only cancer-specific GAs.  

# Mapping of breakpoint hotspots  

To identify DNA breakpoint hotspots, we extended breakpoints of each cancer-specific GA by $10~\mathrm{\Kb}$ upstream and downstream (phase 2 of Figure 1A). Further, using boundaries of extended breakpoint regions from all cancer genomes, we segmented the reference genome into nonoverlapping bins of unequal sizes. The bins that overlapped with extended regions in more than one cancer genome were identified and their enrichment score was calculated as number of samples harbouring extended breakpoint regions overlapping with these bins. Next, we compared these scores with expected distribution of score calculated by randomizing the GAs of all samples 10000 times and calculated their significance. The bins with $P$ -value $<0.05$ after Bonferroni Hochberg correction for multiple hypothesis testing were finally selected as cancer breakpoint hotspots. Similar strategy was used to find breakpoint hotspots for all five types of cancer separately.  

# Development of web-accessible interface  

The interactive front end interface of database was designed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and made web-accessible through Apache2 HTTP server running on CentOS7 Linux platform (phase 3 of Figure 1A). The server is hosted at Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology and can be accessed at http://brecandb.igib.res.in. For visualization of breakpoint profiles in BreCAN-DB, these breakpoint profiles were converted to json format and integrated with JBrowse, an advanced, open source and JavaScript-based genome browser (28,29). JBrowse uses an approach where most feature rendering is done by the client machine rather than server, resulting in quick response to the user. Further, other modules to submit and download breakpoint profiles in BED format were implemented using PHP. The modules ‘Compare Breakpoint profiles’ to compare a new genomic profile against breakpoint profiles of database and ‘Map Breakpoint hotspots’ to map breakpoint enriched regions were implemented using BEDTools (30) and the former outputs sortable barplots, implemented using D3.js (31).  

# RESULTS  

# Database content and statistics  

BreCAN-DB is DataBase of personalized somatic DNA BREakpoint profiles of CANcer genome. The current version of the database comprises whole genome somatic breakpoint profiles of 99 cancer-normal pairs from five types of cancer obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas and dbGaP (19). The raw breakpoints were mapped at single nucleotide resolution in cancer genome deep sequencing data using Meerkat software (26), which were further filtered using GAs from corresponding cancer type pooled normal data and Database of Genomic variants (27) (see Methods; Figure 1A). These profiles were named as GBM profile1 to GBM profile27 for 27 breakpoint profiles of GBM, BRC profile1 to BRC profile15 for 15 BRC, LUAD profile1 to LUAD profile17 for 17 LUAD, OV profile1 to OV profile23 for $\bar{2}3\ \mathrm{OV}$ and HN profile1 to HN profile15 for $15\ \mathrm{\HN}$ as shown in Figure 1B. These DNA breakpoints correspond to large-sized deletions, tandem duplications, insertions, inversions, intra and inter-chromosomal translocations and combination of such events. A total of 1 92 626 breakpoints were identified with average number of 1945 breakpoints per cancer genome. Table 1 provides the number of breakpoints in different cancer genomes. Further, we have also mapped significant breakpoint hotspots in five different types of cancer, i.e. genomic regions with more number of observed DNA breakpoints in comparison to expected (see Methods; Figure 1A). BreCAN-DB also collates 4415 breakpoint hotspots distributed over the whole genome (see Table 2). Further, we included 138 whole genome breakpoint profiles from 10 cancer types mapped by Yang et al. (26). This data set included three cancer types already present in our analysis viz. breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA; $n=35$ ), glioblastoma multiforme (GBM; $n=16$ ) and ovarian serous cystadenocarcinoma (OV; $n=9$ ); beyond these it included seven other cancer types $\nu i z$ . colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRC; $n=14$ ), multiple myeloma (MM; $n=7$ ), prostrate adenocarcinoma (PR; $n=7$ ), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; $n=19$ ), lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC; $n=18$ ), uterine corpus endometrioid carcinoma (UCEC; $n=10$ ) and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC; $n=3$ ).  

Apart from serving as repository, we have included five modules in BreCAN-DB that help users analyse their own data with breakpoints present in the database. These five modules are ‘Breakpoint Profiles and hotspots browser’, ‘Map Breakpoint hotspots’, ‘Compare Breakpoint Profiles’, ‘Submit Breakpoint Profiles’, ‘Download Breakpoint Profiles’ (Figure 1C), these have been discussed further in the following sections.  

# Breakpoint Profiles and hotspots browser  

To visualize the distribution of DNA breakpoint profiles of cancer genomes, we provided a genome browser as shown in Figure 2A. The browser tracks have been divided into mainly three sections. Section 1 contains the tracks of human reference genome (assembly hg19), chromosome bands and Refseq genes downloaded from UCSC. Section 2 contains five tracks, each representing breakpoint hotspots (see Methods for details) for one type of cancer. Section 3 contains tracks of personalized whole genome breakpoint profiles, each representing breakpoint profile of a sample from particular cancer type. A separate tab was created in this section to include data from external sources (currently from Yang et al.).  

The views are available from chromosome level to nucleotide level. For better visualization, each DNA breakpoint in breakpoint profile tracks has been shown as rectangular bar representing a $20~\mathrm{Kb}$ region centralized at the breakpoint. Moreover, information on chromosome banding is also provided as separate track. Any of these tracks can be switched on or off by user for interactive visualization. The genomic sequence of hotspots and breakpoints can also be obtained by clicking on the respective feature. Also, we have annotated each breakpoint such that its associated genomic alteration type is directly visible to the user. It also allows user to upload breakpoint profiles in Browser Extensible (BED) format (a flexible format that allows features to be represented in form of genomic start and end coordinates) and visualize it along with one or more selected profiles already available in the database. In this way, user can directly compare whether the uploaded breakpoints overlap with his gene of interest or breakpoint hotspots or breakpoint profile of any of the five types of cancer.  

# Map breakpoint hotspots  

We also provide a module wherein user can submit DNA breakpoint profiles of multiple samples and obtain breakpoint hotspots, regions with breakpoints in more than given number of samples (Figure 2B). The breakpoint profiles in BED format must be zipped with one file per sample and uploaded to the module. These breakpoints should be provided at nucleotide base resolution as this module first extends each breakpoint by 10Kb upstream and downstream. Next, it divides the human genome into non-overlapping bins of unequal sizes using boundaries of extended regions and finds bins that overlap with more than threshold number (given by user) of samples. The output file contains genomic coordinates of breakpoint hotspots along with number of samples having overlap of extended regions.  

# Compare breakpoint profiles  

One of the important modules of BreCAN-DB allows one to compare user-uploaded new breakpoint profiles against hotspots or individual profiles already present in database (Figure 2C). The breakpoint profiles can either be uploaded as a file from local machine or paste in BED format. User can select type of cancer against which given breakpoint profile will be compared. On submitting data, module reports number of overlapping breakpoints with the hotspots and with the breakpoint profiles as sortable bar plots.  

# Submit breakpoint profiles  

For further populating the database, we have included a module wherein user can submit whole genome breakpoint profiles of different cancer genomes which will be made open for scientific community after curation. While submitting such profiles, we request submitters to describe methods to map breakpoints clearly in order to reduce method dependent biasing of the results.

Figure 2. (A) A view of ‘Breakpoint Profiles and hotspots Browser’ module in BreCAN-DB representing tracks of overlapping genes, breakpoint profiles and hotspots. The tracks in browser are divided into three sections: Section 1- tracks of human reference genome assembly hg19, chromosome bands and Refseq genes; Section 2- tracks of breakpoint hotspots. Each rectangular bar in these tracks represents one breakpoint hotspot; and Section 3- tracks of individual breakpoint profiles. Each rectangular bar in these tracks represents a $20\mathrm{Kb}$ region centralized at the breakpoint position. (B) ‘Map Breakpoint hotspots’ module takes breakpoint profiles as input and maps regions with breakpoint in at least given number of samples. (C) ‘Compare Breakpoint Profiles’ module compares user provided breakpoint profile against breakpoint hotspots and profiles present in the database and shows overlaps in the form of sortable bar plots.

# Download breakpoint profiles  

We also provide a ‘Download’ module to download all the 99 whole genome breakpoint profiles in BED format. This will be useful for users who want to locally run analysis through integrating BreCAN-DB data sets with their own data.  

# CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS  

Each cancer genome has unique set of structural GAs, SNPs and other genomic variations and keeping this in mind, BreCAN-DB has been developed as a unique database that not only allows user to visualize individual DNA breakpoint profiles across cancer types but also perform comparative study of their samples against existing data. Through BreCAN-DB, we provide a platform that is readily scalable for further sample’s data and allows study of somatic DNA personalized breakpoint at single nucleotide resolution. In summary, we have first developed a curated data set representing high-resolution breakpoint profiles for 99 cancer-normal pairs. Secondly, we systemically identified hotspot regions across cancer types using a novel strategy. Thirdly, we made these data accessible through an integrated next-generation genome browser. Fourthly, we created a platform, where users can perform comparative cancer genomics by checking intersection between their and BreCAN-DB data sets. These data sets can easily be extended by addition of more breakpoint profiles requiring no additional analyses or change in existing data sets as demonstrated through inclusion of data set from Yang et al. (26).  

In our data set, we noted that the mean number of breakpoints were higher than previously reported (26). Since we used the same software as used in previous study (Meerkat) for profiling breakpoints, it is unlikely that this difference is due to methodology of mining breakpoints. Rather, we speculate that this might be a sample specific effect as the number of breakpoints was variable across samples in both studies. Furthermore, we found that the average number of genomic alterations in our study (excluding translocations and inversions) were similar to the ones noted earlier (this study did not report translocations and inversions) (32).  

We request users to help scientific community by submitting such breakpoint profiles from their study to BreCAN  

DB. We believe that this database will prove useful for understanding large-scale personal cancer genomics data.

# ABSTRACT  

The 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) represents the most comprehensive world-wide nucleotide variation data set so far in humans, providing the sequencing and analysis of 2504 genomes from 26 populations and reporting ${>}84$ million variants. The availability of this sequence data provides the human lineage with an invaluable resource for population genomics studies, allowing the testing of molecular population genetics hypotheses and eventually the understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of genetic variation in human populations. Here we present PopHuman, a new population genomics-oriented genome browser based on JBrowse that allows the interactive visualization and retrieval of an extensive inventory of population genetics metrics. Efficient and reliable parameter estimates have been computed using a novel pipeline that faces the unique features and limitations of the 1000GP data, and include a battery of nucleotide variation measures, divergence and linkage disequilibrium parameters, as well as different tests of neutrality, estimated in non-overlapping windows along the chromosomes and in annotated genes for all 26 populations of the 1000GP. PopHuman is open and freely available at http://pophuman.uab.cat.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Soon after the elucidation of the entire human genome (1–3), the description of genetic variation in human populations and the identification of those variants that affect health and disease became the next challenges of genomics research (4). The International HapMap Consortium built the first genome-wide catalog of common human genetic variation in diverse populations (4–6), charting haplotype maps of 1.6 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1184 reference individuals from 11 global populations. In addition to numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (7), the HapMap data allowed the detection of positive natural selection across the human genome (8,9), as well as the development of new tests to infer recent episodes of selective sweeps based on the length of haplotypes, such as the Long-Range Haplotype (LRH) (10), the integrated Haplotype Score (iHS) (11), and the Cross Population Extended Haplotype Homozygosity (XP-EHH) (8).  

During the last decade, the development of next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies (12,13) has allowed the deciphering of complete genome sequences of thousands of human individuals, and the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP) has become the reference data set for population genetics and genomics (14,15). With the aim of providing a deep characterization of human genome sequence variation, the most recent version of the 1000GP (Phase III) completes the sequencing and analysis of 2504 genomes from 26 populations and describes most variants with frequencies as low as $1\%$ . Due to its higher resolution and smaller SNP ascertainment bias compared to HapMap genotyping data, the availability of the 1000GP data provides the human lineage with an invaluable resource on which to test molecular population genetics hypotheses and eventually understand the evolutionary dynamics of genetic variation in human populations (16).  

Regions of the genome that are (or have been) subject to natural selection show distinctive patterns of genetic variation in the DNA sequence (17). The signature of long-range haplotypes persists for a relatively short period of time ( $\scriptstyle<30$ 000 years), and related statistics can detect very recent selection only. However, other signatures persist longer in the genome: differentiation between populations $(<500000-$ $<75\ 000$ years), high frequency derived alleles ${<}80\ 000$ years), reduction in genetic diversity and excess of rare alleles ( $<250\ 000$ years), and high proportion of functionaltering substitutions between species (many millions of years) (17).  

Population genomics analyses of the 1000GP data set can be largely facilitated by (i) making an inventory of parameter values along the chromosomes that capture the evolutionary properties of the available sequences, and (ii) allowing the query and visualization of these estimates in a genome browser designed specifically for this data. As far as we are concerned, the 1000 Genomes Selection Browser 1.0 (18) is the only previous database that allows the interactive visualization and retrieval of population genetics metrics for the 1000GP data. It was published when the 1000GP was still in its first phase (1,092 individuals, 14 populations, 38 million SNPs) (14), and analyzed within-species polymorphism data for three populations in $30\mathrm{kb}$ sliding windows (18). Here, we present PopHuman, a new population genomics-oriented genome browser. PopHuman represents not only an update to the 1000GP Phase III (2504 individuals, 26 populations, 84.7 million SNPs), but also dramatic improvements in the amount of data analyzed and browser performance, compared to the 1000 Genomes Selection Browser 1.0. Furthermore, PopHuman analyzes betweenspecies divergence, which allows the implementation of statistical tests to detect the signature of recurrent natural selection acting over prolonged periods of time, such as the McDonald and Kreitman test (MKT) (19), instead of recent selective sweeps only. Supplementary Table S1 details the differences between the two databases.  

# POPHUMAN ANALYSIS PIPELINE  

We have designed and implemented a custom pipeline (Figure 1) facing the unique features and limitations of the 1000GP Phase III data (15). The pipeline discards reportedly inbred individuals (20) and non-accessible nucleotides (15), incorporates the genomic sequence of the chimpanzee (21) as outgroup, and estimates a battery of nucleotide variation, divergence and linkage disequilibrium parameters, as well as different tests of neutrality, on the filtered data. Several metrics have been computed both in non-overlapping sliding windows along the chromosomes and in annotated protein coding genes for 26 populations of distinct geographical origin (15).  

# Pre-processing of the 1000GP Phase III data  

We retrieved human genome variation data generated by the 1000GP Phase III (15) from http: //www.internationalgenome.org/data in Variant Call Format (VCF). This included 84.4 million variants detected across 2504 individuals from 26 different populations, mapped to the human reference genome version GRCh37/hg19. We want to warn the user that four of the analyzed populations present admixture (corresponding to the Admixed American metapopulation), so special care should be taken while interpreting PopHuman results in those cases.  

Inbred individuals. The initial VCF files were filtered to exclude 243 individuals with inbreeding coefficients similar or greater than the ones expected for first-cousin offspring, according to Gazal et al. (20).  

Genome accessibility mask. Due to the nature of shortread sequencing, sequencing depth varies along the length of the genome. The 1000GP provides an ‘accessibility mask’, a Browser Extensible Data (BED) file that indicates which sites of the genome were accessible to the sequencing techniques and have power for variant discovery (15). Two definitions were used in the Phase III, of which we selected the ‘pilot-style’ mask. This definition is less conservative than the ‘strict’ mask while being still adequate for population genomics analyses, and was chosen to maximize the amount of genomic sequence to be analyzed. It excludes the portion of the genome where depth of coverage (summed across all samples) was higher or lower than the average depth by a factor of 2-fold, as well as sites where $>20\%$ of overlapping reads had mapping quality of zero. Overall, $89.4\%$ of the genome is considered reliable $(95.9\%$ of the non-N bases). Specifically, we placed $10\mathrm{kb}$ non-overlapping sliding windows in accessible regions of the genome (i.e. windows do not overlap any non-accessible nucleotide) to focus on high quality genomic regions only. Table 1 summarizes the total amount of data analyzed by PopHuman by following this methodology. In addition, we analyzed longer non-overlapping sliding windows of $100\mathrm{kb}$ placed all along the genome (i.e. windows might overlap non-accessible nucleotides, although these positions were discarded for the population genomics analyses) to focus on broader scale patterns of diversity across the genome.  

Ancestral states. The ancestral states of human segregating sites were taken from the 1000GP Phase III (15), which were obtained by using the 6-way EPO alignments available in Ensembl v71 (22).  

Outgroup species. To compute divergence metrics and neutrality tests based on the comparison of polymorphism and divergence, we added differences between humans and chimpanzees to the VCF files, as identified from a precomputed $\mathrm{hg}19\ =>$ panTro4 alignment obtained from the VISTA browser (23) in multi-FASTA format (MFA). Specifically, the pairwise alignment was converted to VCF using custom scripts and merged with the 1000GP VCF files using bcftools merge.  

# Recombination  

The most recent human genetic sex-specific maps were obtained from Bh´erer et al. (24), based on a total of 104 246 informative meioses from six recent studies of human pedigrees.  

# Estimation of population genomics statistics  

Windows-based. Several windows-based variation statistics and tests of neutrality (Table 2) were computed for each population separately using the R package PopGenome (25) and custom functions, considering biallelic SNPs as within-species variation data. Haplotype-based statistics (iHS and XP-EHH) were computed in a multithreaded framework implemented by the program selscan (26), considering biallelic SNPs with Minor Allele Frequency $(\mathrm{MAF})>\mathsf{0}.05$ and a maximum gap of $20~\mathrm{kb}$ between two consecutive SNPs. Then, whole chromosome per-SNP scores were summarized by calculating the mean of the absolute value of these scores for all SNPs in a window (27). Sexual chromosomes were not analyzed in these cases.

Genes-based. Comparisons of DNA polymorphism within populations and divergence to an outgroup species using the MKT (19) have been extensively used to detect the signature of natural selection at the molecular level (28). The MKT can be generalized to any two types of sites provided that one of them is assumed to evolve neutrally and that both types of sites are closely linked in the genome (29–31). Furthermore, Mackay et al. (32) developed an integrative new framework for the MKT by incorporating information on the MAF of the segregating sites, which allows estimating the fraction of new mutations that are strongly deleterious (and therefore not segregating), slightly deleterious (segregating at low frequency), old neutral (neutral before the split of humans and chimpanzees), and recently neutral (since the split of humans and chimpanzees), as well as the fraction of adaptive fixations. The standard and integrative MKTs (Table 3) were applied to all annotated human protein coding genes in RefSeq (33) and for different types of sites (i.e. 0-fold nonsynonymous coding sites, $5^{\prime}\mathrm{UTR}$ , $3^{\prime}\mathrm{UTR}$ , introns, and $\pm500$ bp intergenic flanking regions, compared to 4-fold synonymous coding sites), for each population separately, using custom functions build within PopGenome (25).  

# OVERVIEW OF THE POPHUMAN GENOME BROWSER  

PopHuman is a new population genomics-oriented genome browser based on JBrowse (34) that allows the interactive visualization and retrieval of several metrics estimated in non-overlapping sliding windows along the chromosomes and in annotated genes for all 26 populations of the 1000GP. It also includes a number of utilities and support resources.  

# JBrowse implementation  

PopHuman is built on JBrowse (34) and is currently running under Apache on a CentOS 7.2 Linux x64 server with 16 Intel Xeon $2.4\mathrm{GHz}$ processors and 32 GB RAM.  

# Browser tracks  

Variation statistics. Windows-based variation statistics and tests of neutrality (Table 2) are classified into: (i) frequency-based nucleotide variation; (ii) divergence-based metrics; (iii) linkage disequilibrium; (iv) recombination; (v) selection tests based on the Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS) and/or variability and (vi) selection tests based on the MKT. They are displayed for each population separately as histogram plots, with a yellow line showing the mean, and two shaded bands showing $\pm1$ and $\pm2$ standard deviations from the mean. Visualization style can be customized using the ‘Edit config’ option for each track.  

Reference tracks. Several tracks have been imported from the UCSC Genome Browser (35) (Supplementary Table S2) and can be visualized along with variation statistics. They are classified into: (i) sequencing and annotation; (ii) regulation; (iii) comparative genomics; (iv) variation and (v) repeats.  

# Utilities and support resources  

Tracks selector. PopHuman contains more than a thousand tracks, including both variation statistics (Table 2) and reference tracks (Supplementary Table S2). Given the large number of tracks available, these can be filtered and selected using the ‘Select tracks’ tool, which can be accessed from the top left corner, below the navigation bar. The filtering process is normally performed by first narrowing the search using the menu on the left, and then selecting the tracks of interest from the main panel on the right. This process can be done several times in order to finally get all the desired tracks selected.  

Downloading raw data. Variation statistics for a given region can be conveniently downloaded in bedGraph, Wiggle or GFF3 formats using the ‘Save track data’ option for each track. In addition, bulk downloads of full variation tracks are available in BigWig format from the Resources menu. Finally, variant calls for the analyzed individuals can also be downloaded in VCF format using the PopHuman utility ‘Download sequences’, which can be accessed either from the Resources menu, or directly from the navigation bar.  

Integrative MKT. Gene-based MKTs (Table 3) can be retrieved by right-clicking a gene and selecting the option ‘Integrative MKT’.  

Help section. The Help section contains exhaustive documentation about the 1000GP Phase III data analyzed by PopHuman and details about the browser tracks. Interestingly, it contains a comprehensive tutorial introducing to the usage of the database and to the testing of evolutionary hypotheses from a population genetics perspective. The tutorial works out, in different sequential steps, the visualization and analysis of a genomic region of around $20\mathrm{kb}$ in chromosome 7 that includes the $T R P V6$ gene. $T R P V6$ is a well-studied protein coding gene involved in the absorption of calcium from the diet that has experienced parallel selective sweeps in non-African populations, coinciding with the establishment of agriculture first in Europe around $10\:000$ years ago, and later in Asia. The tutorial contains several step-by-step guides to facilitate reproducing the results that are shown both in the form of figures and descriptive text.  

# Availability  

All data, tools and support resources provided by PopHuman, as well as reference tracks downloaded from the UCSC Genome Browser (35), are open and freely available at http://pophuman.uab.cat.  

# COMPARISON TO OTHER DATABASES  

While the PopHuman analysis pipeline presented here is completely novel, the genome browser is based on a similar instance previously developed by our group that hosts population genomics statistics for 30 Drosophila melanogaster populations (36). Novel features that have been implemented in PopHuman include the utility to retrieve genebased integrative MKT metrics.

A comprehensive explanation is available under the section Help $\rightarrow$ Integrative MKT of PopHuman.  

Compared to the 1000 Genomes Selection Browser 1.0 (18), PopHuman presents three significant advantages. First, PopHuman analyzes the 1000GP Phase III data, which included 2.29 times more sampled sequences (2504 versus 1092) compared to the Phase I, and used an improved variant calling pipeline. Specifically, Phase III implemented an expanded set of variant callers, including some that use haplotype information and others that rely on de novo assembly, it considered low coverage and exome sequencing data jointly rather than independently, and used a different genotype calling that allowed the integration of multi-allelic variants and complex events (15). Second, PopHuman analyzes 26 instead of just three populations. This allows detecting very recent selective sweeps that have occurred in a single population and that can only be detected by analyzing data for this specific population; or older selective sweeps shared among a few related populations, whose detection gives a reinforcement of the time depth and biology underlying the specific selection signal. Three illustrative examples are provided: (i) a recent selective sweep related to skin pigmentation (37) in the region comprising the genes SLC24A5, MYEF2, SLC12A1 and CTXN2 in European (EUR) and South Asian (SAS) populations but not in East Asian (EAS) populations (Supplementary Figure S1); (ii) the presence of high frequency derived alleles in the gene $T R P V6$ in all non-African populations, with a stronger signature in EAS populations, intermediate in SAS populations, and weaker in EUR populations, reflecting the time frame in which the establishment of agriculture, and thus the corresponding selective sweeps, occurred in those populations (stronger signatures in more recent sweeps; Supplementary Figure S2) and (iii) the presence of high frequency derived alleles in the Duffy red cell antigen gene (DARC, FY, ACKR1) in sub-Saharan Africa, thought to be the result of selection for resistance to $P.$ vivax malaria (38,39), which is also seen in EAS populations (Supplementary Figure S3). Finally, PopHuman, contrary to the 1000 Genomes Selection Browser 1.0, implements selection tests based on the comparison of polymorphism and divergence, which are the only ones able to reveal the fixation of adaptive variants and other signatures of recurrent selection occurring over the last millions of years. One extreme example is found in the gene PRM1, which encodes a spermspecific protein that compacts sperm DNA and shows a clear excess of function-altering substitutions between humans and chimpanzees compared to synonymous substitutions, indicative of positive Darwinian selection (40,41) (Supplementary Figure S4).  

# CONCLUSION  

The PopHuman database and browser go a step forward in the description and analysis of the most comprehensive human diversity data to date from a population genomics perspective. We aim PopHuman to be extended to incorporate novel metrics of transcriptomic and epigenomic variation, not only across individuals and species but also during the lifetime of an individual and/or in different parts of the body. In this way, PopHuman will become a pioneer population multi-omics browser advancing the upcoming population –omics synthesis (16).

# Introduction  

Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is an important component of post-transcriptional gene regulation as variations in the selection of splice sites can alter coding sequence, transcript stability, transcript localization and protein abundance (1 2 . Detecting and quantifying isoforms of a given gene can thus quickly inform on possible function and associated regulatory mechanisms. Indeed, gene annotation efforts (e.g. GENCODE, Ensembl) report different isoforms for the vast majority of human genes, yet novel splicing variations are regularly identified when characterizing genes under certain conditions or systems 3 4 . This ndicates hat many ranscript soforms remain o be discovered, with some potentially playing key functional roles.  

In normal tissues, tightly regulated splicing programs contribute to specialized tissue or cell type-specific functions (5 . Such dedicated programs have been described in the brain, muscle, epidermis and blood, among other systems. A major hurdle to the identification of additional tissue-specific splicing events s he imited access o cross-tissue analyses and he need to include unannotated splicing variations.  

In contrast o normal splicing variations, disruption of such tissue specific splicing programs has been associated with numerous diseases, cancer in particular (6 7 . Specifically, splicing disruption is a feature commonly shared between tumor types (4 8  and mutations in proteins controlling splicing can drive oncogenesis (9 10 . On the upside, the abundance of aberrant splicing variations n cancer offers great potential or the development of new therapeutic avenues (7 . The identification of splicing variations as candidate therapeutic targets for a given type of cancer often raises the question about the presence of the same variation in other cancer types.  

Splicing databases are useful ools o nterrogate what splicing events occur in what tissues. Available databases come in different forms and address different problems. For example, the GTEx portal (11  provides exon expression data that can be used to extrapolate what transcript isoforms are used in each of 54 normal tissues. Other resources such as intropolis/Snaptron (12 13 , VastDB (14 , TSVdb (15 , RJunBase (16 , OncoSplicing (17 , recount3 (18 , MetazExp (19  and ASCancer Atlas (20  use different methods to describe splicing variations, using various datasets that can focus on normal human tissues or cancer, or include several species, and may offer a web interface or not (Supplementary Table S1).  

Here we present MAJIQlopedia, a database of splicing variations n normal human tissues and cancer. MAJIQlopedia offers wo nstances, one isting splicing variations ound n normal tissues and the second listing variations found in cancer. The normal tissue dataset comprises samples from large-scale projects such as GTEx and BLUEPRINT, but also includes smaller publicly available datasets to provide a comprehensive reference for a total of 86 solid tissue and hematopoietic cell types. The cancer dataset comprises samples from TCGA and Beat-AML as well as pediatric cancer samples from the TARGET and CBTN projects, for a total of 41 cancer cohorts. Compared to existing databases MAJIQlopedia offers several advantages. First s he breadth of he issue and cancer types included, as described above. Second, its splicing analysis was performed with the MAJIQ algorithm, which has been shown to compare favourably in detection and quantification of alternative splicing (21–23 . MAJIQ formulates alternative splicing as local splicing variations involving splits in a gene’s splice graph coming out of or nto a reference exon. This allows the MAJIQlopedia to capture complex splicing variations involving more than two splice junctions, as well as unannotated splice sites, junctions, exons and intron retention events (3 21 . Such unannotated events are commonly found in cancer (8 . The website optimizes the interface offered by our VOILA module to run quickly on the two very large datasets of cancer and normal samples. The database is accessible online (https://majiq.biociphers.org/majiqlopedia/ and offers a straightforward query process that facilitates the interrogation of any gene of interest, with a graphical presentation of he data. Users can also request o add data or nstall their own MAJIQlopedia instance with their data. We used MAJIQlopedia to review cases of known tissue-specific splicing regulation and uncover novel splicing variations n normal tissues and cancer.  

# Materials and methods  

# Datasets  

Seven publicly available datasets were downloaded and processed to generate the normal tissue instance of MAJIQlopedia: GTEx (24 , BLUEPRINT (25 , Leucegene (26 , a T cell sample dataset (27 , a bone sample dataset (28 , a mesenchymal bone marrow dataset (29  and an osteoblast dataset (30 . These datasets are listed in Supplementary Table S2. Four publicly available datasets were downloaded and processed to generate the cancer instance of MAJIQlopedia: TCGA (31 , TARGET (32 , Beat-AML (33  and CBTN (34 . These datasets are listed in Supplementary Table S3.  

# Data processing  

We limited technical biases by processing all RNA-Seq samples fastq files when possible or by first shuffling bam files and converting to fastq when raw sequencing files were unavailable. Sequencing adapters were trimmed with TrimGalore $_{(\mathrm{v}0.6.6)}$ (35 . Reads were aligned with STAR (v2.5.2a) (36  against the hg38 human genome assembly (37 . Mapped reads were sorted and indexed using samtools (v1.11) (38 . Gene expression quantification was carried out using Salmon (v0.14.0) (39  in quasi-mapping mode using an index generated with Ensembl GRCh38 transcriptome release 94. Splice junctions were quantified using MAJIQ (v2.2) (21 . MAJIQ defines alternative splicing n erms of ocal splicing variations (LSVs). For this reason, the same junction can be quantified twice by MAJIQ, .e. once rom he ${{\bar{S}}^{\prime}}$ splice site and once rom the $3^{\prime}$ splice site. Duplicate junctions (those that were counted twice) were identified as junctions sharing the exact same coordinates in the same gene. The number of splice junctions given in the text and in the figures correspond to the number of junctions after removing duplicates.  

# Generation of the MAJIQlopedia data  

Two MAJIQ builds were used to generate MAJIQlopedia, one for normal tissues and one for cancer. The same parameters were used in both cases. Samples belonging to a given tissue or cancer type were grouped together. The MAJIQ build was run using default parameters except for the minimum number of reads required to quantify a junction, which was set at 10 using the –minreads 10 tag. We then applied the MAJIQ PSI and MAJIQ VOILA modules with default parameters to quantify splicing variations.  

# Protein structure prediction and alignment  

MT1A structures were predicted using ESMFold (40 , and aligned and visualized using the RCSB Protein Database Bank Pairwise Structure Alignment tool (41 .

# Results  

# Generation of MAJIQlopedia  

We assembled publicly available RNA-Seq data from seven sources of normal tissue samples and four sources of cancer samples. Raw sequencing files were re-processed in the same way for all samples to minimize biases and version incompatibility in read alignment methods and reference genome and transcriptome annotations (Figure 1A). The quantifications available in MAJIQlopedia represent data from all samples that belong to a certain tissue or cancer type. All tissue types are composed of a minimum of three samples originating from three donors (Supplementary Figure 1).  

The MAJIQlopedia website allows users o query ndividual genes through three simple steps, by (i) first choosing whether splicing variations should be shown or normal issues or cancer, then (ii) entering the name of the gene of interest and finally (iii) visualizing quantifications available for all of the splicing variations that MAJIQ found in our dataset in the selected gene (Figure 1B). Quantifications are shown as violin plots and can be downloaded as images. Raw data underlying the generation of these plots are also available as a bulk download for all splice junctions in all tissues from the main page of the website. These data can be used to customize the graphical representation of the data according to the user’s need or to perform large-scale analyses across any number of genes.  

# Summary of the MAJIQlopedia database content  

From 7654 normal and $11\ 059$ cancer samples (Figure 2A and Supplementary Figure 1), we report 210 394 splicing variations totalling $486\ 175$ alternatively used splice junctions in normal tissues and $155~226$ splicing variations totalling 338 317 alternatively used splice junctions in cancer. We define variable junctions as junctions involved in a local splicing variation LSV) event where he unction s used at a minimum of $5\%$ in any tissue. Cancer samples tend to have more unannotated junctions than normal tissues (Figure 2B and Supplementary Figure 2), with splicing variations composed of $20.81\%$ (normal tissues) and $22.98\%$ (cancer) of splice junctions that are unannotated in the Ensembl GRCh38.94 reference ranscriptome. The number of alternative splice unctions detected in each tissue ranges from 184 886 (germinal B cells) to 44 293 (mesenchymal bone marrow cells) in normal tissues and $163~580$ (high-grade glioma) to $69032$ diffuse arge B-cell lymphoma) in cancer (Supplementary Figure 2). These metrics should not be nterpreted as a direct measure of he absolute abundance of alternative splicing occurring in a given tissue and should not be compared between tissues because splicing quantifications depend on the read depth of RNASeq samples and the number of samples in each tissue/cancer group, which vary between the datasets that we surveyed. Although the database was built separately for normal tissues and cancer, a vast majority of junctions quantified in normal tissues were also found in cancer (Figure 2C), making it possible to assess how a given junction is used in both sets.

D Number of genes binned by their otal number of variable splice unctions n any issue n normal tissues left) and cancer right).  

We next wondered how many variable splice junctions are found in each gene. About a quarter of genes quantified in MAJIQlopedia display little alternative splicing, with fewer than five variable junctions (Figure 2D). At the other end of the spectrum, 1550 genes have over 50 variable splice junctions in the context of normal tissues. Many of the genes with the largest number of variable junctions in normal tissues are large genes with numerous exons (e.g. TTN  109.2 kb transcript, 363 annotated exons in MANE transcript; SYNE2 $21.8\mathrm{kb}$ transcript and 116 annotated exons in MANE transcript; HERC1 $15.2\mathrm{kb}$ transcript and 78 annotated exons in MANE ranscript). Low but measurable evels of ntron retention exist n some issues or hese genes, which contributes o the high number of variable junctions reported (Supplementary Figure 3A). When normalizing the number of variable splice junctions by the number of exons in the canonical transcript annotation of protein-coding genes MANE or Ensembl Canonical transcripts), we find that genes with high levels of splice junction variation display complex splicing patterns. These variations can nvolve annotated e.g. CMC2 ZNF655 or unannotated e.g. UBC MRPL43 splice unctions Supplementary Figure 3B).  

# Tissue-regulated splicing variations in MAJIQlopedia  

We sought to illustrate how the quantifications provided in MAJIQlopedia correspond to the splicing patterns expected from the literature for well-known cases of disease-associated alternative splicing events. n the WT1 gene, skipping of exon 5 is frequent in Wilms tumor, where a common mutation alters the splice donor downstream of exon 5 (42 43 . In line with the literature, MAJIQlopedia shows that Wilms tumor samples have lower exon 5 inclusion levels than other cancer types such as acute myeloid leukemia, mesothelioma or ovarian cancer (Figure 3A). In the MAPT gene, skipping of exon 10 results in the loss of one of four microtubule-binding sequences and he ratio between exon 10 nclusion and skipping likely impacts neurodegeneration in tauopathies (44–46 . Another alternative splicing event in MAPT concerns the inclusion of exon 3, which is associated with Parkinsonian disorders (47 . The inclusion of both of these exons varies by brain region 48 49 . As expected, MAJIQlopedia shows variable nclusion levels between brain regions for both exon 3 and exon 10 (Figure 3B). Intriguingly, MAPT exons 3 and 10 are also alternatively used in cancer (Figure 3B).  

We also ooked nto normal issue-specific splicing patterns. The BIN1 gene is known for differential inclusion of an exon in neural tissues and a separate exon differentially included in muscle (50 51 . Interrogating MAJIQlopedia for BIN1 allowed us to quickly appreciate how inclusion of BIN exon 7 is restricted to tissues from the nervous system, whereas inclusion of exon 11 is mostly restricted to muscle (Figure 3C). Additional known splicing variations involving exons 14–17 are also represented in the database with complex and highly variable splicing patterns in normal tissues (Supplementary Figure 4A). Interestingly, we observed that inclusion of the neural exon 7 and inclusion of the muscle exon 11 also occur in neuroblastoma and head and neck cancer, respectively (Supplementary Figure 4B). These results are in line with the fact that, while anatomically distinct from the nervous system, neuroblastoma originates from neural cells (52 . As for the inclusion of exon 11 in head and neck cancer (Supplementary Figure 4B), this event could reflect the tissue of origin of the cancer, since exon 11 is also included in the salivary gland (Figure 3C), albeit at lower levels than in muscle.  

# Discovery of novel splicing variations  

In order to demonstrate the value of MAJIQlopedia for the identification of novel alternative splicing events, we asked whether splicing variations exist in genes for which only one transcript has been annotated in Ensembl (53 , GENCODE (54  and RefSeq (55 , and no splicing variations were previously reported. We ound such variations n multiple genes, ncluding in FDX1 and MEGF9  The mitochondrial ferredoxin gene FDX1 is involved in the synthesis of steroid hormones. The gene has four exons but only one annotated transcript. PubMed searches return no publications mentioning alternative splicing or the existence of transcript isoforms in FDX1

B The MT1A skipping event esults n he runcation of he beta domain, but preserves he alpha domain. C A novel exon inclusion event n he RPS6KA6 s only ound n a pediatric high-grade glioma cohort and a pediatric clear cell sarcoma of he kidney cohort. The splicegraphs at he op show hat MAJIQlopedia contains no evidence of alternative splicing n normal issues, but some variations n cancer, most notably he nclusion of a novel exon between exons 2 and 3. D Raw eads compiled rom 13 samples of clear cell sarcoma of he kidney confirming novel exon nclusion. E Exon 2a nclusion evels compared o otal gene expression of RPS6KA6 n high-grade glioma and clear cell sarcoma of he kidney samples.  

However, MAJIQlopedia shows that a novel $159\mathrm{nt}$ exon between exons 3 and 4 has nclusion evels of $13\%$ specifically n hematopoietic stem cells (Supplementary Figure 5A). MEGF9 is a putative transmembrane receptor that is developmentally regulated. MEGF9 has 6 exons and, ust like FDX1 only one annotated transcript and no publication mentions alternative splicing or multiple isoforms for MEGF9 We discovered that alpha-beta $\mathrm{CD4+}$ T cells, monocytes and neutrophils use a novel $123\mathrm{nt}$ exon between exons 2 and 3 of MEGF9 with inclusion levels of $15\%$ (Supplementary Figure 5B).  

In both cases, the novel exons preserve the reading frame but introduce stop codons in the coding sequence. The FDX1 exon encodes two consecutive stop codons in the penultimate exon. The fate of the FDX1 transcript that includes the novel exon is uncertain because transcripts with premature stop codons close to the end of the coding sequence, ncluding in the penultimate exons, can escape nonsense mediated decay (56 . If escaping nonsense mediated decay, this transcript would encode an FDX1 protein isoform lacking the last 13 residues of the 2Fe-2S ferredoxin-type domain. On the other hand, the MEGF9 exon introduces three stop codons several exons upstream of the last exon. It can be expected that the inclusion of the novel MEGF9 exon renders the transcripts sensitive o nonsense-mediated decay. n ine with his assumption, we find that neutrophil and monocyte samples that have high nclusion of he novel exon also have ower MEGF9 ranscript levels (Supplementary Figure 5C). The use of NMDinducing exons, often referred o as poison exons’, s a known mechanism for regulating gene expression (57 . Whether the novel exon is involved in the regulation of MEGF9 levels will require further investigation.  

We also found a novel splicing event in the metallothionein MT1A gene, which is involved in metal detoxification and oxidative stress prediction. We observed that alternative skipping of MT1A exon 2 is an isoform that co-exists with the only known transcript at variable levels ranging from $10\%$ o $20\%$ in all solid tissues where the variation is quantified (Figure 4A). Skipping of exon 2 preserves the reading frame of the coding sequence, but removes $22\mathrm{aa}$ in the beta domain of the protein (Figure 4B). The predicted structure for the skipped isoform aligns well with he canonical soform and shows hat the alpha domain is mostly preserved (Figure 4B). The loss of the beta domain would reduce he binding capacity of he protein rom seven metal atoms o our and prevent he ormation of the supermetalated intermediate MT1A species (58 .  

Finally, we wondered if MAJIQlopedia contained information about splicing variations that occur in cancer, but not in normal tissues. There are 822 genes that have at least two alternative splice junctions in at least one cancer type, but no alternative junction used over $5\%$ in any normal tissue. One of those genes is the ribosomal kinase RPS6KA6 gene, which only has one annotated transcript. In agreement with the literature, no splicing variations are observed in normal tissues. However, MAJIQlopedia shows that there is inclusion of a novel exon between exons 2 and 3 of RPS6KA6 in pediatric cohorts of high-grade glioma and clear cell sarcoma of the kidney at level of $15\%$ and $25\%$ , respectively (Figure 4C). nspection of raw read alignments confirms the inclusion of the novel exon, labeled as ‘exon $2\mathrm{a}'$ (Figure 4D). While exon 2a shifts he reading rame of he coding sequence and ntroduces several stop codons, here is no clear relationship between the level of exon 2a inclusion and lower transcript levels in the two cancer cohorts that we looked at (Figure 4E).  

# Discussion  

In this work, we introduce MAJIQlopedia, a new database with a matching webtool, for exploring splicing variations across normal and cancer samples. Using several examples, we illustrate how MAJIQlopedia can be used to analyze known splicing variations as well as a hypothesis generator, identifying novel splicing variations that are tissue or cancer specific. In addition, users can submit requests to add data or install their own private instance with specific data of interest.  

One caveat of MAJIQlopedia is that it does not include developmental issues. We hope o address his n uture updates as new datasets become available. Another limitation is that we are unable to include sample level information. This limitation s due o data access restrictions and not nherent o he tool as both MAJIQ and he visualization package VOILA can display such nformation. Another uture direction o enhance MAJIQlopedia is to incorporate long-reads and full isoform information. It is also important to note that the information provided n MAJIQlopedia, as or all other splicing databases, is not well suited to perform differential splicing analyses between conditions. For such ests users should nstead run MAJIQ directly for conditions of interest and consider running MOCCASIN to correct for unknown or known confounders such as batch effects (59 .  

Overall, we believe that MAJIQlopedia, with its unique set of eatures, supported datasets, and ease of use, will be of great value to the large community of researchers seeking to understand how the expression of their favorite genes might be regulated and those looking to understand tissue- or cancerspecific splice isoform usage.

# Abstract  

Extensive evidence has demonstrated hat he human microbiome and probiotics confer great mpacts on human health, particularly during critical developmental stages such as pregnancy and infancy when microbial communities undergo remarkable changes and maturation. However, a major challenge in understanding the microbial community structure and interactions between mothers and infants lies in the current lack of comprehensive microbiome databases specifically ocused on maternal and nfant health. To address his gap, we have developed an extensive database called MAMI (Microbiome Atlas of Mothers and Infants) that archives data on the maternal and neonatal microbiome, as well as abundant resources on edible probiotic strains. By leveraging this resource, we can gain profound insights into the dynamics of microbial communities, contributing to lifelong wellness for both mothers and infants through precise modulation of the developing microbiota. The functionalities incorporated into MAMI provide a unique perspective on the study of the mother–infant microbiome, which not only advance microbiome-based scientific research but also enhance clinical practice. MAMI is publicly available at https://bioinfo.biols.ac.cn/mami/

# Introduction  

The human microbiome across multiple body sites has demonstrated substantial impacts on human health (1–3 , particularly during the crucial stages of gestation and infancy, when microbial communities undergo remarkable changes and maturation (4 . The investigation of how microbial communities shift and assemble during pregnancy and early life, and their profound influences on maternal and infant health, has attracted considerable nterest. The microbiota on neonates’ and infants’ bodies is particularly immature and undergoes rapid development in the first few years of life (5 6 . Recent studies have shown that the human gut microbiome stabilizes by the age of 2–3 years and becomes foundational for lifelong wellness (5 7 8 . The initial acquisition and subsequent development of the microbiota in infancy are crucial for establishing a healthy host-microbiome symbiosis and are influenced by several essential factors including delivery mode (9–11 , gestational age (5 , feeding regimen (5 12 , the use of probiotics or antibiotics (13–15 . The maternal microbiota is particularly vital n his process. Growing evidence supports he association between dysbiosis of the maternal microbiota during pregnancy and various diseases, such as preterm birth 16 17 , gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (1  and pre-eclampsia (18 19 . Importantly, maternal unhealthy status can also lead to neonatal microbiota dysbiosis through the vertical motherto-infant ransmission of he microbiome across multiple body sites (20–23 . However, he current lack of comprehensive microbiome databases specifically focused on maternal and infant health poses a challenge in characterizing the microbial community structure and dynamics across various life stages, as well as understanding the microbial interactions between mothers and infants.  

In the past few decades, it has been widely confirmed in many studies that probiotics can effectively promote health or prevent disease in various aspects (24 , such as improving nutritional status (25 , boosting immunity (26 27 , modulating gut microbiota (27 , and even reducing stress (28 . As societal awareness of health and the crucial role of probiotics continues to grow, various probiotic strains have been used in diverse products, garnering increasing popularity and public recognition. In addition, under the impetus of scientific research on probiotics, many of them have been registered as patents and trademarks, which create substantial commercial value. These developments have greatly acilitated the functional investigation of probiotics and the exploration of novel strains. Of particular interest is their potential application in preterm neonates and infants, whose developing microbial communities on multiple body sites are malleable and more amendable to intervention. This suggests promising possibilities for clinical practices aimed at modulating the microbiome and enhancing infant health (29 . Appropriate probiotic administration stands as a primary clinical ntervention, which has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness. For example, L. rhamnosus GG (LGG) has shown benefits in preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea AAD) 30 and eczema (31 . Another widely used probiotic, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12 (BB-12), has proven effective in managing infant colic (32 . However, despite these valuable findings, there remains a lack of a comprehensive knowledge base that consolidates all available probiotic resources for further investigation and inquiries.  

In recent years, here has been a rapid ncrease n he volume of human microbial data including 16S rRNA and metagenomic sequences. Most of these raw sequencing data have been deposited into general databases such as the EBI ENA (European Nucleotide Archive) (33  and the NCBI SRA (Sequence Read Archive) 34 , which have significantly promoted data reusability and enabled cross-project meta-analysis. Furthermore, he continuous emergence and updating of metagenomic analysis tools like QIIME2 (35 , microbial biomarker identification tools like NetMoss (36 , and microbial taxonomic databases such as Silva 37 have significantly enhanced our ability to gain in-depth insights into human microbiota and its vital role in influencing human wellness. However, there still exists a challenge related to the organization and mining of massive raw data, especially for non-coding researchers who may encounter difficulties in using code-based tools.  

To address these gaps, we present an extensive knowledge base called MAMI (Microbiome Atlas of Mothers and Infants), which archives he most extensive maternal and neonatal microbiome datasets available to date, as well as information on probiotic strains suitable for the infant population. The exclusive resources and comprehensive functionalities offered by MAMI will greatly acilitate research efforts concerning the relationships between mother–infant health and microbiota (see Figure 1 . By leveraging this extensive resource and the development of practical tools, we can gain nuanced insights into the dynamics of microbial communities that underlie ifelong wellness. mportantly, precise modulation of he developing microbiota holds the potential to greatly enhance the health outcomes of both mothers and infants.  

# Materials and methods  

# Data collection  

Raw sequencing reads of microbial samples were searched in published literature and downloaded from the EBI ENA (33 , NCBI SRA (34  and MG-RAST (https://www.mg-rast.org/ (38 . The maternal and neonatal host-related meta-data of he downloaded samples such as age, sex, country, gestational age, delivery mode, feeding regimen and breastfeeding duration days were extracted for further curation. Probiotic resources were collected from multiple sources: microbial introduction of probiotic strains is mainly from MicrobeWiki (https: //microbewiki.kenyon.edu/ ndex.php/ , Wikipedia (https://en. wikipedia.org/wiki/  and Genbank (https://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/datasets/genome/ , functional studies of probiotic strains are from NCBI PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/) and Europe PMC (https://europepmc.org/), food and medicine of probiotic strains are mainly from AEProbio (https://aeprobio.com/ , probiotic patents were mainly from Google Patents (https://patents.google.com/ .  

# Data processing  

For 16S amplicon sequences, the QIIME2 pipeline (version 2021.11) (35  was used for quality control and taxonomic assignments. After importing raw sequence data, DADA2 (39 integrated into QIIME2 was used for quality control including quality filtering, paired-end sequence merging, denoising and chimera removal o construct amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Feature classifiers were trained using different hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA genes against he Silva reference database (version 138) (37  clustered at $99\%$ identity. The feature-classifier plugin in QIIME2 was performed on ASVs for taxonomic analysis (40 . Relative abundances were then calculated for each sample at the genus level with total abundances of $100\%$ .  

For metagenomic sequences, FastQC version 0.11.9, https: //www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/ astqc/  was used for quality control. Kneaddata (version 0.12.0, https:// huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/kneaddata/  was applied for removing low quality bases and host sequences to obtain clean reads. MetaPhlAn 3 (version 3.0) (41  was subsequently performed with default parameters for the taxonomic assignments. The relative abundances were calculated at genus or species levels with total abundances of $100\%$ , respectively.  

To better combine all the microbial datasets and accurately characterize the detailed features of the microbiome on different body sites, we ran the $\mathrm{ConQuR}$ (42  method with default parameters on the combined dataset to remove the technical effects. In addition, according to the rarefaction curve estimation (Supplementary Figure S1), the number of sequences can well represent microbial features and diversities of each community.

# Implementation  

The back-end was implemented using PHP (https://www.php. net/) scripts. All data were stored in a MySQL database (https://www.mysql.com/ . The front-end was implemented using HTML, CSS and Javascript with Bootstrap (https:// getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/  framework and provided users with a user-friendly and interactive interface. Echarts (https: //echarts.apache.org/  was adopted for providing state-ofthe-art web visualizations. The website is hosted on an Apache Server https://httpd.apache.org/ . Moreover, all pages of MAMI were tested on the major browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox for various terminal equipment including computers, ablets and mobile phones, which ensures perfect user experience in most scenarios.  

# Results  

# Sample statistics  

To date, the MAMI initiative has successfully enrolled over 39000 maternal and neonatal microbial samples from 29 countries across six continents (Figure 2A). These extensive datasets serve as the fundamental foundation of the MAMI database, providing a comprehensive landscape for exploring human microbiota shifts during key life stages, including the female perinatal period and early infancy. Despite limitations in public data resources, we have curated clinical information related to each sample to better understand and unveil the maturation of neonatal microbiota and dynamics of maternal microbiota. For microbial samples from pregnant and postpartum mothers, we primarily collected two essential clinical features: delivery mode and gestational age, which are considered to be leading factors associated with maternal health as well as influencing their offspring’s microbiota (5 9–11 . Regarding microbial samples from neonates and infants, we further curated more specific clinical features, such as delivery mode, gestational age, sex, feeding regimen (Figure 2B).  

Notably, we focus on multiple body sites of both mothers and infants rather than one single body site. Specifically, we collected microbial samples from six body sites in mothers, including gut, skin, nasal cavity, oral cavity, vagina and breast milk (Figure 2C). For neonatal samples, we included four body sites (gut, skin, nasal cavity and oral cavity) (Figure 2D). Among them, microbial samples from the vagina and gut constitute a significant proportion of maternal and neonatal samples, respectively. To gain insights into microbiota dynamics, we also recorded temporal information for each sample. Maternal samples span across the pregnant and postpartum periods (Figure 2E), while neonatal samples mainly cover the first three years of life (Figure 2F).

# Characteristics of maternal microbiome in perinatal stage  

During gestational and postpartum periods, maternal microbiotas across different body sites undergo subtle alterations that significantly influence the offspring’s microbiome and postnatal health outcomes (43 44 . MAMI offers extensive microbial resources related to maternal body sites across different perinatal stages, allowing users to explore the characteristics of the maternal microbiome and compare them with multiple custom datasets. For example, our analysis revealed distinct microbial structures ANOSIM on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, $R\:=\:0.723$ , $P=0.001$ ) (Supplementary Figure S2) and microbial diversities (Supplementary Figure S3) (45  among bacterial communities colonizing different maternal body sites. Among the six body sites, the vagina microbiota exhibited the lowest alpha diversity, mainly due to the dominance of Lactobacillus  In contrast, the gut microbiota, known for its complexity, displayed the highest alpha diversity, with Bacteroides  Prevotella  Feacalibacterium and Bifidobacterium as the dominant genera (Figure 3A).  

Moreover, we observed remarkable similarities between the microorganisms colonizing the skin and nasal cavity, with Cutibacterium  Corynebacterium  Streptococcus and Staphylococcus being the most abundant genera in both body sites (Figure 3A).  

The microbiota present in breast milk from mothers exhibited distinct abundance differences in multiple dominant genera compared to other body sites (Figure 3A). Since the substantial evidence supporting the essential role of breast milk microbiota in the succession and maturation of neonatal microbiota (46 47 , we then focused on the differences in breast milk microbiota across various continents and lactation periods, as curated within the MAMI database. We observed that the breast milk microbiota from Africa displayed the most pronounced differences when compared to samples from Asia and North America (ANOSIM on BrayCurtis dissimilarity, $R=0.46,P=0.001)$ Supplementary Figure S4). Among African mothers, the most abundant genera in breast milk were Streptococcus Rhodococcus Methylobacterium and Cupriavidus  while Streptococcus and Staphylococcus dominated the breast milk microbiota in Asia and North America (Figure 3B). During different lactation periods, Streptococcus consistently remained the most abundant genus, maintaining a relatively stable abundance. In contrast, other genera exhibited fluctuations in their abundance levels as lactation progressed (Figure 3C).

# Difference and development of neonatal microbiome in early life  

With the extensive datasets curated in MAMI, users can easily gain a comprehensive understanding of the differences in neonatal microbiome in early life. Similar to the maternal microbiota, he bacterial communities n different neonatal body sites exhibited distinct patterns ANOSIM on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, $R=0.522$ , $P=0.001$ ) (Supplementary Figure S5). While considerable genera were present exclusively in the neonatal gut microbiome, very few genera were found only in the neonatal oral cavity and skin (Supplementary Figure S6). For example, he infant gut microbiota was characterized by high abundance of Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides while Streptococcus and Moraxella dominated the infant oral cavity and nasal cavity communities, respectively. n contrast, he infant skin microbiota displayed a dominant colonization by more diverse genera. The community diversities among the four body sites were also significantly different (Figure 3D).  

Many previous studies have highlighted the progressive changes in the microbial community structure of the infant gut, emphasizing its close relationship with nfant health 48 . We observed that the microbial composition of the infant gut underwent dramatic dynamics in early life. Most remarkably,  

Bifidobacterium dominated he nfant gut microbiota until six months of age, but subsequently, its advantage was replaced by Bacteroides  As infants continued to grow, pioneer genera such as Escherichia and Enterococcus gradually decreased, while Blautia and Faecalibacterium exhibited a gradual increase, ultimately becoming the dominant genera in the infant gut microbiota (Figure 3E). This development of infant gut microbiome is considered a sign of microbial maturation, which has profound implications for infant health. The rich resources n MAMI offer a unique opportunity o delve deeper into the intricacies of these microbial dynamics during early life.  

Vertical transmission from mothers to infants has been observed in many studies (20 21 49 . In the MAMI database, the collection of microbial samples from matched mother– infant pairs presents an excellent opportunity to analyze microbial transmission and potential interactions across generations. Although the 16S amplicon sequencing has some limitations in resolution, we successfully identified a substantial fraction of shared microbes n mother–infant pairs across multiple body sites (Figure 3F). We found that Streptococcus was the most prevalent genus in various body sites and constituted the largest proportion of all shared genera. Notably,  

Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides were particularly shared between he maternal and neonatal gut, with he ormer enriched in the infant microbiota and the latter dominating the maternal microbiota. Corynebacterium and Cutibacterium were exclusively shared in the nasal cavity and skin of the maternal and neonatal microbiota, although their prevalence varied. The presence of these shared taxa across different body sites highlight he strong microbial connection between mothers and their offspring (Figure 3F).  

# Probiotics maintain maternal and neonatal health  

As an increasing number of studies and clinical trials show the prominent efficacy of probiotics in disease prevention and treatment, the inclusion of probiotic resources has become an essential component of MAMI. Probiotic interventions are widely recognized as relatively non-invasive, safe and costeffective therapies for many conditions (24 50 . However, the immature immune systems of neonates or infants, especially those born prematurely or by cesarean section, render them vulnerable to external influences (29 . Therefore, it is crucial to conduct thorough research to understand the mechanisms of probiotics and to evaluate the safety and efficacy of probiotic administration to infants. We concentrate on curating the probiotics which are commonly regarded as safe and strains known to be edible for infants (Figure 4 .  

The selected probiotic strains, along with their compositions, have been extensively studied and registered as patents in various regions. Examples of these well studied strains include Limosilactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938, LGG and Bifidobacterium breve M-16V, which have been utilized in various industries for decades. Notably, Limosilactobacillus reuteri DSM 17938 s widely used as an ndispensable component of probiotic supplementation and medicine for its exceptional effects in treating infantile diseases such as necrotizing enterocolitis (51 , infant colic (52 , diarrhea (53 , and allergic asthma (54 . The strain information for these probiotics is readily accessible to related researchers through MAMI.  

# Database usage  

MAMI s reely accessible via a web browser at https://bioinfo. biols.ac.cn/mami/ and provides users a distinct perspective on studying the mother–infant microbiome through various functions:  

1) The ‘Home’ page presents the theme and objectives of MAMI, with four major functional entrances for users to navigate. The page also includes geographical distribution and data statistics of microbial samples.   
2) The ‘Search’ page enables users to explore microbes present in maternal and neonatal microbiota at different taxonomic levels, as well as curated probiotic strains in the database. Clicking on any item in the search results leads to the ‘Detail’ page for further browsing.   
3) The ‘Browse’ page provides multiple visualizations of a specified population’s microbiome through filter boxes. Users can examine abundance, prevalence, dynamics, diversity and network diagrams to investigate the microbiota. Moreover, users have the option to upload their own taxonomic abundance table for personalized visualizations.   
4) The ‘Analysis’ page focuses on comparative analyses between two groups of microbiomes. By setting filters similar to those on the ‘Browse’ page, users can select two specific populations for comparative results on abundance, prevalence, diversity and network, enabling the study of microbiome differences.   
5) The Probiotics’ page consists of our modules: probiotic list, food, medicine and patent. MAMI concentrates on functional probiotic strains that promote maternal and neonatal health, with a special emphasis on probiotic strains available or edible for infants.   
6) The Resource’ page provides download inks or he raw sequence accession numbers, and all raw data is accessible for reprocessing and reanalyzing purposes.   
7) The ‘Help’ page provides comprehensive documentation of MAMI for reference. If users encounter issues that the documentation does not address or if they have suggestions on the database, feedback and comments are warmly welcomed.  

# Discussion and future developments  

MAMI is a comprehensive database that integrates maternal and neonatal microbiome datasets from multiple body sites and crucial life stages, along with carefully curated probiotic resources. The platform leverages advanced visualization tools to illustrate the patterns within the mother–infant microbiome to its users. In recent years, the rapid growth of human microbiome data has led to the creation of several databases collect and re-process such data. Examples of such databases include gutMDisorder (http://bio-annotation.cn/ gutMDisorder/) (55 , GutMeta (https://gutmeta.deepomics. org/ , and gutMGene (http://bio-annotation.cn/gutmgene/ (56 . These databases usually focus on specific subjects and aid users in finding relevant information of interest. However, MAMI is the first database that allows easy exploration of the microbiome related to mothers and infants across various body sites and different periods.  

MAMI also places significant emphasis on probiotics, recognizing their potential to profoundly modulate infant microbiota and improve health outcomes. The database integrates abundant probiotic resources, including detailed introduction, functions, applications in food and medicine, and patented strains. These resources are made accessible to users through interactive web pages. Compared to other similar databases, such as ProBioQuest (http://kwanlab.bio.cuhk.edu.hk/PBQ/  (57  and Optibac Probiotics https://www.optibacprobiotics.com/professionals/ probiotics-database/), MAMI distinguishes itself by offering comprehensive resources of functional probiotic strains specifically tailored for infants. The database provides an extensive collection of information dedicated to probiotics beneficial for neonatal health. MAMI commits to continuously expand and update ts probiotic resources n subsequent versions.  

In addition o he ongoing collection of new microbial samples from mothers and infants, MAMI plans to incorporate additional contents and features in future versions. One significant addition will be the inclusion of phenotype information related to both mothers and neonates. The availability of such data will greatly enhance our ability to investigate the relationship between microbiota and human health. Furthermore, he pattern of vertical transmission from mothers to infants and the interactions involved are crucial for understanding microbial community succession in early life, MAMI will be equipped with urther utilities o support n-depth research on this topic.

# ABSTRACT  

With the accumulation of massive data sets from high-throughput experiments and the rapid emergence of new types of omics data, gene sets have become more diverse and essential for the refinement of gene annotation at multidimensional levels. Accordingly, we collected and defined 236 007 gene sets across different categories for 44 plant species in the Plant Gene Set Annotation Database (PlantGSAD). These gene sets were divided into nine main categories covering many functional subcategories, such as trait ontology, co-expression modules, chromatin states, and liquid-liquid phase separation. The annotations from the collected gene sets covered all of the genes in the Bras icaceae species Arabidopsis and Poaceae species Oryza sativa. Several GSEA tools are implemented in PlantGSAD to improve the efficiency of the analysis, including custom SEA for a flexible strategy based on customized annotations, SEACOMPARE for the crosscomparison of SEA results, and integrated visualization features for ontological analysis that intuitively reflects their parent-child relationships. In summary, PlantGSAD provides numerous gene sets for multiple plant species and highly efficient analysis tools. We believe that PlantGSAD will become a multifunctional analysis platform that can be used to predict and elucidate the functions and mechanisms of genes of interest. PlantGSAD is publicly available at http://systemsbiology.cau.edu.cn/PlantGSEAv2/.  

# INTRODUCTION  

The continued development and widespread availability of high-throughput techniques allow for the exploration of changes and regulation at a whole genome-wide level under certain conditions. It is important to integrate the large number of data sets generated by high-throughput experiments for gene annotation, especially when working with gene sets. The gene ontology (GO) system is a common functional category widely used in plenty of analysis platforms and tools, such as DAVID (1,2) and agriGO (3,4). Due to the limitation of GO gene sets, several platforms, such as MSigDB (5), WebGestalt (6) and PlantGSEA (7), have been designed to assign genes to categories based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic processes, gene families, and some curated gene sets. All of these gene sets can be used to compute the overlap with a query gene list for the biological interpretation using gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (8).  

The biological knowledge associated with gene sets is gradually extending beyond pre-existing gene set categories, with multiple diverse data sets emerging and new functional categories being introduced. For example, co-expression modules (CoMs) (9) are a new functional category that has been added into some platforms and databases, including EviNet (10), WebGestalt 2017 (6), ccNET (11) and MCENet (12). In addition, various forms of epigenetic regulation, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and histone variants, have been widely implicated in the control of complex biological activities (13). Specific combinations of multiple epigenetic marks at the whole genome level can be defined as chromatin states, which play a meaningful role in various biological processes. Recently, there have also been significant advances in research on liquidliquid phase separation (LLPS), single cell RNA-seq and RNA binding proteins in biological systems, leading to new data types. It has been reported that LLPS is associated with chromatin compartmentalization in transcriptional regulation (19–21). At the same time, plant research has extended into three-dimensional (3D) genomics analysis (14) and 3D genomic data from various plant species have been published using Hi-C and ChIA-PET techniques (15–18). However, 3D-related categories for gene sets associated with HiC and LLPS are seldom present in databases and platforms for search and analysis.  

Although some resources with gene set annotations and analyses are available, including PAGED (22) and  

GeneSetDB (23), they mainly focused on the disease-related gene sets in human and typical gene sets from model species. In addition, both PAGED (22) and GeneSetDB (23) were published in 2012 and lacked novel data types such as chromatin state-based gene sets, LLPS gene sets, and singlecell RNA-seq cluster gene sets. For plants, the functional genome database of some species covers the common types of gene sets. For example, The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) (24) database offers GO and KEGG categories for Arabidopsis. However, there is no existing database that broadly integrates gene sets across different categories for plant species or that provides gene annotations at multidimensional levels for plant communities. Therefore, it is necessary to expand the number of data types and gene sets for a wider range of plant species and to logically organize the gene set categories.  

To meet the growing demands of researchers and users, we built the Plant Gene Set Annotation Database (PlantGSAD) and uploaded enough novel categories of gene sets from plant species, including CoMs, chromatin states, and LLPS. Currently, PlantGSAD contains $236\ 007$ gene sets across nine main functional categories for 44 plant species. All of these gene sets can be browsed and specific detailed knowledge of gene sets can be searched for. In addition, GSEA analysis is available in the background for the collected gene sets to produce comprehensive output report and graphical visualization for each gene set category. Other useful tools in PlantGSAD include customized singular enrichment analysis (SEA), SEACOMPARE (the cross comparison of SEA results), dot plot drawer and ID conversion. We believe that PlantGSAD is beneficial for gene function analysis and as a reference platform for plant species. It is freely available at http://systemsbiology.cau. edu.cn/PlantGSEAv2.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Data sources and integration  

We collected gene sets across different types of data from various resources, and organized them using a curation workflow. The data sources used for gene sets are listed in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1.  

The ontology gene sets included gene ontology (GO), plant ontology (PO), and trait ontology (TO); these were downloaded from related annotation databases, such as agriGOv2 (3), Phytozome (25), TAIR (24), Planteome (26) and RiceData (http://www.ricedata.cn). The PO and TO gene sets were re-computed to cover every term (including the parent terms) and organized as formatted annotation files. We also collected the gene sets from KEGG (27), PlantCyc (28) and MapMan (29), and grouped them as pathway gene sets.  

With regard to the gene family-based gene sets, the gene families were collected from genomics platforms (e.g. MCENet (12) for maize and ccNET (11) for cotton), and specific gene family databases (e.g. PlantTFDBv4.0 (68) for transcription factor families and iUUCDv2.0 (30) for ubiquitin proteasome system-related gene families). The collected data were manually curated to remove redundancy and conflicts.  

We also integrated the gene sets related to transcription regulation. The data sets and genome-wide annotation in PCSD database (31) were organized into chromatin state (Sta) gene set, epigenetic mark related gene set (ERG), and chromatin associated factor related gene set (CRG). We grouped them together with the Hi-C gene set (HiC) to define a new category: chromatin states based gene sets. We also integrated information related to transcription factor targets and microRNA targets from multiple data sources, such as the Plant Cistrome Database (38), AGRIS (76) and PNRD (78), to define another category: target gene sets.  

We defined a CoM gene set based on co-expression gene networks within the public resources. For the species such as maize and cotton, the CoM gene sets were directly downloaded from MCENet (12) and ccNET (11). For the species such as Arabidopsis and rice, we collected the coexpression gene network built by ATTED-II (79) and RiceFREDN (32) and identified the functional modules by CFinder (33) with standard parameters. In addition, we manually collected reference gene sets from published literatures, which then underwent curation and organization. We also grouped some gene sets related to novel functional categories, such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS), and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). These gene sets were manually collected from specific web servers and literatures (listed in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2).  

For some species, the collected gene sets might be got from different genome versions. We converted them to the unified ID system for the same species to allow curation, browse and analysis (Supplementary Table S3).  

# Functional category enrichment analysis  

In analysis page of PlantGSAD, users can submit a list of genes of interest for the enrichment analysis, and choose suitable categories from G1 to G9. Statistical tests and multiple test correction methods are provided. Three statistical tests are available for selection: hypergeometric test, Fisher’s exact test and chi-square test. The statistical formula for Fisher’s exact test, which is the default test, is presented in Equation (1):  

$$
\displaystyle\mathbf{P}=\frac{\binom{n}{k}\binom{N-n}{K-k}}{\binom{N}{K}}
$$  

where $N$ is the total number of genes in an organism or in the user-provided background, $n$ is the number of genes in the query list, $K$ is the total number of genes in one gene set and $k$ is the number of overlapping genes.  

We provide six multiple test correction methods: Yekutieli, Bonferroni, Hochberg, Benjamini-Hochberg (BH), Hommel and Holm (34). Adjusted P-values are obtained after performing correction for the false discovery rate (FDR), with the significantly enriched gene sets for each gene set category displayed using a cut-off selection.  

# SEACOMPARE and custom SEA  

Users can compare two or more SEA results using the SEACOMPARE tool, with a heatmap showing the common or unique significant gene sets. The color indicates the Pvalue or FDR. The custom SEA is independent of species and shares the same principle as functional category enrichment analysis. To use this custom tool, users need to prepare background datasets consisting of genes and their related gene sets. If the parent-child relationships between gene sets are submitted, the genes in the child gene sets belong to the parent gene sets by default during the enrichment computation. DAG (direct acyclic graph) graphs are also created as part of the results.

# Database implementation  

PlantGSAD was constructed on a standard LAMP (Linux $^+$ Apache $^+$ MySQL $^+$ PHP/Python) system. The data sets are stored in MySQL (www.mysql.com) and formatted text files, analysis codes were compiled using Python (www.python.org), and the web interface was built using PHP scripts (www.php.net) on Red Hat Linux powered by an Apache server (www.apache.org). No software or plugins are needed because the PlantGSAD tools are web-based. Users are free to access the database and there are no login requirements.  

# RESULTS  

# Gene set annotation and organization  

The accumulation of multidimensional omics data and the emergence of new types of data prompted us to collect a large volume of data for various species. The resulting PlantGSAD is capable of annotating gene sets for multiple assay types, including omics data sets generated from highthroughput transcriptomics and epigenomics experiments. PlantGSAD supports 44 species across nine functional categories, including GO (G1), other ontology (G2), pathway (G3), gene family-based (G4), chromatin states-based (G5), target (G6), CoM-based (G7), reference (G8), and new type (G9) gene sets (Figure 1D and Table 1).  

The number of defined gene sets is currently 236 007, covering a range of data types from public databases and manually collected literature data (Supplementary Table S2). In addition to GO, the ontology systems have been expanded to include PO, TO, and Plant Experimental Conditions Ontology (PECO), which allows the further annotation of gene sets (26). TO gene sets contain information on the agronomic traits of crops. The GO and other ontology categories are particularly useful for geneticists, biologists, and breeders when investigating the potential molecular mechanisms associated with target genes (35).

The query gene list for 44 plant species can be input for enrichment analysis (left). Individual gene set categories can be selected (right). (E) Enrichment analysis results can be visualized using table, overlap matrix, and DAG tree.  

For the pathway gene sets, we integrated the KEGG, PlantCyc and MapMan gene sets. MapMan was specifically designed to cover plant-specific pathways and processes (36). We also introduced a number of gene family gene sets, including the EAR motif-related gene family and chromatin associated factors. EAR motif-containing proteins, which are highly conserved transcription repressors across a diverse range of plant species, can interact with corepressors, affecting the structure of chromatin via histone modifications, thus repressing gene transcription and playing a role in hormone signal transduction, stress responses, and development (37). For this reason, the EAR subcategory was classified as a pivotal gene family in PlantGSAD. Co-expression networks have emerged as an efficient way to decipher the potential function of genes. We obtained 14 220 CoMs across 10 organisms for PlantGSAD as a functional category. Every CoM was defined as a gene set. CoMs provide basic annotated information to describe the complex roles of gene sets at the transcriptomic level. The complex signaling networks associated with transcriptional changes during developmental stages and responding to environmental cues often involve many related transcription factors (TFs). Thus, transcriptional factor targets (TFTs) were classified as a subtype of target gene sets in PlantGSAD to provide a framework for understanding the regulation mechanisms during plant development processes and stress responses. A large number of gene sets for this functional subcategory were collected for PlantGSAD. For example, we integrated 608 Arabidopsis gene sets mainly acquired from DAP-seq (38) and 115 maize TFT data sets primarily obtained from ChIP-seq (39). These TFT data sets in PlantGSAD can be used to investigate query genes involved in complex transcription regulatory networks, providing a valuable genome annotation resource for identifying potential key TFs that transcriptionally regulate the biological processes involving the query genes. Epigenomic data represents vital information in investigating the dynamic role of chromatin states in gene regulation, notably the linear partitioned genome segments with various epigenetic features localized in unannotated regions (31,40). Thus, we added chromatin state-based gene sets as an essential functional category in PlantGSAD. The increase in the functional categories related to chromatin states is beneficial for increasing the biological understanding of various epichromatin states during developmental processes and in response to environmental cues, and their subsequent differences in transcriptional regulation. Corresponding epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, post-translational histone modifications, and chromatin associated factors, are highly dynamic, with the changes in the chromatin states representing distinct epigenetic and spatial features of various transcriptional activities. The chromatin architectural capture technique Hi-C has been widely employed in the characterization of chromatin architecture in various plant and animal model species, leading to the definition of various chromatin architectural features, such as the chromosome territory, compartment ${\bf A}/{\bf B}$ , topological associated domains (TADs), and chromatin loops (41). Hence, chromatin states based gene sets were added as a functional category in PlantGSAD, consisting of four subgroups: Sta (defined chromatin states) from the PCSD database, ERG (epigenetic mark related), CRG (chromatin associated factor related), and HiC (Hi-C technology based) gene sets. Every defined chromatin state in a specific species touches on some preferential epigenetic marks in preferentially located regions. The same chromatin state has genes with similar epigenetic marks in similar regions of the genes, which might jointly participate in the transcription regulation of cellular activities. In addition, the information about genome-wide chromosome conformation capture can help to identify genes related to the assembly and conformational changes of chromatin.  

Reference gene sets were also curated, organized, and integrated from public research information, especially up to 1636 manually collected reference gene sets for Arabidopsis. We also introduced more novel functional categories to PlantGSAD to better serve the needs of biologists from different research areas. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) has been extensively employed to study cell-specific gene expression in animals and plants. The genes from distinct subpopulations and rare cell types of plants, such as putative quiescent center cells, have been included for the gene set annotation. As a critical component of chromatin compartmentalization, LLPS drives the formation of miscellaneous membrane-less compartments in cells and is involved in 3D chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation. Due to the fact that LLPS is associated with chromatin compartmentalization in transcriptional regulation, we integrated the LLPS-related proteins and included related gene sets in a functional sub-category. In the process of post-transcriptional regulation, RBPs are indispensable chaperones that naturally bind to RNA via one or multiple globular RNA-binding domains, changing the function and/or fate of the bound RNAs (42–46). Because RBPs are critical components in adjusting global cellular transcript levels via the binding to and potential regulation of the transcripts, we collected these proteins as a novel gene set type. PlantGSAD contains cereal crops, economic crops, and medicinal plants, etc. In particular, it includes vegetable and oilseed crops in the Brassicaceae family and major cereal crops within the Poaceae (grass) family. In PlantGSAD, the annotations from collected gene sets cover all of the genes in the Brassicaceae species Arabidopsis and the Poaceae species Oryza Sativa (rice), while the annotation rate for maize (Zea Mays) genes has reached over 99 percent. In addition, soybean (Glycine max L.) in Fabaceae produces high-quality oil from seeds, so functional annotations of the genes involved in the soybean acyl-lipid pathway have been collected and grouped into the lipid metabolism enzymes (LIP) subcategory. Medicinal plants have also attracted significant research attention (for example, Catharanthus roseus has been shown to produce anti-cancer agents), thus we collected CoM data sets of $C.$ roseus from CroFDB database (47) for use in PlantGSAD.  

The large number and the wide range of gene sets from plant species in PlantGSAD will significantly enhance the biological interpretation of genes of interest and cover a large range of unknown genes.  

# Gene set query and access  

All of the gene sets from the 44 plant species can be easily accessed and checked individually using the free selection of categories and species on the browse page of PlantGSAD (Figure 1). The name, type, species, and annotations for these gene sets are presented and the name of the gene set links to a details page for more information (Figure 1A). Rice gene LOC Os02g47280 (OsGRF4, growth-regulating factor 4) is used as an example for the search function in the PlantGSAD (Figure 1A). The search tools help users to conveniently retrieve the detailed information of collected gene sets and their constituent genes, and up to 30 genes can be searched for at the same time. A keyword-based search is provided for the gene sets (Figure 1B, C). The detailed annotations for the gene sets or individual genes serve as important selection criteria when choosing candidates for follow-up studies.  

Furthermore, GSEA analysis is available in the background of all gene sets in PlantGSAD, so the query gene list can be annotated using the enriched gene sets (Figure 1D). The direct visualization of the GSEA output report is convenient for analyzing the relevant biological knowledge (Figure 1E). PlantGSAD is also capable of analyzing query lists of genes from one or more functional categories, and the GSEA results are presented clearly in a series of tables. The database provides a summary head in the result page highlighting the significant results in each category and presenting a link to the corresponding analysis table. For ontological analyses (e.g. PO and TO), we integrated visualization features (e.g. DAG) to intuitively reflect the parentchild relationships. DAGs highlight the essential and meaningful terms from the raw and partially redundant enrichment results, allowing researchers to better understand the nature of the causal relationships involved. Furthermore, the significance levels of the terms in the DAGs are directly indicated using a color range from light yellow to dark red.  

# Additional assistant tools for analysis  

Several tools can be implemented into PlantGSAD to improve the efficiency of the analysis. Custom SEA tools have been designed to adapt to individual user-defined data ranging from specific plants to animals or other organisms, thus providing a flexible strategy based on a customized background and the optional relationship of terms. If users provided a query list and customized background, they could gain GSEA results for their area of interest. DAG graphs determining the relationship between terms are also produced if a reference file for relationships is provided. Crosscomparison is also vital for interpreting the analysis results obtained from experiments involving multiple samples, such as time-series experiments (Figure 3). Users can submit three formats for SEACOMPARE analysis, including customized datasets, result tables from GSEA analyses, and multiple session/job IDs. All of these formats contain multiple numeric values from separate experiments. In addition, an ID conversion tool is available for some species in PlantGSAD.  

# Application of GSEA with rice OsGRF4 binding genes  

In this section, we present an example of the use of PlantGSAD for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of a gene list of interest to illustrate the features of the multiple functional categories in the database. Rice GROWTHREGULATING FACTOR 4 (OsGRF4) is a positive transcriptional regulator of multiple nitrogen-metabolism genes and coordinates carbon metabolism and growth (48). We utilized a group of target genes associated with OsGRF4 binding peaks identified in a ChIP-seq experiment (48) as a query gene list for GSEA. The OsGRF4 binding peaks cover 387 genes spreading all over the 12 chromosomes of rice (Figure 2A). GSEA was initially conducted with these 387 genes. Gene sets from the GO, TO, PECO, metabolic pathways, and chromatin states categories were significantly enriched.  

In the GO (G1) category, there were some enriched biological processes related to key nitrogen-assimilation enzymes (Figure 2B), such as nitrate assimilation (related to assimilation), glutamine family amino acid biosynthetic process, and glutamine biosynthetic process (related to assimilation), which were confirmed by the enrichment analysis results derived from agriGOv2 (Supplementary Table S4). In the TO category, a number of agronomic traits were enriched, especially plant growth and development trait, grain number and grain yield trait (Figure 2C). The pathways such as nitrate reduction II (assimilatory), Nitrogen metabolism, PS.lightreaction were also enriched (Figure 2D). In particular, the enrichment of PS.lightreaction indicated that these query genes had effects on photosynthesis and carbon-assimilation. The GO and TO gene set enrichment analysis results indicated that OsGRF4 regulates downstream genes and coordinates both nitrogen and carbon assimilation, which is consistent with previous research that has reported that OsGRF4 is a positive regulator of plant carbon and nitrogen metabolism, photosynthesis, maintaining the C:N ratio, and promoting plant growth and development (48).  

Interestingly, in the analysis of chromatin states based gene sets, we found that CENH3-related and H3K27me3- related genes were significantly enriched (Supplementary Table S4). This may be related to the recently reported enhancement of the sustainable green revolution yield via nitrogen-responsive chromatin modulation in rice (49). NITROGEN-MEDIATED TILLER GROWTH RESPONSE 5 (NGR5) interacts with a component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and alters the H3K27me3 pattern response to changes in nitrogen availability. There exists a genetic interaction between GRF4 and NGR5, and the accumulation of these proteins can improve the yield and nitrogen-use efficiency of main rice varieties under reduced nitrogen fertilizer loadings (49). Thus, our enrichment analysis results for chromatin states-based gene sets suggest that OsGRF4 might regulate downstream genes via the NGR5-dependent recruitment of PRC2 and the reprogramming of H3K27me3 methylation.  

We then conducted overlap matrix analysis for the enriched gene sets to isolate the related essential genes (Figure 2E). These included SLR1 (50,51), sd1 (52,53), OsNRT1.1B (54), OsNRT2.3a (55), OsWUS, OsBZR1 (56), OsGS1.1, OsGS1.2, OsGS2 (57) and OsCDPK1 (58,59). These genes physically interact with the rice GRF4 and DELLA protein SLR1 to modulate plant growth and metabolic coregulation. Moreover, $O s N R T I.I B$ and OsNRT2.3a encode uptake transporters, and sd1 and OsBZR1 conferred semidwarf leads to GRV resistance to yield-reducing lodging (i.e. the flattening of plants by the wind and rain).

(C) Enriched pathways from the GSEA results. (D) DAG for the enriched TO terms with a cutoff FDR of 0.001. (E) Overlap matrix for GO-, TO-, pathway- and chromatin state-related gene sets. (F) Overview of GRF4 function.  

Finally, we summarized known and unknown GRF4 functions from published papers (Figure 2F). Using GSEA in PlantGSAD and follow-up prediction, it was shown that GRF4 not only promotes nitrogen assimilation, carbon fixation, plant height, and grain yield and growth, but also takes part in the response to abiotic stress and other predicted biological processes. In addition, the target genes for OsGRF4 are possibly involved in H3K27me3 histone modification.  

The above functional analysis results demonstrated that PlantGSAD is a powerful online database with a large gene set coverage and multiple visual graph tools for the enrichment analysis of functional categories.  

# Application of SEACOMPARE tool  

In PlantGSAD, several singular enrichment analysis (SEA) results from different samples can be compared using the SEACOMPARE tools. We thus investigated dynamic changes in chromatin states and the epigenetic and transcriptional regulators of up-regulated genes under cold treatment with time series in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (60). The numbers of gene associated with cold treatment of 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12 and $24\mathrm{~h~}$ were 302, 594, 768, 1055, 1214 and 1205, respectively (Figure 3A and Supplementary Table S5). Using enrichment analysis of chromatin state and TFT gene sets, the temporally dynamic response to cold stress at the epigenetic (Figure 3B, C) and transcriptional level (Figure 3D) was determined.  

For convenience, we describe here only a selection of the gene sets from the chromatin, ERG and TFT categories (complete SEA comparison results are presented in Supplementary Table S6). Intriguingly, the STATES 11, 12, 14 and 15, mainly corresponding to the repressed epigenetic mark H3K27me3, were enriched for the up-regulated genes at the early stage of treatment (0.5 h). Over time, however, STATES 17, 18, and 19 became enriched (1-24 h), followed by STATES 16, 20 and 21 (i.e. 3, 6, 12 and $24\ \mathrm{h}$ ). The SEACOMPARE results indicate that the genes modified with the repressed epigenetic mark $\mathrm{H}3\mathrm{K}27\mathrm{me}3$ tend to function at the beginning, followed by genes with the accessible regions. In the ERG category, the STATES 27, 26 and 22 conformed to genes with H3K4 tri-methylation or dimethylation modifications. STATES 22-24 and 2 are mainly associated with histone acetylation. After $24\mathrm{h}$ of cold treatment, the STATES 7 and 3-4 were significantly enriched; these were associated with H3K4me1 and H3K36me3 modification (Figure 3B, C).  

The SEACOMPARE results for the TFT subcategory showed that, among the genes induced by 1 h of cold treatment, there was an enrichment in the binding sites for CALMODULIN-BINDING TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVATOR 1 (CAMTA1). Previous studies (61,62) have suggested that CAMTA1 and CAMTA2 work in concert with CAMTA3 at low temperature $(4^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$ to increase the transcript levels of CRT/DRE BINDING FACTOR (CBF) genes after $^{2\mathrm{~h~}}$ . The key regulatory CBF pathway confers freezing tolerance in Arabidopsis and other plants (63,64). Our SEACOMPARE results showed that the targets of CBF1, CBF2 and CBF3 were enriched after from $\bar{3}\mathrm{~h~}$ of cold treatment (Figure 3D). Interestingly, the enrichment of target genes of CBFs reached a maximum level at ${\sim}24$ h. In addition, several other transcription factors, such as BZIPs, ANACs, and WRKYs may contribute to genes induced at 0.5-24 h cold treatment to enhance tolerance to freezing. For example, WRKY6 has been reported to positively regulate freezing tolerance (65).  

Overall, using SEACOMPARE tool on of chromatin states, ERGs and TFTs, the temporally dynamic regulation changes of genes and their progressive waves of transcriptional responses during cold stress were able to be monitored. Thus, this tool allows users to quickly and efficiently decipher the dynamic changes in regulation and biological processes during different developmental stages and in relation to stress responses over time.  

# DISCUSSION  

The emergence of numerous novel data types and highthroughput data sets for plant species over recent years has raised the urgent need to comprehensively integrate and effectively process annotated gene sets. The gene set annotation databases for human and model species PAGED (22) and GeneSetDB (23) were published in 2012, and the platforms DAVID (2,66), MSigDB (5), and WebGestalt (6) offer some functional categories for gene sets. However, they primarily focus on the gene-set annotation for human and model species, and there are a very limited number of plant species in these platforms. Therefore, we created PlantGSAD, a comprehensive gene set annotation database for multiple plant species. PlantGSAD integrates 236 007 gene sets across nine different categories for 44 plant species, consisting primarily of cereal crops, economic crops, and medicinal plants. Compared with other platforms, PlantGSAD covers a more comprehensive range of categories, including chromatin states based gene sets (G5) and new type gene sets (G9) such as LLPS and scRNA-seq gene sets. In addition, PO, TO and other plant-related categories are available in PlantGSAD, increasing the annotating possibilities.  

In PlantGSAD, we provide the basic GSEA, which is a powerful functional analysis method for interpreting the biological meaning of a group of genes. We originally developed the web-based PlantGSEA (7) in 2013, which has a user-friendly interface and a performance-efficient framework. We adapted the original GSEA tools from PlantGSEA for use in PlantGSAD, while several new tools were also developed to improve the analytical efficiency, including DAG for ontology categories, SEACOMPARE, and custom SEA. The DAGs intuitively reflect the parent-child relationships in ontology analysis, while SEACOMPARE was developed to allow the cross-comparison of SEA results. The present paper presented an example of this tool being used to investigate the dynamic changes in chromatin states and transcription regulation from time-series transcriptomic data during cold stress in Arabidopsis. The custom SEA tool was established to process individual userdefined data on a customized background and the optional relationship of gene sets.

Figure 3. SEACOMPARE analysis of GSEA results for the up-regulated gene list after a 0.5-, 1-, 3-, 6-, 12- or $24\mathrm{-h}$ of cold treatment in Arabidopsis thaliana. (A) Number of up-regulated genes after a 0.5-, 1-, 3-, 6-, 12- or 24-h of cold treatment in A. thaliana. (B-D) SEACOMPARE analysis of GSEA results for chromatin states (Sta), epigenetic mark related (ERG), and transcription factor targets (TFT) gene sets. The columns present, from left to right, the subcategory, gene set name, and a heatmap (columns 3–9). The Sta subcategory has two additional annotated columns for preferential epigenetics (right). The colored blocks in the heatmap represent the level of significance for each term. Moving from yellow to red indicates a movement from low to high significance; grey indicates not significant.  

It is important to note that PlantGSAD has some limitations and room for improvement. In particular, there are plans to add more gene sets, data types, species, visualizations, and tools. We will increase the types of gene sets for the supported species from the published literatures and new databases. For example, Li et al. (67) recently reported a high-resolution cell atlas for the xylem in Populus using scRNA-seq, which has already been added to our database as a key ScR gene set for Populus. We plan to routinely update the genome version of the available plant species around every six months. We also plan to add gene sets for new plant species in PlantGSAD, and this process may take longer time due to the accumulation of various types of gene sets from different resources. Furthermore, we have set up the custom SEA tool to satisfy the urgent requirements for the data types or the species that were not included in the existing data sets.  

In PlantGSAD, the large number and the wide variety of gene sets from multiple species, together with the highefficiency analysis tools and visualization features, greatly assist the biological interpretation of genes of interest in plants. We believe that the multidimensional plant gene annotations in PlantGSAD can be used to conveniently interpret the biological meaning of a gene via its connectivity and relationships, thus it represents a promising multifunctional platform for the functional analysis of plant genes.

# Introduction  

Five decades after the first dynamics of folded proteins were obtained (1 , molecular dynamics (MD) has become the cornerstone of biomolecular simulations, being heavily used in a wide range of fields, including biophysics, structural biology biochemistry enzymology pharmacology molecular biology and even virology and cellular biology (2 3 . Software and hardware improvements have continuously increased the size of the systems considered and the length of the trajectories collected (4–8 . The picosecond-long trajectories of systems containing a few thousand atoms obtained in the 1970s have led to millisecond-long trajectories on systems containing millions of atoms (9–12 . These technical improvements, combined with continuous refinements of force fields (FFs) (13–15 , have convinced a large community of biologists and chemists of the predictive power of MD simulations. In this context, ncreased interest has led to a dramatic growth in the number of trajectory producers and a ‘deluge of data’ that is impossible to manage with current standards (16 .  

For decades, the MD field has worked using a pragmatic approach: trajectories are collected and analyzed by a group, which, after a few months, erases them considering that if the trajectory were to be needed again then it could be rerun at a future date. No data are shared with the rest of the community and some simulations are repeated hundreds of times under identical conditions by different groups (sometimes even by the same one). Computer resources are wasted, data are not subjected to post-processing in search of additional information, learning from trajectories to improve FFs becomes impossible, and meta-analysis seeking to obtain information from a set of systems sharing common characteristics cannot be performed. In summary, and in the context of data management, the MD community should move to a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) model that is transversally implemented in all fields of the biosciences.  

Early initiatives to store MD data in a reusable format started a decade ago. These were focused on proteins and aimed to cover a representative subset of the PDB to obtain a pan-proteome description of protein dynamics (17–19 . A few family-specific databases have since been developed (20– 22 , and some initiatives have focused on DNA (23 24 . All these databases store coordinates—typically without the associated metadata—mainly obtained with a single MD engine by the same group developing the database. They offer the final user a limited set of predefined analyses through a rigid web-graphical nterface. Most of hese databases were created assuming Markovian ensembles, i.e. single trajectories, and only a few of them allow the generation of meta-trajectories by combining ndividual rajectories or he same system 23 . While these pioneering efforts have shown the community the potential and power of storing MD trajectories, they do not provide a solution for managing the information gathered from last-generation MD simulations. New platforms should be prepared for huge systems and non-Markovian ensembles, should implant system-specific analysis and should face the need or more flexible and ailored analyses rom he final user. Here we present a new paradigm for MD database generation. We demonstrate its power in a new database comprising trajectories obtained by dozens of groups in the context of the effort to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of submitting this paper, the database contains ${\sim}10^{4}$ (and still growing) trajectories, including classical single trajectories, replica exchange, massive parallel simulations, Markov State Models, biased rajectories, etc. The analyses are ailored for the simulated system, and the user has complete programmatic access to data to perform new on-demand analysis. Developed within the EU MDDB project (https://mddbr.eu/#/ , the server is accessible at https://bioexcel-cv19.bsc.es/#/  It is free and open to all users and there are no login requirements. It is also integrated into the simulations section of the BioExcel-MolSSI COVID-19 Molecular Structure and Therapeutics Hub  https://covid.molssi.org/simulations/ linked to the EU BioExcel project.  

# Database design and implementation  

Contrary to previous initiatives (17 23 25 26  that distribute the trajectories and associated files in different databases or a combination of files and databases, here we use a single database model based on MongoDB technology (https: //www.mongodb.org  to store (in the case of the present BioExcel COVID-19 database) 6 MongoDB collections (Figure 1 , namely Projects, Topologies, Analyses, Trajectories, SeqRef and StructRef. Note that to gain efficient data access and retrieval in the document-based structure of MongoDB, the raw trajectory is converted into an in-house binary format (Supplementary Figure S1).  

The MongoDB distributed database is deployed in the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), using an Open Nebula private cloud infrastructure. The current COVID19 database uses 18 Virtual Machines (VMs), each of them with a local 6 TB disk, configured as a combination of three replication machines (i.e. mirroring data services), each containing six shards (i.e. distributed data servers). Data are split across multiple instances (shards), and each shard is cloned in different machines (replicas). This scheme offers load balancing, thereby distributing a batch of tasks over the set of available resources, and it allows for parallelized data processing, ultimately enhancing the efficiency of the overall processing. The current database has a total capacity of $108\mathrm{\TB}$ (extendable easily to up to $300~\mathrm{TB},$ . The server portal is also implemented on top of a VM deployed in the same private cloud, allowing direct and efficient connection to the database using the Node.js MongoDB driver. Interestingly, the database system can grow easily to incorporate other databases following the same infrastructure model.  

# Data overview  

The BioExcel COVID-19 database is populated with MD trajectories from dozens of simulation groups around the world that used a variety of MD engines. The current database is populated mainly by the following: (i) COVID-19 Molecular Structure and Therapeutics Hub (https://covid.bioexcel. eu/simulations/ ; (ii) CHARMM-GUI Archive—COVID-19 Proteins Library (https://charmm-gui.org/?doc $\mathbf{\sigma}=\mathbf{\sigma}$ archive&lib= covid19 ; (iii) Amaro Lab COVID-19 Data set (https:// amarolab.ucsd.edu/covid19.php ; (iv) ‘in-house’ MD simulations and (v) data directly provided by colleagues. All these databases are monitored continuously to identify new entries to transfer and analyze.  

As of August 2023, the database contains $>10\mathrm{K}$ MD simulations, with an accumulated time of $12.7~\mathrm{ms}$ , and covering the following 11 SARS-CoV-2 protein units: Spike; Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2); Receptor Binding Domain (RBD); RBD-ACE2 complex; 3C-like protease (3CLpro); Papain-like Protease (PLPro); polymerase; NonStructural Proteins (NSP); nucleoproteins; membrane proteins; and other proteins (Figure 2 . The original simulation systems range from $20~000$ to $500~000$ atoms and individual trajectories from 20 ns to $100~\upmu\mathrm{{s}}$ , with the longest accumulated ensemble reaching the 10-millisecond scale (multiple replica simulations). Systems containing millions of atoms are currently being added to the database.  

The database incorporates traditional Markovian singletrajectories, as well as non-Markovian ensembles such as enhanced sampling simulations, biased simulations and multiple replica (from $5$ to ${>}5000$ ) simulations, some of them compressed into Markov State Models (see Supplementary Table S1).

# Data deposition  

The database is open to new simulations and is expected to grow through the addition of new information to be incorporated into the MDDB database infrastructure (https://mddbr. $\mathrm{eu}/)$ in the coming months. Deposited data can consist of one or several trajectories (collections) that fulfill a series of requirements:  

• Datasets should correspond to MD simulation trajectories of COVID-19-related proteins (e.g. SARS-CoV-2 main protease, Spike, ACE2, etc.), alone or complexed with proteins or small ligands.   
Dehydrated rajectories should be maged and ndividual frames superimposed. Trajectory can be split into multiple files if necessary. Accepted formats are explained in the Analysis Pipeline $\&$ Database Loader section below.   
Trajectories should be accompanied by a topology file (PDB files are acceptable). The BioExcel COVID-19 internal workflow uses a collection of biomolecular tools for handling trajectory and topology formats. Refer to the tool’s documentation for additional information.   
Submission should include a series of mandatory metadata items, but we encourage providing metadata covering the entire form (see BioExcel COVID-19 deposition form in the Appendix of the Supplementary Data).   
The data-providers are responsible for the quality of the deposited trajectory and should fulfill quality requirements shown in (Supplementary Table S2). Additionally, before deposition, the internal analysis pipeline checks the simulation for the following: (i) topology and trajectory coordinate matching; (ii) periodic boundary conditions or imaging problems; (iii) topology problems (e.g. incorrect number of bonds); iv) root mean square deviations RMSd, RMSd per residue, pairwise RMSd); v) radius of gyration (Rgyr); (vi) atomistic fluctuations; (vii) principal component analysis (PCA) and (viii) solventaccessible surface area (SASA). Future tests will be implemented as accepted by the community. Unusual behaviors (Supplementary Table S2) are communicated to the authors who should confirm if they were expected due to the type of simulation.   
• Datasets should ideally (but not mandatorily) be supported by a scientific publication or indexed document (e.g. zenodo). Publications in press or submitted are acceptable, with the possibility to keep data on hold until the publication is available.  

We would like to stress here the importance of data and metadata standards. Assessing he quality of he rajectories s not straightforward, especially when working with enhanced sampling or biased simulations. This quality check requires curated information about the simulation, and there is a clear need for a community effort to raise accepted validation metrics.  

# Analysis pipeline and database loader  

In addition to the analysis undertaken in the checking part, the system performs a series of analyses that are system-specific, in most cases proposed by the authors of the simulations (see below). The analyses are performed with a collection of biomolecular tools (Supplementary Table S3), integrated into a reproducible workflow available in GitLab: https://mmb.irbbarcelona.org/gitlab/d. beltran.anadon/MoDEL-workflow  The workflow accepts trajectory and topology formats written by the most popular MD engines (AMBER (27 , GROMACS (28 , NAMD (29 , OpenMM (30  and Desmond (31 ). New analyses are constantly being integrated. Note that programmatic access allows tailored analysis by the final user (see below).  

The set of analyses is uploaded into the database together with the trajectory data, topology and metadata information (Project, Topologies, Analyses and Trajectories collections, Figure 1 . Furthermore, the loader automatically retrieves data from external biological databases associated with the sequence/structure of interest, thereby extending the amount of accompanying nformation or each simulation SeqRef and StructRef collections, Figure 1 .  

# Programmatic access (REST API)  

All the information stored in the database can be accessed programmatically by a REST API: https://bioexcel-cv19.bsc. es/api/rest/docs/  which contains a collection of endpoints divided into the following six categories: project, references, topology, files, analyses and chains The endpoints allow a programmatic browse of the database, retrieval of information from the projects, and download of the simulation topology and trajectory. Most of the endpoints take the project accession code (persistent identifier) as input. The trajectory endpoint allows the extraction and download of MD trajectories from the database, with the possibility to specify a particular frame range and protein region. As an example, the atomistic coordinates of only the backbone atoms for a representative set of frames, say one every 10 frames, can be directly queried (Supplementary Figure S2). The trajectory is then automatically generated using the power of the noSQL MongoDB. A similar query can be made with the structure endpoint to generate a matching structure.  

To achieve interoperability between the life sciences and materials disciplines, an implementation of the BioExcel COVID-19 REST API has been developed and deployed, following the Open Databases Integration for Materials Design (OPTIMADE) specifications (https://bioexcel-cv19.bsc. es/optimade/ , which are he standard n material science 32 .  

# Meta-analyses  

The programmatic access above opens the door to metaanalysis that integrates several simulations. For demonstration purposes, a new section has been added to the interface (Meta-analyses), with a collection of Jupyter Notebooks showing the power of the REST API and how it can be used in combination with Python libraries to extract and graphically display information. The notebooks are also available from GitHub: https://github.com/bioexcel/ bioexcel_covid19_workflows  The first example analyzes a collection of 78 simulations of the binding of potential drug molecules to the ectodomain of human ACE2 protein from D.E. Shaw´s group. The workflow determines he drug-protein interaction profile for all the ligands, integrating the information to rank the drugs based on the strength of the interaction (Figure 3A) (see https://bioexcel-cv19.bsc.es/#/ d/ MCV1900103/energies for an example of Gentamicin-ACE2 drug-protein interaction energies). The final plots allow easy identification of the drug candidates with greater interaction (Figure 3A) and exploration of the protein residues that contribute most to the protein-drug binding interaction (Figure 3B). A second example analyses simulations of ACE2 protein interaction with SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD (Receptor Binding Domain) by M. Hongying Chen and coworkers and explores the impact of the N501Y mutation in different variants of the virus on ACE2-Spike binding 33 . Although differences n the average interaction energies are mild (Figure 3C), hydrogen bond nteractions with he residues surrounding he mutation are altered (Figure 3D). A last example uses a collection of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) simulations to study the interactions of the viral non-structural proteins 12 (NSP12), NSP8 and NSP7 with RNA (Figure 3E). Residues involved in the RNA recognition can be spotted from the interaction energies, which show that while no strong interactions occur with NSP7 and NSP8, strong interactions do take place between RNA and NSP12. The available notebook also exemplifies how to download a number of frames from one of the RdRp simulations and explores the dynamics of these residues through the NGL viewer (34 35 .

# Data portal  

Information stored in the database is accessible through a web-based portal, which offers an easy way to browse and query the data and presents the information in a graphical and interactive way. The interface is divided into sections: Browse/Search  Overview  Trajectory  Analyses and Downloads  

# Browse and search  

The whole collection of simulations included in the database are shown n he Browse section of he portal Figure 4A). Accession (persistent id), name of the simulation (short description), unit (Spike, RBD, ACE2, etc.) and available analyses are displayed by entry. The list can be easily filtered using the quick search orm at he op of he webpage, which queries he accession number, simulation name, description and author of the trajectory. The table can be also filtered by a particular protein or complex. Each entry displays a ist of available analyses, with a direct link to the specific results. The Search section allows the user to look for entries using the metadata on the simulation parameters, as well as annotations on the biological role of he protein and COVID-19 related nformation. This includes searches for variant name, sequence similarity, protein domains, shape of he starting conformation, presence of antibodies/nanobodies and Post Translational Modifications (PTM) (Figure 4B; and Supplementary Table S4). Besides, the possibility to search for organism, gene and protein function is also available, thanks to Uniprot data. Further searches will be implemented based on user’s demands. Database collections are indexed to optimize search queries.  

# Overview  

This section of the website presents information about the molecule of interest (Figure 4C). When available, the starting PDB codes are used to retrieve data from the PDB database (36 and ink o external databases such as Uniprot 37 , PDBe (38 39  and 3DBionotes (40 . Simulation metadata include a short description of he simulation, itle, method, authors, program, license and citation.  

# Trajectory  

This section shows the simulation using a powerful web component based on the NGL viewer (Figure 4D). The panel is directly connected to the database and it uses streaming technologies to display the trajectory snapshots as they are being transferred. For he purpose of visualization, a video s shown considering a reduced trajectory, with the possibility to select the number of frames. Regions of interest (specific domains, epitopes, residues that are mutated along virus evolution…) can be highlighted. The NGL viewer is highly customizable, with a hidden panel allowing modification of the default representations, the addition of new ones, or the adjustment of the trajectory playback settings and visualization properties (Figure 4E). A selection of the most important simulation parameters, essential for reproducibility purposes, are included just below the visualization panel (Figure 4F). Finally, families, domains and sites revealed by an InterProScan (41  analysis for each of the chain sequences are also presented (Figure 4G). The regions are mapped onto the chain sequences and linked to the NGL viewer to easily identify them on the structure.  

# Analyses  

The database contains a series of system-specific precomputed analyses (performed following feedback from the authors of he simulations; see Help pages of he server). Analyses are presented n ully nteractive plots, allowing zoom, nformation on hover and with connection to the NGL viewer, which opens specific frames or highlights specific residues. Analyses can be grouped into three categories (see Analysis Pipeline $\&$ Database Loader section): i) general geometrical analysis; ii) interactions; and iii) system-specific analyses. The first ones include global (RMSd, Rgyr, pairwise RMSd, PCA) and local (RMSd per residue, SASA) descriptors (Figure 5A– C). Interaction analyses include Poisson Boltzmann – classical molecular nteraction potentials estimate of nteraction energies (42 , as well as residue contacts and hydrogen bonds (Figure 5D, E). Finally, system-specific analyses show information considered essential by the authors of the simulations and they are specifically coupled to the molecule of interest. Examples of these analyses are Spike mutations or epitopes (Figure 5F, G), or the Markov State Model (MSM) centroids, population and transitions between them. Epitopes have been mined from experimental structures in the PDB, defining the SARS-CoV-2 interface residues as those being at less than 5 Ångstroms from the antibodies. MSM visualization is based on the states and transitions that the authors of the trajectory defined when possible, and is adjusted to a reduced number of states otherwise (e.g. using RMSd between macrostates as edges) (Figure 6 .  

# Downloads  

This section gives direct access to the topology and trajectory files. The PDB is used as topology format, while XTC (GROMACS (28 ) is the format used to keep the trajectory. Before incorporation into the database, the trajectory is processed PBC removed, solvent stripped), maintaining he original number of rames rom he uploaded original) simulation. All data used on the website are available to download in json format, hrough a ‘Data in this page  link at the top right corner of he screen, and are programmatically accessible hrough the REST API (see above).

# Conclusions  

As MD simulations increase in complexity and accuracy, the need for storing such simulations becomes clearer. Such storage is a requirement to not only guarantee the reproducibility of the results and the robustness of conclusions derived from he simulations but also o acilitate urther analysis and meta-analysis by the community. Tools to store trajectories and make them accessible to the MD community are required and should be adopted by the community in the same way as the structural biology community adopted the PDB. A nice example of a community effort was done in the context of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The processing, curating and sharing of hese data o acilitate proper analysis are as necessary as they are challenging. Several criteria to perform these steps have been discussed and applied to set up a new database as proof of concept. A new tool for researchers to easily access stored data, both programmatically and through visual interface, has also been developed. Although it is clear that maintaining a centralized infrastructure for MD simulations is not realistic, we believe this project will be the perfect prototype for new federated/distributed infrastructures, where compatible DB deployments will be connected by a central server, avoiding unnecessary data transfer. We expect BioExcel COVID-19 database to lay the groundwork for future MD databases.

# ABSTRACT  

ABC portal (http://abc.sklehabc.com) is a database and web portal containing 198 single-cell transcriptomic datasets of development, differentiation and disorder of blood/immune cells. All the datasets were re-annotated with a manually curated and unified single-cell reference, especially for the haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. ABC portal provides web-based interactive analysis modules, especially a comprehensive cell-cell communication analysis and disease-related gene signature analysis. Importantly, ABC portal allows customized sample selection based on a combination of several metadata for downstream analysis and comparison analysis across datasets. ABC portal also allows users to select multiple cell types for analysis in the modules. Together, ABC portal provides an interactive interface of single-cell data exploration and reanalysis with customized analysis modules for the researchers and clinicians, and will facilitate understanding of haematopoiesis and blood/immune disorders.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Blood/immune cells are involved in the normal and dysregulated functions of all human tissues. Haematopoiesis and blood/immune disorder research has been significantly driven by the breakthrough of single-cell technology (1,2). High-resolution discrimination of the haematopoiesis lineage and differentiation trajectories were discovered $\left(3-$ 8). The development of the haematopoietic system was meticulously depicted from fetus to adult (8,9), covering many haematopoietic lineages, such as haematopoietic stem cells (10–12), macrophages (13), dendritic cells (14– 16), megakaryocytes (17), innate lymphoid cells (18) and T cells (19). Meanwhile, heterogeneity of many types of blood/immune cells was further unveiled with single-cell sequencing, such as neutrophils (20), natural killer cells (21,22), T cells (23) and myeloid cells (24,25). On the other hand, novel cellular and regulatory mechanisms of blood disease progression and therapy have been revealed with single-cell analysis. It was demonstrated that the heterogeneous of malignant blood cells and stem cells underlie the disease initiation and progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (26,27), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (28), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) (29), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (30–32), aplastic anaemia (AA) (33,34), lymphoma (35), and multiple myeloma (MM) (36,37). Sub-cell-type specific drug response and resistance mechanisms were uncovered for AML (38), CLL (39) and MM (37,40–42). Together, the massive studies using singlecell methods become a large valuable resource for haematology and immunology research. The effective re-access and re-analysis of the resource will benefit the experimental researchers and clinicians with weak computational skills in the field of both haematology and immunology.  

Many general single-cell databases were developed, including Single Cell Portal (https://singlecell.broadinstitute. org/single cell) of Broad Institute, Single Cell Expression Atlas (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/sc/home) of EMBLEBI, SCPortalen, PanglaoDB, scRNASeqDB, SCDevDB, SC2disease, cancerSCEM and TISCH (43–49). BloodSpot is a database of gene expression of haematopoietic cells in bulk samples. It was updated with several singlecell/purified bulk datasets recently (50). However, a haematology specific, interactive re-analysis allowed database of single-cell transcriptome is still lacking. As non-solid tumor malignancies, blood cancer was seldom collected by cancer immune databases (47,49,51), due to the entanglement of the malignant cells and immune cells. In addition, lacking cell-type annotation of many downloaded datasets hinders the effective reuse of the published datasets.  

Here, we built ABC portal, a blood/immune cell specific database and tool with curated annotation for blood cell type, especially hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), at single-cell resolution. ABC portal provides four interactive modules for the exploration and analysis of gene expression, cellular composition, gene signatures and cell-cell communication. 111 datasets of haematopoiesis and development and 87 datasets of blood disease were collected, all of which passed through a uniform analysis pipeline. Curated cell type reference was generated from integrating four and six datasets for human and mouse, respectively. All the datasets in ABC were re-annotated uniformly by the two references, which facilitates cross-dataset comparison. More importantly, ABC allows the re-analysis of user-selected subsets of data in one dataset or comparison across datasets. Thus, ABC provides a comprehensive and professional database and tool for the haematology and immunology community.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Data collection  

We searched PubMed for the literature related to single-cell RNA-seq and haematology. The search query was ‘Search: ((‘single-cell RNA’) OR (scRNA-seq)) AND (hemato\* OR leukemia OR blood) AND (human OR mouse OR patient OR murine) NOT (review) filters: Associated data’. The literature was then manually confirmed if the data were publicly available. We downloaded the data from the Gene Expression Omnibus, ArrayExpress, FigShare (52) and Zendo (https://zenodo.org/). Through manually reviewing each literature and supplemental materials, we curated the meta-information of each dataset, including species, cancer type, technology, tissue source, flow cytometry gates and perturbations. Curated meta-information and processing steps of each dataset were elaborated in the database.  

# Data quality control and batch effect correction  

We downloaded the quantification matrix (count or TPM) of gene expression. If the quantification matrix is not available, we downloaded the raw FASTQ files and processed them with Cell Ranger 3.0.2. Cells with a total count of ${>}500$ , gene numbers ${>}200$ and a percentage of mitochondrial gene counts ${<}20\%$ were kept. Human genes were lifted over to hg38 and Ensembl v105, and mouse genes were lifted over to $\mathrm{mml}0$ and Ensembl v105 using biomaRt v2.38.0 (53). Each dataset was normalized and integrated across samples using Harmony v0.1.0 (54).  

# Reference generation  

Four datasets from Atlas of Human Blood Cells (ABC) (3), fetal bone marrow (8) and Human Cell Atlas (HCA) were integrated to generate the reference for human, including nine samples derived from fetal bone marrow, adult bone marrow and cord blood (Table S1). Six bone marrow datasets (4,5,55–57) were integrated to generate the reference for mouse (Table S1). Cell filter criteria for each dataset was shown in Table S1. DoubletFinder v2.0.3 (58) was used to remove doublets for 10X platform generated datasets. After quality control (Table S1), mitochondrial genes and genes expressed in $<10$ cells were removed. To integrate datasets, 2000 highly variable genes were selected for each sample by FindVariableFeatures from Seurat v3.1.1 (59,60)  

and 2000 highly variable genes were selected for each dataset and then total datasets by SelectIntegrationFeatures from Seurat. Datasets were integrated using Harmony v0.1.0 (54) with $50~\mathrm{PCs}$ to remove batch effects of samples and platforms.  

After integration, cells expressing two types of canonical marker genes were also removed as doublets. In detail, data were first clustered into ${>}200$ small clusters using Seurat with parameters ‘dims $=1{:}60$ , reduction $\c=$ ‘harmony’, $\mathrm{k.param}=10$ , resolution $=15^{,}$ . If any one of the canonical marker genes of a lineage (Table S2) was expressed in $550\%$ of cells ( $30\%$ for mouse) in a small cluster and its mean expression was more than a heuristic value, one-tenth of $99\%$ quantile of the marker gene expression level in all cells, the small cluster was tagged by the lineage. A small cluster with two types of lineage tags was recognized as a doublet cluster. Clusters expressed both $\mathrm{\DeltaT}$ and natural killer (NK) cell markers, both megakaryocyte and myeloid cell markers or both NK and myeloid cell markers were kept.  

Doublet removed datasets were roughly clustered by lineages and then each lineage was finely clustered by Seurat using Louvain algorithm. The cell type annotations were determined based on the marker genes of each cluster identified by Seurat and the original cell annotation from the publications. Cluster similarity and cell cycle were checked to confirm the cell clustering and cell-type annotation using function BuildClusterTree and CellCycleScoring from Seurat.  

# Cell type re-annotation  

Malignant cells were recognized using inferCNV v1.7.1 (61). Normal control samples in each dataset were used as the control for CNV recognition. If not available, randomly selected 2000 cells from the HCA bone marrow datasets (or mouse dataset (57)) in the reference were used as control. HLA genes and cell cycle-related genes (c5.all.v7.4.cyclegene from MSigDB (62)) were removed to exclude confounding segments. We used default parameters except for cutoff $=0.1$ (cutoff $\mathit{\Theta}=1$ for Smartseq/Smart-seq2 platforms) and scaled data $\mathbf{\Sigma}=\mathbf{\Sigma}$ FALSE (scaled data $={\mathrm{TRUE}}$ for samples using external control) to run inferCNV.  

To automate the malignant cell recognition, we clustered cells into five groups based on the CNV scores from inferCNV. For each group, the CNV scores were binarized, i.e. genes with the maximum or minimum CNV scores in each group were set to 1, and the rest scores were set to 0. In each group, genes with an averaged binary score of ${>}0.15$ were recognized as copy number changed genes. For a group with $550\%$ of cells, in which $95\%$ of genes were lowly expressed genes (total counts in all cells of the group ${<}2$ , we increased the averaged binary score cutoff to 0.6. Cells in a group with 15 continuous copy number changed genes were defined as malignant cells.  

The non-malignant cell types were re-annotated using scmap v1.4.1 (63) and the single-cell transcriptome reference generated as described above. scmapCluster mode of scmap was applied with the top 10 marker genes of each cell type in the reference dataset as feature genes and a similarity threshold of 0.4.  

# Score of signature gene set  

Score of a selected gene set in signature module were calculated using AUCell v1.4.1 (64).  

# Ligand–receptor network  

We built the ligand–receptor interaction network module, employing CellPhoneDB v2.0 (65) to predict the communications between cell types. Parameters of $\mathrm{\leftarrow}$ iterations $=1000$ –subsampling –subsampling-log false – subsampling-num-cells 1000 –threshold $0.01^{\circ}$ were used. The mean strength was normalized to the total strength predicted in each dataset at a user-defined p-value cutoff, then multiplexed by $10^{4}$ .  

# Web portal  

The front end of the server was developed with VueJS v2.6.0 (https://vuejs.org/) and ViewUI v4.0.0 (https://www. iviewui.com/), and the back end was built in Java using the SpringBoot web framework v2.1.13. The server is hosted on a Linux Centos v7.0.1406 server running Apache Tomcat v9.0.31. Files of the raw data matrix, pre-processed data and intermediate results were stored in the local Ext4 file system. Metadata and the analysis results were stored in MySQL v8.0.18 database, which enables more efficient querying, visualizing and archiving of the datasets and analysis results. The interactive visualization diagrams were implemented with the D3.js (https://d3js.org/), Echarts.js (https://echarts.apache.org/) and CanvasXpress.js (http:// canvasxpress.org/).  

# RESULTS  

# Scheme of ABC portal  

ABC portal currently contains 198 datasets from 150 publications and includes 12 blood disease types of human and mouse (Figure 1). We performed unified quality control, normalization and batch correction, and manually adjusted the meta-information for each dataset. Cell types of all datasets were re-annotated with the single-cell reference built in this study. We retained all types of cells in ABC database, including malignant cells and non-blood cells. Malignancy was labeled by implementing inferCNV (61) for the cancer datasets. ABC portal provides modules for gene expression, signature expression, cell composition and ligand-receptor network analysis (Figure 1). The label transfer, cell composition and ligand-receptor network were pre-calculated for each dataset, allowing fast access to the results in these modules. More importantly, users can select a subset of cells by metadata and/or cell types to perform these analyses and can compare across datasets.  

# Datasets in ABC portal  

There are 122 human and 76 mouse datasets in the database currently, and the source types mainly include bone marrow, PBMC, cord blood, fetal liver and others (Figure 2A and B). There are 111 normal haematopoiesis and 87 disease-related datasets (Figure 2C). The disease-related datasets consist of 12 blood disorder types and 26 datasets of inflammation, infections and other disease related to blood and immune cells. Lymphoma, MM, AML and ALL were the most frequently studied haematological malignancies (Figure 2C).The normal haematopoiesis datasets mainly come from the research of hematopoietic hierarchy and hematopoietic system development, covering different types of hematopoietic lineages (Figure 2D). Meanwhile, our database contains datasets derived from a variety of platforms (Figure 2E).  

# Reference datasets  

Out of total 198 datasets, 64 datasets have an original cell type annotation. To facilitate the reuse of the datasets, we provided a unified cell-type annotation for human and mouse datasets respectively in addition to their original annotations from publications. The unified annotation was label transferred from the single-cell transcriptome reference we built.  

For the human reference, we integrated three bone marrow (BM) samples from Atlas of Human Blood Cells (ABC) project (3), two fetal bone marrow (FBM) samples (8) and two BM and two cord blood (CB) samples from Human Cell Atlas (HCA) to generate the reference for human. The integrated reference was partitioned into 44 clusters, and the cell identity of the clusters was determined by combining two types of information (Figure 3A). First, the cell annotation from the literature of ABC dataset, HCA dataset and FBM dataset (Figure S1). Second, the expression of canonical marker genes (Figure 3A–B and Supplementary Figure S2A). Comparing the cellular composition of BM, CB and FBM (Supplementary Figure S2B), GMP was enriched in both BM and FBM, HSC was enriched in CB and adult BM (Figure 3D–E). CD14 monocyte1 was enriched in FBM, CD14 monocyte2 was enriched in CB and adult BM, ${\mathrm{CD}}16+$ monocyte was enriched in adult BM, and naı¨ve B and naı¨ve T cells were enriched in CB (Figure 3D–E and Supplementary Figure S2C–E).  

For the mouse reference, we integrated 30 samples from six bone marrow datasets to generate the reference, and hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were especially enriched in each dataset (4,5,55–57). The integrated reference was partitioned into 30 clusters and the cell identity of the clusters was determined by combining the cell annotation from the five literature and the expression of marker genes (Supplementary Figure S3A–C and Figure S4). The difference in cellular composition across the datasets were shown in Supplementary Figure S3D–E.  

The references were used to pre-annotate the datasets in ABC portal. Users can switch to the consensus cell-type annotation by the button on each dataset page.  

# Sample selection and filter function  

ABC portal allows dataset searching by species, tissue source, disease and publications (Figure 4A). An important feature of ABC portal is that dataset-specific filters and their combinations enable customized sample selection and re-analysis (Figure 4B). Dataset-specific filters can be selectively added using $^{6}+$ Add’ button (Figure 4B and C). Different combinations of sample filters, including tissue type,

patient phenotype, flow cytometry gating, and treatment, are restored and can be applied to all analysis modules (Figure 4D). For instance, users can select flow cytometry sorted $\mathrm{CD45+}$ cells from B-ALL samples for subsequent analysis and comparison (Figure 4B). In addition, metadata of each cell are provided in the ‘Metainfo’ tab and steps of data preprocessing are recorded in the ‘Process’ tab (Figure 4D).  

# Application modules  

There are four interactive and user-friendly analysis modules developed in ABC portal.  

UMAP module. This module contains two exploration functions (Figure 5A). One function is the multi-level cell annotation, including original sample information, original cell type annotation (if available), unified cell-type annotation and malignancy (Figure 5B). Users can switch easily between original and unified annotations with a slider button (Figure 4B). Specially, we provide a switch button to show the possible cell type of malignant cells, which allows users to explore the characteristics and heterogeneity of malignant cells (Figure 5B). For example, it’s shown that the malignant cells in B-ALL samples were mostly pre-proB and pro-B cells (Figure 5C). The other function is the gene expression visualization by both UMAP and violin plot (Figure 5D and E). For instance, DNTT, a marker gene of B progenitor cell, was highly expressed in the malignant cells in GSE153697 dataset (Figure 5D). These results confirmed the accuracy of cell type and malignant cell annotation. Gene expression can also be compared across samples for a given cell type, across cell types or across malignancy (Figure 5E and Supplementary Figure S5A).

(D) Number of datasets from healthy conditions summarized by lineage. (E) Dataset summary by sequencing platforms.  

Composition module. The module shows the cellular composition in each sample or each patient (Figure S5B). The cross-sample difference in cellular composition can be compared. For example, in GSE130116 dataset, the proportion of myeloid cells including monocyte and dendritic cell in healthy samples is higher than those in primary B-ALL patients at the diagnosis stage, whereas the proportion of T/NK cells in patients is higher than in healthy samples.  

These are consistent with the results reported in the original publication (29) (Supplementary Figure S5B).  

Signature expression module. This module displays the scaled expression of genes in selected signatures and the AUCell score of the selected gene set. Besides the canonical gene sets, we collected 15 blood disorder-related gene sets from the literature to facilitate users’ analysis, such as ‘AML LSC $^+$ gene’ signature (Figure 6A). This module allows the comparison of signature expression either across patients in a selected cell type or across cell types, indicating the signature variance across patients or the signature enrichment across cell types (Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure S5C). For example, the expression of ‘AML LSC $^+$ gene’ genes across cell types in AML samples shows the leukemia stem cell related genes were expressed highly in HSC/MPP, LMPP and GMP (Figure 6B). Using this module, we also found that the gene expression of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway in yolk sac MK cells was higher than that in the fetal liver in GSE144024 dataset, which is consistent with the result reported in the original article (17) (Supplementary Figure S5C).

Ligand-receptor network module. The ‘LR network’ module exhibits the predicted ligand-receptor network of selected cell types (Figure 6C). There are three levels of LR analysis in this module: LR network, LR pair strength and LR gene expression. For ‘LR network’, users can customize and explore the LR network by filtering edge strength or changing network layout (Figure 6C and D). For ‘LR pair strength’, users can explore the strength of LR interaction pairs between a selected cell type and other cell types by switching the analysis type (Figure 6E and Supplementary Figure S5D). The interaction pairs are oriented from ligands to receptors and the strength plots are separated into two by the orientation. Finally, ‘LR gene expression’ exhibits the expression levels of the ligand and receptor genes. For example, LR network showed that malignant cells tend to interact with CD14 and CD16 monocytes in GSE161801 dataset, and LR pairs LILRA4-BST2, C5AR1-RPS19, CD74-MIF, LAIR1- LILRB4, CCL4-GPRC5D, TNFRSF17-TNFSF13B and ICAM1-AREG mediated the communication as reported (41). In addition, more interactions, such as GPR37-PSAP and CCL5-CCR1 that were not reported, were also discovered with the analysis and may be worth further study.  

# Comparison across datasets  

ABC portal provides a convenient utility for cross-dataset comparison. Under the ‘Compare’ page, users can select multiple datasets to compare cell composition and gene expression across samples (Figure 7A and B). Cell counts and fractions for each cell type in each sample can be compared and be highlighted across samples (Figure 7C). Plot of standard deviation versus mean cell fraction indicates the highly variable cell types across samples. Gene expression can be compared across samples in a cell type of interest (Figure 7D). $P$ value of Kruskal–Wallis test is shown to indicate the significance of difference.  

# DISCUSSION  

Many single-cell databases were developed to collect various types of single-cell datasets. However, a blood/immune cell specific single-cell database with uniform cell type annotation and analysis utilities is not available. Here, we developed ABC portal, a comprehensive blood/immune singlecell data portal with meticulous cell annotation for researchers to explore and re-analyze the data. There are three special features of ABC. First, ABC is a blood/immune cell specific database with refined cell type annotation and manual curation. Second, ABC provides interactive analysis modules for data re-analyze, especially the cell-cell communication module. Third, ABC allows comparison between datasets and analysis of selected sample subsets.  

In addition, as an important project of the consortium of Atlas of Blood Cells, ABC portal will be kept updating. In the future, ABC will integrate other single-cell omics data, such as scATAC-seq, protein data of CITE-seq and scDNA-seq. More analysis modules will be launched. In conclusion, ABC portal is a valuable resource and web tool for researchers to investigate haematopoiesis, blood disease and immunology.

# Abstract  

The UNIfied database of TransMembrane Proteins (UniTmp) is a comprehensive and freely accessible resource of transmembrane protein structural nformation at different evels, rom ocalization of protein segments, hrough he opology of he protein o he membrane-embedded 3D structure. We not only annotated tens of thousands of new structures and experiments, but we also developed a new system that can serve hese esources n parallel. UniTmp s a unified platform hat merges TOPDB Topology Data Bank of Transmembrane P oteins), TOPDOM (database of conservatively located domains and motifs in proteins), PDBTM (Protein Data Bank of Transmembrane Proteins) and HTP (Human Transmembrane Proteome) databases and provides nteroperability between he ncorporated esources and an easy way o keep hem egularly updated. The current update contains 9235 membrane-embedded structures, 9088 sequences with 536 035 topology-annotated segments and 8692 conservatively localized protein domains or motifs as well as 5466 annotated human transmembrane proteins. The UniTmp database can be accessed at https://www.unitmp.org.

# Introduction  

Transmembrane proteins (TMP) play an important role in iving cells, as hey serve as a gatekeeper or cellular communication and transport of molecules across the membranes. They participate in cell signaling, maintaining cell structure and energy production. Despite their importance, their structure determination is rather laborious due to their hydrophobic nature, which needs to be retained in the lipid environment.  

Numerous efforts were made to explore the uncharted space of membrane protein structures. By the end of the 90s, the majority of experimental nformation could be nterpreted as topological data (e.g. he cellular compartment localization of a ew residues, or sometimes he orientation of a onger connecting loop/ ail region was defined (1 2  with a few revealed structures). n the 2000s structure determination yielded hundreds of mportant novel structures, meanwhile, structural genomic target selection projects aimed to pinpoint ‘important’ proteins that drove the field forward (3 4 . Although cryoelectron microscopy boosted he number of solved TMP structures (5 , they still lag far behind globular proteins in terms of structure determination. Not surprisingly considering the challenging experimental conditions, he next big step arrived with Artificial Intelligence (AI): AlphaFold2 (6  ‘solved’ the problem of predicting all structures, yet around one-third of the predicted) human membrane proteome still has quality ssues (7 8 . The potential of AI is unquestionable, however, as in the case of classical topology prediction, integrating different types of information may significantly raise the accuracy of such methods. Thus, traditional resources providing structural and experimental information at many different levels may serve as a valuable addition when developing novel ools.  

The UniTmp web resource provides an integrated platform for databases storing structural nformation at different evels: The Protein Data Bank of Transmembrane Proteins (PDBTM) (9 10  holding experimentally determined structures with the orientation of the lipid bilayer relative to the protein; the Topology Data Bank of Transmembrane Proteins (TOPDB) (11 12  containing all kinds of experimental topological data; TOPDOM (13 14  storing information about conserved protein domains and motifs located consistently on the same side of the membrane; The Human Transmembrane Proteome (HTP) 15  s an example of a significant step oward our complete understanding of TMP structures, achieved by storing all this information together. Depositing and connecting all these disparate pieces of information into a unified database helps researchers to find any kind of information at various structure levels of TMPs and paves the way for more reliable, AI-based structure predictions of them.  

# Materials and methods  

# Data resources  

Four sources of data were utilized during the development: InterPro (16  (release: 5.62–94.0), UniProt (17  (release 2023_2), PDB 18  until 25.08.2023) and Pubmed until 01.08.2023).  

# Data processing  

We used InterProScan (16  to search domains in CATH (19 , NCBIfam (20 , Panther (21 , Pfam (22 , Prints (23 , ProSite (24 , SMART (25  and SUPERFAMILY (26 . We used TMDET 27  o reconstruct he most ikely ocalization of he membrane bilayer using the original PDB structure. CCTOP (28  was used to predict signal peptides (notably we are using the latest SignalP6 (29  for this task), o discriminate TM and non-TM proteins and to predict TMP topology (Scampi-MSA (30  was replaced with Scampi2-MSA (31  for topology prediction and MemBrain (32  was removed). CCTOP automatically incorporates all experimental evidence when predicting topology or $\alpha$ -helical TMPs. n he case of $\upbeta$ -barrel TMPs, we predicted topology using HMMTOP (33 34  with a slightly modified architecture (similarly as in TOPDB 1.0 and 2.0), using experimental evidence as constraints. We used BLAST (35  (e-value $=10–5$ , $\mathrm{GOP}=11$ , ${\mathrm{GEP}}=1$ ) to search for homologous entries in the sequence pool. PDB (18  entries were assigned to UniProt (17  sequences using SIFTS (36  via PDBe updated mmCIF files. All temporary and final data are stored in a local MySQL database.  

# Results  

# Data collection and curation Data structure  

For each protein, we store amino acid sequences, UniProt Accession, UniProt ID, solved PDB structure and domain/motif information from InterPro. Using the sequence pool (TMP proteins from SwissProt, human reference proteome and individual proteins with experimental data) we created a network of homologous proteins using BLAST. Therefore, when searching for entries, homologous proteins are also automatically listed. Although experimental information is transferred between entries via CCTOP, this way the source of information is better accessible.  

# PDBTM data curation  

PDBTM has been updated weekly since its first release in 2004. During he weekly update, he TMDET algorithm s applied o each newly released PDB entry, and proteins dentified as transmembrane by the TMDET are investigated and manually curated f needed. For ntegrating PDBTM nto UniTmp, we scanned all PDB entries again by also applying homologous sequence information. We used SIFTS to assign the UniProt entry and the full protein sequence to PDB structures. We used TMDET on the PDB structures and CCTOP on he ull protein sequences to automatically select candidate $\alpha$ -helical and $\upbeta$ -barrel TMPs, which were then manually processed and corrected if needed. This way, several new PDB entries have been identified as transmembrane that were missed earlier, and several false positive hits were deleted from the database. In the current release, membrane-embedded structures of viral proteins are also included in the database that were formerly omitted, while PDB entries containing in silico predicted model structures have been removed. We remediate hundreds of entries that contain invalid region assignments, like re-entrant loops instead of transmembrane helices or invalid order of regions (e.g. the directly adjacent extra- and intracellular segments without an intervening transmembrane region, ransmembrane regions connecting segments from the same side etc). Altogether 459, 145 and 856 entries were added, deleted and remediated, respectively, those modifications yielded 406 newly annotated TMPs.  

# Gathering and curating TOPDB data  

Transmembrane protein structures in the PDBTM database provide only relative opological nformation, and t cannot be determined which one of the two non-membrane embedded parts of the protein (called side1 and side2) is situated inside and which is outside of the cell/organelle. Thus, we needed to add this information to all PDBTM structures by curation. Wherever possible, we manually assigned side definitions to PDB entries, using the original research article as the source for defining them. f a homologous entry has already been assigned, we transferred that annotation. Notably, we used a simplified partition that reflects the biochemical environment, and most cellular compartments are converted to a simplified binary definition: inside/outside. The only exception to this classification scheme was the bacterial and archaeal periplasmic space, which is located between the inner and outer membranes and cannot be easily classified using these terms. More information about side definitions has been made available at the TOPDB web resource, in the documents section. Notably, we added side definitions not only to the PDB entries containing transmembrane segments but also to entries that are soluble fragments of otherwise transmembrane proteins.  

Another major source of topological information comes from the literature, including experiments performed on individual proteins as well as high-throughput experiments. We scanned PubMed and Google Scholar for results indicating protein topology, prioritizing articles published after the last major update of TOPDB (in 2016). Despite the limited number of new low-throughput studies, several new experimental methods have been invented since our major database release, necessitating the update of the methods section as well. These methods nclude novel split-protein reporters 37 , new usion protein based assays 38 and electron microscopy based echniques (39 . Now we also regard experimentally validated eukaryotic linear motif based interactions with a known cytosolic, uminal, or extracellular partner as proof of topology. The latter information was inferred from the ELM database after manual curation of entries regarding transmembrane and topology status (40 . We also imported low-throughput posttranslational modification related data, whenever the partner and its location were identified (e.g. intracellularly localized or inward-facing enzyme dependent protein modification e.g. phosphorylation or ipidation, such as $N\mathrm{.}$ myristoylation 41 ).  

High-throughput mass spectrometry data regarding posttranslational modifications expanded substantially in the past years, including topologically relevant modifications, such as the novel bacterial N-glycosylation (42 . We also integrated an extensive amount of high-throughput eukaryotic N-glycosylation data from dedicated glycosylation databases, such as GlyGen (43  and GlyConnect (44  as well as further site annotations from UniProtKB based on experimental evidence. In all the cases before inclusion, it was also checked whether the sequence motifs around the collected sites met the criteria of the consensus sequence of N-type glycosylation (‘sequon’). Last but not east, we also ncluded results rom he numerous high-throughput surface labeling experiments carried out in our research group, yielding topologically reliable data (45–47 .  

# Defining domain localizations for the TOPDOM database  

We used CCTOP to predict the topology of $\alpha$ -helical TMPs in UniProtKB and subcellular localisations to extract the localization of non-TMPs, at first without ncorporating any experimental nformation. From CCTOP, only predictions above $85\%$ reliability were accepted. Domains from InterPro were assigned if they occurred at least 10 times, and in $99\%$ they appeared on the same side of the membrane (inside/outside). At the second iteration, CCTOP was used again, however experimental nformation and domain nformation rom he first iteration were also incorporated into the final prediction.  

# Combining all experimental and bioinformatic evidence for the HTP database  

We used the CCTOP algorithm’s TMP filtering ability on the human reference proteome o select $\alpha$ -helical TMPs. Using he network of homologous proteins, all experimental information from PDBTM, TOPDB and domain/motif information from TOPDOM is also incorporated.  

A schematic graph of data processing procedures is shown on Figure 1  

# Updating web backend and frontend Data processing, SQL and backend  

We used PHP 8.2 and Laravel 10.0 or reading and manipulating data and stored all data in a local MySQL server. BLAST searches and CCTOP predictions were made on our HPC.  

# Frontend development  

While we aimed to keep the original look and feel of each database so accustomed users could quickly find everything, the engine was completely overhauled on each side. The original home pages of the TOPDB and the TOPDOM databases had been written in PHP earlier, but without using any framework, while the HTP and PDBTM sites were written in $\mathrm{C}{+}{+}$ using the WT toolkit. Now all four home pages have been rewritten in $\mathrm{PHP~}8.2$ using Laravel 10.0 framework with integrated Eloquent SQL services and Blade template system. For visualizing 3D structures with the determined membrane orientation, we use a locally modified version of $\mathrm{Mol^{*}}$ (48 (the modified software is available on our git server, https: //git.enzim.ttk.hu/web/TmMolStar , while topology data are shown by using an in-house developed React based software, called JsvLib. Public API endpoints are also provided for all the our databases, or details see he Document and/or Usage menu item in the selected database.  

# Future plans  

# Data update schedules  

We aim to update all four databases regularly. PDBTM has been updated every week after the PDB update, and we will keep on updating it as before. Adding side definitions to PDBTM entries, as well as updating alignments and the network of protein relatives is planned after the release of the new UniProt version (i.e. quarterly). Thus, TOPDB is going to be updated four times a year. TOPDOM and HTP updates will follow the TOPDB update.  

# Improving source resources  

Our next goal is to update the TMDET algorithm to make it more robust, i.e. to be able to identify incorrect structures, non-biological oligomer forms and new features such as embedding proteins in curved membranes or bacterial protein complexes in double (inner and outer) membranes. We also plan to change the input processing so that not only ‘ent’ formatted files but CIF format will be also handled. We also plan to improve the CCTOP algorithm to be more accurate in discriminating between ransmembrane and non-transmembrane proteins and o ncorporate newly developed topology prediction methods such as TMBED (49  or DeepTMHMM (50 .  

# Integrating other resources  

We also plan to integrate more databases and resources into the common UniTmp platform, such as the TmAlphaFold database (8  and MemDis (51  prediction algorithm.  

# The new UniTmp Database statistics  

The complete UniTmp database holds 774 508 unique amino acid sequences from which 92 337 belong to transmembrane proteins. Regarding TMP sequences, experimental information is available for 9898 and 11 159 TMP sequences from UniProtKB and PDB, respectively. The number of TMPs in the PDBTM database has grown from 1700 to 9235 structures $8608~\alpha$ -helical and $627\ \upbeta$ -barrel proteins) since its last published release (10 . The TOPDB database now contains 9088 entries, including $8783\ \alpha$ -helical and $305\mathrm{~\AA~}$ -barrel proteins) and 536035 topology data regions that more than doubles the number of entries and contains six times the topology data points since ts ast release. The number of conservatively localized domains also increased in the TOPDOM database from 5236 to 8692 domains (from 3699 to 7065 for inside localization and from 1537 to 1627 for outside localization). The HTP database now contains 5466 proteins, which covers $26.8\%$ of the human proteome. By counting all experimental and bioinformatics evidence in HTP this means 704576 constraints helping the prediction derived from 3190 experimental and 558 domain-based sources. For 2906 $(53.2\%)$ proteins, there is at least one structural, other experimental, or domain-based evidence available.

# Discussion  

UniTmp is a novel resource that merges various databases developed for transmembrane proteins. UniTmp includes PDBTM, TOPDB, TOPDOM and the HTP databases and provides nteroperability between hem. These databases have existed for over 10 years and they provide structural information at different levels. They were used for a diverse range of research tasks. Manual annotation of experimental data is a unique and valuable addition, and our resources supplied training and testing benchmark data for state-of-the-art deep learning prediction algorithms, such as the SignalP series (29 52  or contact predictions (53 . In contrast to most topology prediction algorithms, CCTOP incorporates experimental and domain information from homologous proteins, enabling these resources to serve as a solid base to perform surveys to analyze the impact of mutations and diseases (54– 56 . nformation about he ocalization of domains and motifs can be utilized to construct filters when developing pipelines for Short Linear Motif analysis (57 . Topology information can be also extremely useful to design wet-lab (58  or computational (59  experiments, to develop novel therapeutics acting on membrane proteins, or to rigorously benchmark highthroughput experiment design (45 .  

The continuous update and the reliable data in these databases allow he ntegration of heir content nto he argest resources of this field. Membrane proteins from the PDBTM database are shown on RCSB web pages since 2021 (60  as well as data are available on the PDBe-KB public FTP area in JSON ormat https:// tp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/pdbe-kb/ annotations/PDBTM/  and they are also integrated into the PDBe graph database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdbe-kb/ graph .  

Comparing the contents of the PDBTM and the OPM (61 database, he other main source in the field of transmembrane PDB structure annotation, we found that among the bi- and polytopic membrane proteins that have defined TM regions and are at least 20 residues long there are 8687 common proteins, while PDBTM contains 796 TMPs that we could not find in OPM and 499 TMPs in OPM that are not in PDBTM. Note that OPM is for all proteins that interact with the membrane in some way, whereas PDBTM is for transmembrane proteins only. Therefore most of he proteins n he atter cluster are , ncorrectly annotated monotopic membrane proteins; ii, short peptides in the micelle that are intentionally omitted from PDBTM because they aren’t TMPs; iii, flagellar or pilus proteins hat are also omitted rom PDBTM because he membrane definitions of each chain in the homooligomeric structures are different; iv, proteins without an .ent file in the PDB database.  

The most important feature of the UniTmp database is to collect and unify information from different sources to help better understand the structure and topology of proteins. For example, AT8A1_HUMAN is an ATPase mediating the translocation of phospholipids, playing an essential role in membrane trafficking and signaling pathways (62 . Cryoelectron microscopy revealed he structure of six different ype IV P-type adenosine triphosphatases (62 , which are stored in the PDBTM database (Figure 2A). There are other experiments performed on this protein, that indirectly help to define the topology: for example, using fluorescent confocal microscopy and mutation analysis it was shown that the protein has an adaptin binding, dileucine-type endocytosis and sorting signal at position from 1105 to 1110 (63 . Adaptinbinding dileucine motifs occur exclusively on he cytosolic side of membrane proteins, near to N- or C-termini of the protein (40 . This information is stored in the TOPDB database, in addition to topology information derived from the paper descript the cryo-electron microscopy structure determination (Figure 2B). Furthermore, according to the CATH database (19  P-type ATPases possess a conserved domain, P-type ATPase cytoplasmic domain N (in this case from 479 to 655 residues), which we also store in the TOPDOM database as a domain always conservatively located on the same, cytoplasmic side of the membrane (Figure 2C). Transferring all this information helps to predict the most accurate topology for this protein, which is in turn stored in the HTP database (Figure 2D).

# ABSTRACT  

Histones are abundant nuclear proteins that are essential for the packaging of eukaryotic DNA into chromosomes. Different histone variants, in combination with their modification ‘code’, control regulation of gene expression in diverse cellular processes. Several enzymes that catalyze the addition and removal of multiple histone modifications have been discovered in the past decade, enabling investigations of their role(s) in normal cellular processes and diverse pathological conditions. This sudden influx of data, however, has resulted in need of an updated knowledgebase that compiles, organizes and presents curated scientific information to the user in an easily accessible format. Here, we present HIstome, a browsable, manually curated, relational database that provides information about human histone proteins, their sites of modifications, variants and modifying enzymes. HIstome is a knowledgebase of 55 human histone proteins, 106 distinct sites of their post-translational modifications (PTMs) and 152 histone-modifying enzymes. Entries have been grouped into 5 types of histones, 8 types of post-translational modifications and 14 types of enzymes that catalyze addition and removal of these modifications. The resource will be useful for epigeneticists, pharmacologists and clinicians. HIstome: The Histone Infobase is available online at http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/ coee/histome/ and http://www.actrec.gov.in/ histome/.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Histones are small, highly basic nuclear proteins that associate with DNA in a specific stoichiometry to form the nucleosome, which further contributes to the formation of the chromatin fiber to package the complete genome within the nucleus. The human genome codes for more than 50 different types of histones that are expressed in a cell cycle-dependent or -independent manner. Mammalian histones have been categorized into five types; core histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 and a linker histone H1. Each histone category comprises of a defined repertoire of ‘variants’ that seem to have homo- or heteromorphous sequence variation and are expressed depending upon the cellular context. Linker histone H1 is also expressed in forms of different variants that exhibit tissue-specific expression and provide varying degree of compaction to the genome. Histones are subject to large number of reversible, enzymatic post-translational modifications (PTMs). Histones and their variants, in combination with their PTM ‘code’, are involved in major cellular processes like DNA damage response, X chromosome inactivation, transcriptional regulation as well as formation of an epigenetic memory (1–8). Dysregulation of such functions leads to the development of a number of diseases and syndromes (9). Hence, the information related to histone proteins that directly/indirectly affect these processes is extremely valuable for biologists.  

Currently, a part of this vast information is represented by the Human Histone Modification Database (HHMD) (10), Histone (Sequence) Database (11,12), Histone Systematic Mutation Database (HistoneHits) (13) and ChromatinDB (14). The HHMD focuses on the storage and integration of histone modification information from experimental data (10). The database provides cytogenetic position-based and tissue-based information about histone modifications. However, since the database is primarily based on data extracted from chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, the numbers of histone modifications covered by HHMD are limited by availability of modification specific antibodies. As a result, HHMD covers less than half of the total number of known human histone modifications with no information about modifications of linker histone H1. A large number of histone modifications show variant-specific enrichment; as a result, function of a particular type of histone modification becomes more relevant in the light of which histone variant it is expressed. Partly due to unavailability of antibodies, HHMD does not cover variant-specific information in detail. Another recent addition is the histone sequence database (11,12), which is a collection of all histones and histone-fold containing proteins from a large number of organisms including humans. The database also provides information about three-dimensional structures of histones and human histone gene complement. The database, however, does not provide detailed information about post-translational modifications of histones. HistoneHits (13) and ChromatinDB (14) provide histone-centred information in yeast. While HistoneHits database deals with the mutation analysis of histone proteins, ChromatinDB provides genome-wide ChIP data for different histones and modifications. Although being a good model system to study epigenetic regulation by histone modification, yeast lacks the complexity shown by histone variants and their coding genes in humans.  

Other than the histone-related databases, SysPTM database (15) also provides information about histone PTMs. The database covers PTM maps of histones and their variants in a number of species including humans. This database, however, provides PTM maps of only a fraction of the total human histones. This database also does not provide functional information regarding histone modifications. Multiple enzymes often modify histones in a context-dependent manner. One common disadvantage of the above mentioned databases is that they lack in information about the histone modifying enzymes. Therefore, despite the availability of these existing databases concerning histones, there remains a need for a comprehensive database that can provide a compilation of gene and protein centric functional information about histone variants, their PTMs and the modifying enzyme(s). Most importantly, interrelationship between all the above components is critical to ascertain biological relevance of the histone modifications.  

Over the past decade, tremendous efforts have been directed toward understanding the epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation. This has resulted in plethora of articles on the various molecules that are known to contribute to the epigenetic machinery (1–8). Most of these are enzymes that catalyze the addition or removal of PTMs on histones, which further dramatically affect gene regulation. On similar lines, variant-specific modifications have also become an indispensable piece of information. The amount of experimental data that exists on histones and their PTMs is ever increasing and it is now essential to draw conclusive information from all of this data.  

This information can also provide important insights into the study of complex diseases such as cancer.  

To this end, we present Histome: The Histone Infobase, a unique relational knowledgebase encompassing detailed information about 55 histone proteins, 106 types of their distinct PTMs and 152 types of histone modifying enzymes along with their biological significance. Such comprehensive compilation of information related to histones and the epigenetic modifications is not available in any other databases available until this date.  

# Construction and contents  

Data sources. The HIstome data and related infor mation are gathered from PubMed listed literature and publicly available UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot database (16). UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot database was selected, as it is the most comprehensive protein database with marked sites for protein modifications. Histones and modifying enzymes were searched in ‘reviewed’ entries of UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot using keyword ‘histone’ in ‘human’ species. The above results were manually curated to remove non-specific entries and add missing entries using literature. Gene related information such as symbol, name, location and GeneID was acquired from HGNC database (17). Other details were acquired from Entrez databases such as UniGene (18), OMIM (19) and RefSeq (20). Sites of histone PTMs and general information about histones and modifying enzymes was acquired through PubMed listed literature. After an exhaustive literature search we identified 55 histone variants, 106 distinct sites of their modifications and 152 modifying enzymes. Pubmed has been used to obtain information on every single protein entry (histone/enzyme) and post-translational modifications. The search was majorly carried out using specific names as well as alternative names of the proteins and coding genes. For PTMs, references were searched by using both full names and short codes. To gather information about the disease perspective for a given protein/gene/PTM, a general search was carried out in Pubmed. The resulting numbers of hits were then filtered out manually by going through relevant hits. More than 700 unique references have been listed out of which ${\sim}200$ unique references are in the disease section and ${>}500$ unique references are in the database notes.  

Data integration and links to external databases. Programs used to parse UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot XML files and output resulting data into MySQL tables were written in Python. Disease tables were generated manually by curating information obtained from literature. All data and information were stored in a MySQL relational database on a Linux server. Figure 1 shows a schematic layout of the database illustrating the links between different tables. Queries to the database were implemented in PHP scripts running in an Apache/PHP environment. The PHP scripting language enabled us to embed server-side code in XHTML documents. To annotate the functions of histone variants and their modifying enzymes, hyperlinks were created to UniprotKB/Swiss-Prot, HGNC, OMIM,

Figure 1. Organization of the histone infobase and relationships between tables. The Intro table stores information about types of histones, enzymes and PTMs. Since histone proteins are often coded by multiple non-allelic genes, and because many genes produce multiple mRNA species through alternative splicing; protein, gene and mRNA specific information has been stored in three different tables (viz. main, gene and transcript). PTM related information has been stored in a separate PTM table. Disease related information about histones, enzymes and PTMs has been stored. Tables are interlinked to other tables.  

UniGene, RefSeq and other public databases. Internal hyperlinks were also created within the database pages wherever appropriate. These links greatly expand the annotation of HIstome providing related knowledge from diverse sources.  

Database and website implementation. HIstome is available online and user friendly access is provided via a web interface. A detailed section has been added through side-menu on the contents of the database and how this resource can be used. A general introduction to chromatin and a detailed introduction to histones, their PTMs and modifying enzymes is available under respective menu elements. Information about different types of histones, their PTMs, various enzymes and likewise any specific entry can be retrieved in the database. The content of the database can be searched directly using any keyword(s) across the database using either a Google powered search or HIstome advanced search.  

# Utility and discussion  

Interface and visualization. The infobase is presented using XHTML and Javascript dynamically generated using PHP with a MySQL backend. A drop-down menu bar has been provided for easy navigation of the database contents. The front page provides statistics about the total number of entries of histone proteins, their distinct PTMs and modifying enzymes in humans. A general tutorial has also been provided to explain the resource structure and it can be used in ‘How to use HIstome’ section. A general introduction to histone biology is provided in the ‘Lead-in’ section of the database. Individual records of histones, their sites of modifications and modifying enzymes can be browsed through dynamically generated menus, sub-menus and tables or via the advanced search options.  

Entry information. Information about histones, PTMs and enzymes (‘writers’ and ‘erasers’) can be obtained by clicking on respective elements in the menu bar. Each of these menu elements expands into submenus, which display subcategories. Histones have been categorized into five types viz. H1, H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. Each histone page provides general information along with a table of its variants. Each variant in the table has been hyperlinked to individual variant page that provides further information (Figure 2). The variant page has also been provided with a visualization that graphically represents sites of PTMs on the histone peptide. The visualization is dynamically created with the Raphae¨ l Javascript library. The PTMs are hyperlinked to the individual PTM pages, which can also be accessed through the menu.  

Histone PTMs have been categorized into eight types depending on the type of modification and the modified amino acid, e.g. lysine acetylation, arginine methylation, serine/threonine/tyrosine phosphorylation and others. General information about each type of PTM such as

Figure 2. Screenshot depicting the information retrieved from a search for Histone H3.2. A visualization of all post-translational modification on histone variant 3.2 appears at the top. The table below provides links to more information from HIstome as well as other public databases.  

the donor of the functional group, molecular weight of the functional group and a list of site-specific modifications in that category can be accessed through sub-menu elements. Histone modifying enzymes are broadly categorized into ‘writers’ and ‘erasers’, those that catalyze the addition or removal of PTMs, respectively (21). Specific PTM page that provides information about particular PTM can be accessed by clicking on the PTM code. Individual writer and eraser pages can be accessed by clicking on their names or by browsing the respective menu elements as described below.  

The writer enzymes have been categorized into eight types, e.g. arginine deiminases, lysine ubiquitinases, etc., depending on their catalytic activity. General information of each category of enzymes such as type of catalysis, cofactors used, etc. can be accessed by clicking on respective submenu elements that displays specific enzyme page. The enzyme page also lists various enzymes in the category and site/s of histone modification catalyzed by them. The enzymes have been hyperlinked to individual specific-enzyme pages that display manually curated information.  

Description of each entry has been extracted from relevant PubMed listed literature that has been duly cited using their unique PubMed IDs (PMID). Individual histone and enzyme records also contain dynamically generated tables that provide accessions to gene, transcript and protein entries from other databases such as UniProt/Swiss-Prot, HGNC and Entrez. One Kb upstream ( $-700$ transcription start site $+300)$ ) DNA sequence has been extracted for each gene entry from UCSC genome browser and is easily accessible from the table. The PTM pages have been used to link the variant and enzyme-specific pages that assist in faster retrieval of information.  

All tables that appear on the site can be downloaded in MS Excel format. The format includes the external links that appear on the page thus enabling easier downstream search. Contents of the database can be searched using a Google powered search or HIstome advanced search. The advanced search enables a targeted search for keywords in a particular table. Specifically, a user can search for a term (with wildcards) on histones, PTMs and enzymes and also filter disease associations. The results from the search lead the user directly to related detailed pages.  

Over the past few years, epigenetics has emerged as one of the fastest growing areas of biomedical research. Hence, understanding various epigenetic modifications and their relationships with biological processes is of great importance. The information available on this database can be used by biology researchers to understand roles of histone modifications/variants in DNA-mediated processes such as DNA damage, transcription, cellular transformation and differentiation. Additionally, the database can also be used to understand the roles of histone modifications and the chromatin-modifying machinery toward gene activity and the maintenance and inheritance of active and inactive chromatin states. Given the significant role of the histone-modifying proteins in human disease, efforts to discover highly specific small-molecule inhibitors of these enzymes are quickly gaining momentum. Accumulating evidence suggests that histone modifications and/or components of their modification machinery are associated with the development of various human diseases including cancer, inflammation, cardiovascular and psychiatric disorders (21). Information pertaining to association of specific histone variants or histone modifications with human diseases would be also of considerable interest to researchers studying disease biology. The advanced search option available in the database can be used for mining specific information. For example query with search terms ‘diseases’ and ‘melanoma’ yields two results, one for the histone variant macro H2A.2 and another for the histone modification H3K9me3. Clicking on H3K9me3 then further provides a detailed infosheet on the enzymes and disease associations along with their Pubmed IDs.  

# Future development  

The database content is carefully maintained separately from its presentation. This enables us to easily update the database content to reflect new information, which in turn is presented to the user. Literature searches have been planned to allow for identification and integration of new entries into the database on quarterly basis. The next major addition planned to the database is the incorporation of ‘Readers’. ‘Readers’, generally characterized by presence of certain domains that enable their binding to various PTMs, are involved in an array of cellular processes that provide meaning to the language of histone modifications (22). ‘Readers’ will also be browsable from menu as well as from entry pages of PTMs that they recognize. A module on association of histones, their PTMs and modifying enzymes with pathological conditions has been planned during expansion phase. We also plan to include entries from other species, especially model organisms, to broaden the scope of the database to a larger audience.  

# CONCLUSION  

# HIstome  

The Histone Infobase is a web-based resource that provides comprehensive information about human histone proteins and their variants. It also lists and describes histone post-translational modifications and enzymes responsible for addition and removal of these PTMs from histone peptides. Each enzyme and histone entry has been provided with external links to other public databases. The database entries are cross-referenced with each other and can be browsed through menu as well as through individual entries, thus providing multiple ways to access the same information. This database will be a valuable resource for researchers as well as students working in the rapidly growing field of histone biology and epigenetic regulation.  

# Availability and requirement  

HIstome is freely available at http://www.iiserpune.ac.in/ coee/histome/index.php and at http://www.actrec.gov .in/histome/index.php. The database is fully functional with all standards compliant web browsers.

# ABSTRACT  

R-loops play versatile roles in many physiological and pathological processes, and are of great interest to scientists in multiple fields. However, controversy about their genomic localization and incomplete understanding of their regulatory network raise great challenges for R-loop research. Here, we present R-loopBase (https://rloopbase.nju.edu. cn) to tackle these pressing issues by systematic integration of genomics and literature data. First, based on 107 high-quality genome-wide R-loop mapping datasets generated by 11 different technologies, we present a reference set of human R-loop zones for high-confidence R-loop localization, and spot conservative genomic features associated with R-loop formation. Second, through literature mining and multi-omics analyses, we curate the most comprehensive list of R-loop regulatory proteins and their targeted R-loops in multiple species to date. These efforts help reveal a global regulatory network of Rloop dynamics and its potential links to the development of cancers and neurological diseases. Finally, we integrate billions of functional genomic annotations, and develop interactive interfaces to search, visualize, download and analyze R-loops and R-loop regulators in a well-annotated genomic context. RloopBase allows all users, including those with little bioinformatics background to utilize these data for their own research. We anticipate R-loopBase will become a one-stop resource for the R-loop community.  

# INTRODUCTION  

R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures composed of an RNA:DNA hybrid and a displaced singlestranded DNA (1). Initially considered as rare by-products of transcription, R-loops are now found widely distributed across genomes in species from bacteria to human (2). Excessive R-loops are critical sources of genome instability (3,4), and underlie many human diseases (5), such as cancers (6,7), neurodegenerative disorders (8) and autoimmune diseases (9). Intriguingly, R-loops have been increasingly appreciated as key cellular regulators in many physiological processes (1,4), including DNA replication (10), homologous recombination (11), DNA damage repair (12) and transcription (13). Collectively, the functional studies of Rloops have greatly advanced both basic and translational research.  

Over the past decade, the recognition of the functional importance of R-loops has accelerated the development of more than ten different genome-wide R-loop detection technologies that are based on either the anti-RNA:DNA hybrid monoclonal antibody S9.6 (14–21) or (the hybrid binding domain of) catalytically-deficient RNase H1 (21– 25). Although all these technologies are able to create a genome-wide R-loop map, they are not always consistent with each other regarding R-loop sizes and locations, and other associated genomic features (1,26–28). While an early electron microscopy study suggested that individual R-loop structures are of ${\sim}200$ nt in length (29), sizes of mapped R-loops are within a much broader range from a few hundred bases to several kilobases. Promoter regions are generally considered as R-loop hotspots (21), a large fraction of R-loops mapped by some technologies are however within gene bodies (18), in the vicinity of transcription termination sites (18), or even in intergenic regions (15,19).  

Furthermore, many mapped R-loop regions do not seem to comply with the GC skew sequence property, the G4 formation propensity, and the topological requirement, all of which have been found tightly associated with R-loop formation (13,21,29,30). While limitations of different technologies that could largely explain these discrepancies have been extensively discussed (1,26–28), what is missing is a systematic effort to compare different technologies side by side in a well-annotated genomic context, and to integrate all available R-loop mapping data to generate a reference set of R-loops for future functional R-loop studies.  

An increasing number of proteins are now thought to regulate R-loop dynamics. Certain RNA processing proteins and DNA damage-related factors may counteract R-loop formation, and some nucleases and helicases may resolve existing R-loops. However, the molecular mechanism and the global regulatory network involved are only partially understood. For example, considering their pervasive association with chromatin (31), RNA processing proteins may regulate R-loops in an RNA-independent way rather than through RNA binding activity as proposed before (4). Although helicases are in general considered to limit R-loops by resolving RNA:DNA hybrids, they may instead promote R-loop formation by resolving structured RNA to facilitate its invasion into DNA (32). R-loop regulatory proteins, named as R-loop regulators, have been systematically profiled by either S9.6 antibody or hybrid probe enrichment coupled with mass spectrometry analysis (33,34). However, due to the affinity of S9.6 to dsRNA (35), it remains unclear whether the identified proteins are truly involved in Rloop regulation. Furthermore, validated R-loop regulators are scattered in the literature and how they are functionally connected is unclear.  

Here, we establish R-loopBase to tackle the above challenges. The massive amount of human genomics data enables us to perform integrative analysis. We thus generate human R-loop zones of different confidence levels and R-loop regulome with comprehensive functional annotations. We also curate and annotate R-loop regulators in mouse, yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and Escherichia coli to support R-loop research in these model organisms. User-friendly interfaces are developed to allow users, even those with little bioinformatics background, to leverage these data for their own R-loop research. We will continuously update R-loopBase in the future to better serve the R-loop community.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Collection and analyses of genome-wide R-loop mapping data in human  

We collected meta information of genome-wide R-loop mapping data from all PubMed literature with the keyword “R-loop” OR “R-loops” OR “RNA DNA hybrid” OR “RNA DNA hybrids” OR “DNA RNA hybrid” OR “DNA RNA hybrids” as query. In current release of RloopBase, datasets generated from human cells under basal conditions published on and before March 31st 2021 were downloaded (Supplementary Table S1). In total, 118 datasets generated by 11 different technologies were collected (9,13,14,16,18,19,21,23–25,28,34,36–55) (Table 1 and  

Supplementary Figure S1), and subjected to a standardized data analysis pipeline (Supplementary Figure S2). Briefly, technical replicates if existed were merged first, and raw sequencing data were then mapped to the human genome (hg38) using Bowtie2 local alignment mode (56). Uniquelymapped non-redundant reads were kept as useful reads and samples with $\mathrm{{}>}7\mathrm{{M}}$ useful reads were considered as with sufficient read counts. To maximally leverage the sequencing data, biological replicates with $\mathrm{<}7\mathrm{M}$ useful reads were merged to meet with the minimal reads count cutoff as long as they were highly correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient $>0.5$ ). Finally, peak calling was done with MACS2 (57) for all useful reads (DRIP-seq, DRIVE-seq, MapR and R-loop CUT&Tag) or useful reads from Watson or Crick strand separately (DRIPc-seq, RDIP-seq, ssDRIPseq, qDRIP-seq, R-ChIP and RR-ChIP), using $q$ -value cutoff 0.01 for narrow peak (R-ChIP and R-loop CUT&Tag) and 0.05 for broad peak (DRIP-seq, DRIPc-seq, RDIPseq, ssDRIP-seq, qDRIP-seq, DRIVE-seq, MapR and RRChIP). If multiple biological replicates existed, peaks with $\geq50$ bp overlap among $\geq2$ replicates were merged and taken as reproducible peaks. Only peaks with strong signal enrichment (fold change $\geq2$ ) and outside of ChIPseq blacklisted regions were used for downstream analysis. Samples with ${<}100$ peaks called were discarded. Following ENCODE guidelines for ChIP-seq data analyses (58), we further calculated signal portion of tags (SPOT) and reads in blacklisted regions (RiBL) as part of quality control matrix for users’ reference (Supplementary Table S2). When processing bisDRIP-seq data, rather than peak calling, we uploaded the processed bisDRIP-seq data onto the R-loopBase genome browser for visualization and comparison with other data.  

# Generation of human R-loop zones of different confidence levels  

Considering that R-loop peaks co-detected independently by multiple technologies are more likely conservative bona fide R-loops, we performed integrative analysis of all mapped R-loop peaks in human cells identified by all technologies. First, stranded R-loop peaks were merged as R-loop zones on Watson or Crick strand separately. Non-stranded R-loops, if overlapped with stranded R-loop peaks, were also assigned to Watson or Crick R-loop zones accordingly. The remaining non-stranded R-loop peaks were merged as non-stranded R-loop zones. Second, the resulting R-loop zones were further partitioned into subregions of $n$ different confidence levels, where $n$ is the minimal number of technologies by which individual subregions were detected by. For example, R-loop zones of level 3 were those co-detected by $\geq3$ technologies. Small R-loop zones ( $_{<50}$ bp) were not included.  

# Collection of known R-loop regulators  

To collect known proteins involved in R-loop regulation from scattered literature, we downloaded all PubMed publications using keyword “R-loop” OR “R-loops” OR “RNA DNA hybrid” OR “RNA DNA hybrids” OR “DNA RNA hybrid” OR “DNA RNA hybrids” as query for manual curation of R-loop regulators. A protein is considered as an Rloop regulator if it binds to, stabilizes, resolves or degrades RNA:DNA hybrids, or levels of R-loops or RNA:DNA hybrids are changed upon chemical or genetic manipulation of the protein. Validated R-loop regulators in human, mouse, yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and $E.$ . coli were collected and annotated (Supplementary Table S3), and putative R-loop regulators identified in high throughput screening studies (33,34) were also included.

# Protein–protein Interaction (PPI) network and gene list enrichment analysis of R-loop regulators  

GO (gene ontology) (59) and DO (disease ontology) (60) enrichment analysis of validated or putative R-loop regulators were done by clusterProfiler (61), and only top ranked GO or DO terms were shown. For validated R-loop regulators, high-confidence physical interactions (minimal required interaction $\mathrm{score}=0.700)$ with experimental evidences and integrated information from databases were retrieved from the STRING database (62) and visualized by Cytoscape software (63). Proteins were organized into different clusters using the AutoAnnotate plug-in (64). GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were then performed for clusters consisted of at least three genes.  

# Identification of R-loops targeted by R-loop regulators  

R-loops have been mapped with replicates before and after gene knockdown for ten R-loop regulators (Supplementary Table S1), allowing us to identify their targeted R-loops. To do so, broad peaks were first called by referring to the references where these data were originally reported. Differential binding analyses were then done with default settings of DiffBind package (65) except for summits $=F A L S E$ and bUseSummarizeOverla $y s=T R U E$ DEseq2 (66) was called by DiffBind for differential analyses. Thirty-three validated human regulators have ChIP-seq data available, and 21 with CLIP-seq available. We downloaded peak files of these data from ENCODE project (67). R-loops intersected with ChIP-seq or CLIP-seq peaks as determined by BEDTools (68) were taken as potential targets of the corresponding regulator. For the above human R-loop regulators, we turned to published literature to summarize a list of their targeted R-loops validated by DNA:RNA hybrid immunoprecipitation qPCR (Supplementary Table S4). Primer-blast was used to locate the targeted R-loop region, which would be kept only when there was only one perfectly-matched locus, and the locus was consistent with what was reported in the corresponding literature.  

# Integration of functional genomics data  

For cell types with R-loop mapping data available, we integrated and analyzed other genomics data that might help to distinguish bona fide R-loops from false positives, or interpret the molecular function of R-loops and R-loop regulators (Supplementary Table S5). G4 ChIP-seq (69–71), RPA ChIP-seq (43,72), GRO-seq (13,73–76) and PRO-seq (24,77) data were searched and downloaded from GEO (78). All datasets were processed by following the original publications. ChIP-seq data for 29 different histone modifications, CLIP-seq and ChIP-seq data for validated R-loop regulators, ATAC-seq, WGBS and Repli-seq data were downloaded from ENCODE (67). R-loop-related sequence features were prepared as below. Putative G4 motifs were identified on a genome-wide scale as described previously (79). GC percent was directly downloaded from UCSC genome browser (80). AT or GC skew values were computed for every 110 nt window with the step size of 10 nt. Predicted R-loop forming sequences were downloaded from R-loopDB (81). CrossMap was used for conversion between different genome builds whenever needed (82). Expression profiles of R-loop regulators were based on GTEx (83), TCGA (84) and CCLE (85) data.  

# Development of R-loopBase management system and interactive user interfaces  

R-loopBase was developed using several web development technologies. Data were largely managed with MySQL. Web pages were built by HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX, JSP, Java and Tomcat. The page contents were delivered by Apache. A local R-loopBase genome browser was developed on the basis of UCSC genome browser (80,86). R-loopBase is freely accessible using the URL https:// rloopbase.nju.edu.cn.  

# RESULTS  

# Identification and characterization of a reference set of human R-loop zones  

A major challenge in R-loop field is to precisely locate Rloops across the genome (1). Different technologies usually give rise to distinct genome-wide R-loop maps in the same cells (13,14,23–25,41,43,52,53) (Figures 1A–C). Even applying the same technology in the same cell line, different labs (42,46,51) (Figures 1A and D) or the same lab (18,21,36) (Figures 1A and E) sometimes generate R-loop maps with large differences. These broad discrepancies are largely rooted in different protocols of DNA fragmentation, R-loop enrichment and sequencing library preparation adopted by different (and even the same) technologies (Supplementary Figure S1). It is currently premature to conclude which technology or protocol is better than the others. Nevertheless, the high reproducibility between biological replicates generated in the same study indicates that each technology itself is robust if all experimental conditions are well controlled (54) (Figure 1F). With inspection, we noted that positive R-loop loci verified previously are usually well-supported by multiple independent technologies, such as, the R-loop forming region at ATRAID promoter (13) (Figure 2A). In contrast, as exemplified by SNRPN locus (87) (Figure 2A), most negative R-loop loci are not detectable or detected only by a limited number of technologies. We therefore postulate that integrative analysis of all R-loop mapping data holds the promise of distinguishing those conservative R-loop zones from technologyspecific false positives or experimental variations.  

As R-loop mapping technologies have been extensively applied to human cells in comparison with other species, we were therefore motivated to generate a reference set of human R-loop zones by integrative analysis. A total of 118 datasets generated in 28 human cell types under basal conditions by 11 different R-loop mapping technologies (Supplementary Figure S1) were collected and processed (Materials and Methods, Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). Of them, 107 datasets from 26 cell types survived quality control, which took into consideration of usable reads count, reproducibility, signal enrichment and specificity and so on (Materials and Methods, Figure 2B and Supplementary Table S2). We combined all mapping data of different cell origins, aiming to characterize all possible R-loop forming regions in any human cell type. We assumed that regions detected with multiple independent technologies are more likely R-loop forming regions of high confidence by mitigating intrinsic limitations of individual technologies. Following this principle, we partitioned the Rloop regions mapped by different technologies into different confidence levels, which correspond to the minimal number of technologies they were detected by (Materials and Methods and Figure 2B). For example, the resulting R-loop zones of level 1 are those detected by $\geq1$ technology, those co-detected by $\geq2$ different technologies are classified as level $2{\tt R}$ -loop zones, and so on and so forth. Along with the increase of confidence levels, the number and median length of R-loop zones decreased from ${\sim}8000000$ to ${\sim}200$ (Figure 2C), and from ${\sim}800$ nt to ${\sim}200$ nt (Figure 2D), respectively. As predicted, R-loop zones of higher confidence levels were more often distributed at promoter regions (Figure 2E), and more likely associated with well-known R-loop-associated features, such as GC skew (Figure 2F), and G4 formation as determined by G4 ChIP-seq (Figure 2G), confirming that bona fide R-loops were increasingly enriched in R-loop zones of higher confidence levels. In support of the role of R-loops in regulating transcription termination (88), percentages of R-loops at TTS regions also gradually increased except for level 9. When compared with predicted R-loops solely based on sequence features by R-loopDB (81), a similar trend was observed (Figure 2H). Notably, a considerable fraction of high-confidence R-loops were not detected by R-loopDB (Figure 2H), suggesting that sequence feature is not the only molecular determinant for R-loop formation. In sum, we characterized a reference set of human R-loops of different confidence levels, allowing customized analysis by researchers who are interested in R-loop biology.

The regulatory mechanisms of R-loop dynamics have been studied and documented in scattered literature, and we were thus prompted to understand the global regulatory network by manually curating and systematically characterizing the most comprehensive list of R-loop regulatory proteins (Materials and Methods). A total of 1185 proteins in human, 24 in mouse, 63 in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and 21 in $E.$ . coli were collected as R-loop regulators (Supplementary Table S3 and Figure 3A). We next focused on human R-loop regulators given the greater breadth of data available in human. Of 1185 human proteins, 186 $(15.69\%)$ were validated in multiple independent studies (53, $4.47\%$ , or by multiple assays (64, $5.40\%$ ) or one assay (69, $5.82\%$ ) in only one study (Figure 3A). Among a variety of assays (Supplementary Table S3), the S9.6 antibody was most widely used (Figure 3B). However, given the specificity issue of S9.6 antibody, the sensitivity to RNase $\mathrm{H}$ treatment was often introduced as the gold standard (Figure 3B). It was also an important alternative to directly examine the binding, helicase or nuclease activity of a protein towards synthetic

RNA:DNA hybrids in vitro (Figure 3B). Although not validated yet, the remaining 999 human proteins are potentially implicated in R-loop regulation as well. They were significant hits in one or two proteomics profiling studies for identification of RNA:DNA hybrid binding proteins (Figure 3A) (33,34). Similar to validated R-loop regulators, they were also enriched to be DNA, RNA or chromatin binding proteins (Supplementary Figure S3), suggesting that a considerable fraction of them may be authentic R-loop regulators. Collectively, we cataloged a comprehensive list of proteins regulating R-loops to date.  

To gain an insight into how R-loop regulators are functionally related to each other, we performed PPI network analysis focusing on validated human R-loop regulators (Materials and Methods). Seven distinct clusters were readily identified, and GO enrichment analysis revealed clusterspecific enrichment of biological processes (Materials and Methods and Figure 3C). Clusters 1, 5 and 6 mainly consisted of proteins involved in DNA replication or damage response processes, consistent with the deleterious role of R-loops to induce replication stress and even DNA damages as well as the regulatory role of R-loops to facilitate efficient DNA damage repair (12). Proteins in RNA metabolic processes, including RNA splicing and export factors (cluster 2) and RNA exosome complex (cluster 7), constituted the second largest group of R-loop regulators, supporting the proposed function of RNA binding proteins in counteracting R-loop formation (4). Interestingly, many RNA binding proteins (cluster 4), especially those involved in small RNA processing, are functionally connected with DNA damage repair factors, in favor of the notion that RBP re-localization upon DNA damage may coordinately regulate RNA and DNA metabolism (89). As R-loops are dynamically coupled with transcription (13), the other group of R-loop modulators mainly included transcription elongation factors (cluster 3).

(G) Bubble chart showing top 10 disease ontology (DO) terms, with the bubble size corresponding to number of genes associated with individual DO terms.  

With the availability of multi-omics data for human Rloop regulators, we were prompted to establish regulatory connections between individual R-loops and their regulators. The differential R-loop peaks following knockdown are likely targets of the corresponding regulator. In addition, R-loops may be directly modulated through chromatin or RNA binding activity of their regulators. Accordingly, we cataloged putative targeted R-loops for 52 validated Rloop regulators based on knockdown, ChIP-seq or CLIPseq data (Materials and Methods and Figure 3D). Importantly, these regulatory connections were well aligned with the existing lab results. We got 175 validated R-loop forming regions targeted by one of $52\mathrm{R}$ -loop regulators (Materials and Methods and Table S4). Although the existing experimental data were mostly from cell lines different with ours, we observed good validation rates for many regulators. For example, about half of the experimentally-verified R-loop targets are well-supported for BRCA1 $(69\%,9/13)$ , SMN1 $57\%$ , 8/14), SIN3A $(50\%,4/8)$ , U2AF1 $(50\%,2/4)$ and etc. Therefore, the regulatory relationship we deduced here is a good starting point for mechanistic understanding of Rloop regulation. With our data, we discovered that a few proteins may be master R-loop regulators as they targeted thousands of high-confidence R-loops (Figure 3E). Nine regulators have both ChIP-seq and CLIP-seq data available, allowing us to explore their regulatory mechanism. Interestingly, although these are typical RNA binding proteins, their chromatin binding rather than RNA binding activity are in general more associated with high-confidence Rloops (Figure 3F). This finding contradicts with the view that RNA binding proteins counteract R-loop formation by binding to RNA (4), yet instead suggests RNA binding proteins may regulate gene expression and R-loop dynamics through direct association with chromatin (6,31). More follow-up mechanistic studies are thus needed to resolve the puzzle.  

We further investigated the relevance of R-loop regulators to human diseases, in hope of opening new avenues for future disease mechanism research from the perspective of R-loops. Malfunction of R-loop regulators was significantly associated with human diseases. Of 186 validated human R-loop regulators, 128 are associated with human diseases, significantly higher than background (Monte Carlo simulation, $P$ -value $<0.001$ ). Besides cancers, neurological diseases in a broad sense, including ataxia telangiectasia and lateral sclerosis, were among the most enriched disease ontology terms (Figure 3G; Materials and Methods). It shall be interesting to interrogate why and how neural cells are specifically less tolerant of deficiency of R-loop regulators.  

# R-loopBase development for R-loop studies in a wellannotated genomic context  

To maximize the usefulness of R-loop zones and regulators described above, we characterized them by integrating multiple categories of functional genomic annotations (Materials and Methods and Figure 4A). First, previous studies have linked R-loop formation with specific genomic features, the integration of which may help evaluate independently whether R-loop peaks detected by individual technologies or R-loop zones defined by our integrative analysis are true or not. To this end, we integrated the predicted R-loop forming sequences (81), and computed GC content, GC skew and AT skew, and predicted G4 motifs. As not all G4 motifs permit G4 formation in vivo and G4 structures may involve atypical motifs (90), we thus integrated G4 structures mapped with ChIP-seq technology as well. R-loop detection can rely on the identification of the displaced ssDNA. The binding profile of ssDNA-binding protein RPA was previously suggested as an alternative method to locate R-loops (4), so we also collected public RPA ChIP-seq data. R-loop formation is clearly a consequence of transcription, and histone marks can be taken as a proxy of transcription or chromatin status especially when transcription data are not available. Therefore, GRO-seq and PRO-seq data, and 29 types of histone modifications were integrated from ENCODE project (67) and elsewhere. R-loop formation is coupled with local unmethylated status of the genomic DNA (21), prompting us to further integrate whole genome bisulfide sequencing data. Hybrids between template DNA and RNA primers during DNA replication might be captured, we therefore also integrated replication timing data (91). Second, for individual R-loop regulators, we collected and organized gene annotations from HUGO, NCBI and GeneCards. We also annotated each regulator with its supporting evidences, molecular function for Rloop regulation and putative R-loop targets (Supplementary Table S3). As R-loop regulators are in general associated with human diseases (Figures 3G), to better facilitate functional study in a specific disease or cell model, we annotated their expression in normal and cancerous tissues, as well as cell lines from GTEx (83), TCGA (84) and CCLE (85) projects. Overall, about 300 datasets from ten broad categories were integrated (Figure 4A and Supplementary Table S5), generating billions of functional annotations.  

To support the data management and to better serve the R-loop community, we developed R-loopBase platform with multiple user-friendly interactive interfaces (Figures 4B and 5). First, ID- and location-based query systems were developed for searching human R-loop forming regions (Figure 5A). For each query, statistics of R-loop zones are shown with an UpSet plot (Figure 5B). Displayed below are R-loopBase R-loop zones of different confidence levels, each of which can be accessed through the drop-down menu (Figure 5C). For each R-loop zone, the supporting technologies, cell lines in which it is detected and its known regulators are listed in detail (Figure 5C). Users will be further directed to R-loopBase genome browser via the hyperlinked genomic coordinate for visualization of R-loops in the wellannotated genomic context (Figure 5D). Alternatively, ID-, location- and sequence-based queries are supported by RloopBase genome browser for visual inspection of R-loop zones. Clearly, along with the increase of confidence level, R-loop zones are growingly narrowed down and increasingly associated with well-known R-loop-related features, such as GC skew, G4 formation and local transcriptional activity (Figure 5D). The R-loopBase genome browser also allows direct comparison among R-loops identified by individual technologies and other genomic features.

Figure 4. R-loopBase data integration and interface development. (A) A matrix showing the datasets integrated in R-loopBase, with columns corresponding to different cell types and rows corresponding to different types of genomics data. Data sources for expression profiles of R-loop regulators are shown in the dialog box. \*Including 1,185 regulators in human, 24 in mouse, 63 in yeast and 21 in $E.$ . coli. (B) The overall framework of R-loopBase database. Datasets in (A) are systematically processed, updated and managed in R-loopBase (top left) and could be directly downloaded for genome-wide analysis (top right). In addition, through the query system (middle), all datasets could be retrieved for display on R-loop page, regulator page or genome browser (bottom).  

Second, by following the hyperlink associated with a specific R-loop regulator, users can also be directed from the R-loop page to the regulator page (Figures 4B and 5C), which provides regulator-centric view of R-loopBase annotations. Besides, ID-, species- or expression-based query systems were also developed for searching R-loop regulators in specific species or with specific gene expression profile (Figure 5E). For a given R-loop regulator, four categories of gene annotations are provided (Figure 5F), i.e., basic information from public databases, supporting evidences and functions of R-loops, putative R-loop targets and gene expression profiles. We also implemented an interface for R-loopBase team members and users to independently update annotations for R-loop regulators to ensure the accuracy and completeness (Figure 4B, top left). Similar to Rloop pages, regulator pages are also cross-referenced with R-loop pages and the R-loopBase genome browser. In particular, a regulator track showing DNA or RNA binding sites and regulated R-loop regions are provided on the RloopBase genome browser. Such information may guide the future investigations of the regulatory mechanism of individual R-loop loci.

# DISCUSSION  

Rapid advances in R-loop research have tremendously broadened our knowledge of R-loop regulation and function, but also led to confusions due to large discrepancies in data-driven discoveries revealed by different R-loop mapping technologies. The massive set of R-loop mapping data however has not been systematically collected and analyzed, to allow the community to easily access and compare them, thus taking full advantage of the information behind. We attempted to address this by developing R-loopBase. We integrated R-loop sequencing data in human cells generated by all 11 different technologies published to date and hundreds of R-loop-related genomics datasets. By doing so, RloopBase functions nicely in direct comparison among different R-loop mapping technologies, and to bridge gaps between mapped R-loops at individual genomic loci and related sequence and biochemical properties. We have further endeavored to define confidence levels for mapped R-loops according to the number of technologies by which they are supported. This unique function of R-loopBase is very helpful for selecting R-loops of high confidence for functional studies. Furthermore, the regulatory mechanism for R-loop homeostasis remains elusive. By our systematic effort to collect, annotate and categorize 1293 potential R-loop regulators from literature, we provide a global view of the Rloop regulatory network for the first time. These efforts not only allow users to access regulators with various types of supporting evidence or expression profile for their own research, but also link to the regulatory mechanism and disease relevance.  

To the best of our knowledge, there are two other Rloop databases, i.e., R-loopDB (81) and R-loop Atlas (http: //bioinfor.kib.ac.cn/R-loopAtlas). R-loopDB is a collection of predicted R-loop forming sequences in eight species, and human and mouse R-loops mapped via DRIP-seq, DRIPcseq or RDIP-seq. R-loop Atlas is a specialized database for R-loops in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa, which contains R-loops mapped mainly via the ssDRIP-seq. A few key features well distinguish R-loopBase from these two databases. First, R-loopBase has the most comprehensive collection of R-loops in human. R-loopBase integrates predicted R-loops by R-loopDB, and archives human R-loop mapping datasets generated by all 11 different technologies. Second, sequence-based R-loop prediction may miss  

R-loops with atypical sequence features (Figure 2H), and different R-loop mapping technologies usually generate inconsistent R-loop maps (Figure 1). It is thus not so straightforward to know the authority of a predicted or experimental R-loop from R-loopDB or R-loop Atlas. In contrast, R-loopBase presents a reference set of human R-loops and assign it with 9 different confidence levels based on integrative analysis of all R-loop mapping datasets. Moreover, RloopBase integrates hundreds of R-loop-related genomics datasets, which collectively enable customized evaluation of the likelihood for R-loop formation at a specific genomic locus. Third, R-loop regulome is missing in either R-loopDB or R-loop Atlas. R-loopBase fills this gap by collecting and annotating a complete list of known R-loop regulatory proteins and their targeted R-loops. Users can easily get access to these resources for mechanistic and disease studies from the perspectives of R-loops.  

Lastly, there is still room for further development of RloopBase. The current release of R-loopBase is largely built on human R-loop data, mainly because only human cells have enough data for integrative analysis. However, since Rloops are conserved from bacteria to human, it would be important to include other species to study R-loops from the evolutionary point of view. While we collected R-loop regulators for three more species in addition to human, a reference set of R-loops for each species will be analyzed and presented when more genome-wide R-loop mapping data and functional genomics data are available. More importantly, as R-loops are dynamically regulated in a variety of physiological processes important for development and disease progression, our approach of defining high-confidence Rloops may miss out cell- or condition-specific R-loops under dynamic control. It is thus necessary to include R-loop dynamics data and develop novel method for precise R-loop mapping in the future. Of note, only a small fraction of Rloop regulators has been functionally validated. An even a smaller number of proteins have genomic target information available. More efforts are clearly needed to fully dissect the complex and region-specific mechanism of R-loop regulation. With continuous updates, R-loopBase will become more and more powerful as a one-stop interface to serve the community in the future.

# ABSTRACT  

Flowering is a hot topic in Plant Biology and important progress has been made in Arabidopsisthaliana toward unraveling the genetic networks involved. The increasing complexity and the explosion of literature however require development of new tools for information management and update. We therefore created an evolutive and interactive database of flowering time genes, named FLOR-ID (FloweringInteractive Database), which is freely accessible at http://www.flor-id.org. The hand-curated database contains information on 306 genes and links to 1595 publications gathering the work of $>4500$ authors. Gene/protein functions and interactions within the flowering pathways were inferred from the analysis of related publications, included in the database and translated into interactive manually drawn snapshots.  

# INTRODUCTION  

The timing of flowering significantly affects plant fitness and crop yield so that the understanding of the underlying mechanisms is a primary source for further improvement of agricultural productivity. Reproductive success requires synchronization with seasonal cycling, thus plants have evolved a complex network of regulatory pathways to sense and integrate external and endogenous signals. Among the environmental cues, daylength and temperature are the main determinants of flowering time (1). As a result, pioneering forward genetic studies focused on the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana led to the categorization of flowering-time mutants according to their altered sensitivity to photoperiod (‘photoperiodic pathway’) and to winter cold (‘vernalization pathway’) (2,3). Mutants that were late flowering but remained sensitive to both environmental factors were classified in an ‘autonomous pathway’ whereas the limiting effect of gibberellins, a group of phytohormones, gave its name to the the ‘gibberellin pathway’ (4–6). Until recently, the convergence of these four flowering pathways towards a few transcription factors, called ‘integrators’, was still the most visible crosstalk reflecting the fine-tuning of flowering time by known stimuli (7).  

The view of flowering time control has however exploded over the last years and a picture of great complexity is emerging (8). First, dissection of the genetic networks underlying the pathways revealed multiple links between their components, such as light signaling and circadian timing in the photoperiodic pathway (9), which explained the pleiotropic phenotypes of some flowering-time mutants (10,11). Second, the identification of RNA processing and epigenetic regulation as major mechanisms of the autonomous and vernalization pathways revealed actors with rather generic roles and even became instrumental in unraveling new layers of gene regulation in plants (12,13). Third, additional pathways were uncovered after the investigation of the mechanisms promoting flowering in the absence of photoperiodic cues, as the plant ages or as the surrounding temperature rises (14–16). MicroRNAs were shown to have an important role (17), as well as sugar status and signaling (18–20) or other phytohormones (21,22).  

This fast progress clearly demonstrates that the genetic dissection of flowering time control was greatly facilitated by the focus on Arabidopsis. As the view of the process evolved from a set of discrete pathways toward a complex network of interconnected hubs, the number of genes involved increased from 80 (23) to 180 (24). The highly intricate nature of these genetic networks, together with the diversity of the experimental evidence supporting their building, create a need to have a consolidated basis on which new players will be added. The question is even more challenging as new -omics high-throughput technologies are being used. We therefore undertook the construction of a core database named FLOR-ID (Flowering-Interactive Database) that could be progressively and regularly updated on the basis of new knowledge. We performed a careful literature survey and created a curated database of 306 flowering-time genes in Arabidopsis. We developed this tool as a website, meeting its dynamic and evolutive aims. A collection of manually drawn snapshots provides an interactive user interface.  

# DATABASE CREATION  

# Identification of flowering-time associated genes  

The FLOR-ID database aims at gathering information about genes involved in the regulation of flowering time. We defined ‘flowering-time genes’ as genes whose mutation and/or overexpression alters flowering time in any Arabidopsis accession. We allocated those genes among seven pathways whereby flowering is regulated by: photoperiod, vernalization, aging, ambient temperature, hormones, sugar or autonomously. Genes under the control of several converging pathways were defined as ‘flowering-time integrators’.  

To draw up an exhaustive list of flowering-time genes in Arabidopsis, we merged the results of four complementary approaches: (i) we started with a gene list published by Fornara et al. (24); (ii) we searched the UniProt database (http://www.uniprot.org) (25) for all the Arabidopsis proteins associated with the keyword ‘flowering’, excluding those isolated from pleiotropic mutants; (iii) we performed a literature search in NCBI PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm. nih.gov/pubmed), limited to the publications of the last 10 years; (iv) we analyzed recent reviews on the topic. More details are provided as Supplementary Material S1, including the full list of the reviews (8–11, 13–17, 22, 24, and supplementary references 28–114).  

# Gene information retrieval  

For each identified flowering-time gene, we retrieved the relevant publications by querying TAIR10 (http://www. arabidopsis.org) (26), PubMed and Google Scholar (http: //scholar.google.com) with the AGI locus identifier or the gene name(s). We narrowed these publication collections to the most representative and informative articles by primarily retaining those describing the cloning of the gene(s) or specifically dedicated to flowering time. When necessary, a further round of selection followed to keep most recent articles and/or those having a high number of citations.  

The resulting compilation of more than 3000 full-text PDF files was then analyzed to find information about the phenotypes of the mutants, overexpressors and other transgenic lines. This was performed by contextual searches using FoxTrot Professional Search (CTM Development). Each phenotype was associated with the corresponding publication(s) and, when available, complementary information was added such as the growth conditions used for mutant phenotyping and functional data on the encoded protein. Genes were further sorted according to the flowering pathway in which they are primarily involved.  

# Database structure  

All collected information about the flowering-time genes was incorporated into a normalized MySQL relational database: FLOR-ID (Figure 1). In addition to the information gathered from our literature survey, we used the AGI locus identifier and the reference PubMed ID to link

# USER INTERFACE  

A freely accessible website was designed as a user frontend of FLOR-ID (http://www.flor-id.org). The database can be consulted by two ways: pre-compiled tabulated views and interactive schemes featuring flowering pathways and gene interactions.  

# Tabulated data  

The raw content of the database is available through three thematic tables focused respectively on genes, publications and authors. Data can be further filtered by any textual variable and thereafter exported as text (CSV), Excel or PDF files. On a gene-by-gene basis, the ‘Gene Details’ pages of FLOR-ID give access to phenotypes of mutants and overexpressors, publications, protein function and interactors of the selected gene. ‘Interactors’ here refers to genes that have been shown to act upstream or downstream of the selected gene, whether their interaction is direct or not, or to proteins if protein-protein interactions were demonstrated (Figure 2). FLOR-ID also supports programmatic extraction of information for meta-analysis purposes. Custom URL addresses are used to access the gene information as eXtended Markup Language (XML) or JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files. For instance, retrieving information about FLOWERING LOCUS T, (AT1G65480) in an XML format is done with the URL http://www.phytosystems.ulg. ac.be/florid/details/?gene $\c=$ AT1G65480&type=xml.

# Interactive schemes  

To give a visual structure to the FLOR-ID database, we produced snapshots illustrating different levels of complexity and enabling interactive access to the data. The snapshots are based on a careful analysis of the literature and supported by experimental evidence. One overview level, seven flowering pathways and two complementary pictures on circadian clock and flower development are connected to detailed nested schemes (37 in total). In each scheme, interactions between genes or proteins are shown by different line types and ending styles. From a technical point of view, FLOR-ID houses the schemes as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). SVG’s are natively supported in every modern browser (Chrome 43, Firefox 38, Safari 8, Internet Explorer 11). Their vectorial nature ensures a minimal loading time. It also enables the tagging of each individual element (gene or line) which, combined with modern web technologies (JavaScript), makes the schemes fully interactive (Figure 3). As a result, users can access the information stored in the underlying database by clicking on any element: gene names direct to mutant phenotypes, locus information and key publications, while lines and arrows lead to the papers that provided evidence for the interactions shown. This chain of information is displayed in a dynamic lateral panel. This panel also contains links to external resources (TAIR10, UniProt and direct links to the publications). All snapshots can be downloaded as PDF files.  

# DATA CURATION  

The curation of the FLOR-ID database is manual by design and was performed by the authors. Manual curation filters the information contained in the database with strong, peerreviewed experimental data and ensures its quality. Most importantly, all gene and protein interactions shown in the interactive snapshots are supported by experimental data whereas interactions inferred from -omics approaches are mainly predictive.  

The flowering community is large and active. In order to leverage its assets, we created a user form allowing to suggest modifications and submit new genes, connections or publications. In a first step, this information will be displayed in a provisional table. In a second step, the database curators will validate the new item. Finally, the update will be incorporated to the public version of the database.  

# CONCLUSIONS AND PROSPECTS  

Information management is a challenge as new biology approaches disclose increasing levels of complexity and regulatory networks. Evolutive databases provide a mean to cope with the increasing amount of data and to gather information from the scientific community. Tools exist to

manage raw experimental data sets, but literature is similarly exploding. The core of FLOR-ID is build around the flowering-time gene networks and contains hand-curated data. It therefore offers a reliable tool to define flowering time genes in comparative genomic studies or transcriptomic analyses. Complementary plugins can be created to extend its functionality even further, e.g. for mapping raw gene expression data onto the flowering pathways.  

The content of the FLOR-ID database could be easily incremented with modules expanding beyond flowering time, for example to gametophyte development. The curation of the database could then be shared between different laboratories in order to provide expert updates and ensure content accuracy. We thus hope that FLOR-ID will give the impetus to a collective, shared and structuring approach of literature and knowledge recording. Such initiative will logically contribute to community resources like Araport (27).

# ABSTRACT  

Scents are well known to be emitted from flowers and animals. In nature, these volatiles are responsible for inter- and intra-organismic communication, e.g. attraction and defence. Consequently, they influence and improve the establishment of organisms and populations in ecological niches by acting as single compounds or in mixtures. Despite the known wealth of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from species of the plant and animal kingdom, in the past, less attention has been focused on volatiles of microorganisms. Although fast and affordable sequencing methods facilitate the detection of microbial diseases, however, the analysis of signature or fingerprint volatiles will be faster and easier. Microbial VOCs (mVOCs) are presently used as marker to detect human diseases, food spoilage or moulds in houses. Furthermore, mVOCs exhibited antagonistic potential against pathogens in vitro, but their biological roles in the ecosystems remain to be investigated. Information on volatile emission from bacteria and fungi is presently scattered in the literature, and no public and up-to-date collection on mVOCs is available. To address this need, we have developed mVOC, a database available online at http://bioinformatics. charite.de/mvoc.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Microorganisms are universal in the biosphere. They are often found in large quantities and diverse compositions (microbiome). For example, there are more microorganisms $(\sim2\mathrm{kg})$ than human cells in humans, and most of them are essential and useful for the human host vitality (1). Bacteria are also dominant inhabitants of the leaf surfaces $(10^{7}\mathrm{\cells}/\mathrm{cm}^{2})$ and they are prominent in the soil, e.g. $_{\textrm{1g}}$ of soil contains ${\sim}10^{\tilde{1}1}$ microbial cells (2).  

It is well known that microbes produce a diversity of natural compounds, e.g. antibiotics. Interestingly, the small molecular mass substances released by microorganisms were often overlooked, partially due to the lack of appropriate absorption and detection technologies. Many of these small molecules $\left(<300\mathrm{Da}\right)$ exhibit high-vapour pressures and low boiling points, and, together with a lipophilic character, these features support volatility.  

In the past decade, research on microbial smells experienced a renaissance owing to their global appearance. Some examples of bacterial volatile emissions are mentioned here. Undoubtedly, prominent malodorous volatiles are produced by microorganisms during the process of putrefaction (e.g. amines, sulphur compounds, indole and ammonia) (3), whereas the aromas of wines, sauerkraut, cheese and other milk product fermentations are usually recognized as pleasant by human noses (e.g. acids, alcohols and esters). The earthy and muddy smell of wet forest soils is due to the emission of the volatile geosmin released by Streptomyces species (4–6). Microbiologists typically recognize the characteristic smell of indole from Escherichia coli. The human microbial flora at any given anatomical site is relatively specifically accompanied by a typical volatile organic compound (VOC) profile (e.g. oral and breath malodour, smell of sputum VOCs, gases released by the gut, sweat and sebum smell and foot odour). The VOC mixture of breath originates from more than one source within the respiratory system (e.g. tongue, oropharynx and bronchioles), and respiratory disorders can result in odorous gases being expelled into the air, which can be useful for diagnostic purposes (3). For example, to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis, methyl nicotinate showed promising results to be used as a non-invasive and rapid diagnostic tool, or the emission of 2-nonanone of Pseudomonas aeruginosa VOCs may be used as in vivo marker to detect lung infections (7). Freshly secreted sweat is sterile, but due to biotransformation by microorganisms (aerobic coryneforms, propionibacteria and Micrococcaceae), odoriferous VOCs are produced. Another example is wound infection: when a wound is formed, it is a new ecological niche favourable to microbial growth. Research is ongoing to develop a ‘wound sniffing’ device that discriminates between wound-related and -unrelated volatiles. Volatiles, particularly off-flavours, are also fingerprints to screen systematically for spoiled foodstuff or to identify hidden microbial growth in buildings (8,9). Furthermore, in the past few years, the interest of researchers studying the effects of microbial VOCs (mVOCs) on plants has become increasingly evident, showing that some rhizobacteria release a blend of volatile components that promote growth of Arabidopsis thaliana (10), whereas others inhibit or are toxic for plants (11–14). It is also well documented that $\mathrm{\mVOCs}$ are important factors in mediating specific microbial interactions; in fact, intra- or inter-species interactions between bacteria and fungi in the soil result in morphological and phenotypical alterations of the receiving organism (15). There are numerous instances of $\mathrm{{\mVOCs}}$ being closely associated with insect feeding behaviours, and other microbial volatiles are also known as powerful repellants (16). Moreover, some volatile compounds such as higher alcohols (2-methyl-1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol and isobutanol) can be used as biofuels (17); however, considering the fact that the natural microbial production rates are too low to support industrial production, metabolic engineering is widely used to improve the production (17,18, http: $\bar{//\mathrm{dx.doi.org}}/10.5772/52\bar{0}50)$ .  

These are just a few examples of the up to now known 349 bacteria and 69 fungi that are volatile emitters. Taking in considerations that to date ${\sim}10000$ microbial species are described and at least a million are expected to exist on earth, the VOC profiles of a surprisingly small number of microorganisms were investigated so far. The VOC spectra of microorganisms are species-specific and can be simple or complex (19). The qualitative and quantitative composition of an mVOC profile is variable, depending on growth conditions (temperature, oxygen availability, pH), the carbon source availability and the age of the culture (3,20–24). Ultimately, the volatile emission profile is a consequence of specific metabolic activities of the particular microorganism.  

Considering the importance and the central roles of mVOCs in our biosphere, our objective was the establishment of a database of microbial volatiles for public use. Here, we present for the first time a user-friendly compilation of the microbial volatiles extracted from the literature. Originally, only mVOCs were filed using the Pubchem ID as an essential criterion. During the literature search, it turned out that many mVOCs have not received a Pubchem ID, but might be biologically relevant. Therefore, these compounds were also included into the database. Mixtures of $\mathrm{{\mVOCs}}$ are composed of various chemical classes, e.g. low molecular weight fatty acids and their derivatives (hydrocarbons, alcohols, aldehydes and ketones), terpenoids, aromatic compounds, nitrogen containing compounds and volatile sulphur compounds (15,25). To date, ${\sim}1000$ volatiles are filed in the mVOC database. References are given to each bacterial and fungal strain or isolate presented in the database. The user interface offers several search options, for instance, by species name, Pubchem ID, structure, molecular weight and logP value. Online upload is possible, allowing a timely incorporation of new data sets, which is expected to happen progressively in this fast-growing research field.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

The data were acquired by an extensive literature search available on PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ pubmed). Most of the information on mVOCs was found in ${\sim}20$ journals and the full-text of ${\sim}100$ articles was yielding most of the results compiled in the $\mathrm{\mVOC}$ database. The literature was manually screened by biochemists. To update mVOC in the future, literature will continuously be screened and data will be checked by a chemist or biochemist before entering them manually to the database.  

For conducting the similarity search of the compounds, the chemoinformatics package MyChem (http://mychem. sourceforge.net/) is integrated into the database. It enables the analysis and conversion of chemical data using OpenBabel (http://openbabel.org/) functionality. For the purpose of calculating the Tanimoto coefficient (26), it is obligatory to assign fingerprints to the compounds. This step is also performed by the MyChem package. Thereto, OpenBabel uses the Daylight theory for fingerprints (http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.  

finger.html). For the similarity determination between the compound of interest and the compounds of the mVOC database, the Tanimoto coefficient is the measure of choice:  

$$
\mathrm{Tanimoto~coefficient}_{A,B}=\frac{A B}{A+B-A B}
$$  

Bits of the binary fingerprint vectors were set to one in compound $A$ and compound $B$ as well as bits were set to one in both compounds and used for the calculation. The values calculated by the Tanimoto coefficient range between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates similar structures and 0 means that no similarity is found between the fingerprint representations of the molecules. Referring to the ‘similarity property principle’ (27), compounds that are structurally similar should exhibit a similar biological function. Nevertheless, small structural modifications can change the biological activity of the molecules dramatically (28). However, a Tanimoto coefficient ${>}0.85$ implies that the compared compounds may have a similar biological activity (29).  

As an applet for sketching compounds for the ‘Structure Search’ and ‘Add a new mVOC’ function, the open-source web-component ChemDoodle is implemented on the mVOC website. ChemDoodle is also used for a 3D visualization of the mVOC structure. ChemDoodle guarantees smooth usage on different platforms.  

For retrieving Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, a similarity search between the $846\ensuremath{\mathrm{~mVOCs}}$ and the 200 000 compounds from the SuperTarget database (30) was carried out. This step was conducted to obtain information on synthesis/degradation of the mVOCs as well as potential target interactions. Compounds were considered when the Tanimoto coefficient of the similarity pair between volatile and SuperTarget compound was at least 0.85. Those compounds were mapped onto the pathway maps. Additionally, mVOCs were mapped to KEGG compounds and are also displayed on the pathway maps. The database features pathways of species available in the database. The mapped pathways are visualized by web service.  

The mVOC database is implemented as a relational database on a MySQL server. Php and javascript have been used to build the website. Web access is enabled by Apache HTTP Server 2.  

# RESULTS  

With a number of 846 compounds and 5431 synonyms, which are assigned to 349 bacterial and 69 fungi species, mVOC is the first online database containing information about $\mathrm{{\mVOCs}}$ and their emitting organisms.  

# Search options  

The database provides several possibilities to search for compounds (Figure 1). On the one hand, a form (‘browse mVOC’) is available, and the user can choose to search by PubChem-ID, name or molecular formula. In addition, compounds can be searched by selecting a range of properties like molecular weight, logP values or by specific chemical groups (e.g. alkenes), by species, by the microorganisms’ kingdom and by a combination of these parameters. Furthermore, compounds can be searched by structural similarity (‘Structure Search’) including substructure search. For this purpose, a molecular structure is necessary to be known. The compound of interest is screened against the database by calculating the Tanimoto coefficient between the composed compound and all compounds of the mVOC database. Finally, the user can draw a compound with the embedded ChemDoodle interface (http://www.chemdoodle.com) or upload its MOL file. In addition to that, a possibility of browsing the mVOC database is given under the form ‘browse mVOC’. The database can be browsed by initial letters or chemical groups.  

![](images/bd4a3e9491632297fbce3e4857dc148ecf7c163caab3383cf7a05dd315c3fd5d.jpg)  
Figure 1. The mVOC database offers different search options. mVOC search: a general search form for mVOCs based on PubChem ID, name, several molecular properties as well as species. The result table is directly retrieved. Structure search: interactively drawing a structure and performing a structure or substructure search. The result table shows volatile compounds similar to the search entry (similarity search) or volatile compounds including a substructure that is similar to the search entry (substructure search). By clicking on ‘Information’, one will be directed to the result table of the mVOC. Signatures: the signature table shows all species emitting the same compounds as the chosen species. Compounds emitted by just one species are highlighted in green. KEGG pathways: cutout of the 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism pathway.  

# Search results  

The resulting report of ‘browse mVOC’ shows information about the compounds including name, synonyms, Pubchem-ID and structural information of the mVOC of interest (Figure 1). Additionally, microorganisms emitting the compound, the effect of the compound on other organisms, the respective methods for retrieving the compounds and the corresponding references are displayed. The search results for the ‘Structure Search’ are represented in order of similarity with information given about the calculated Tanimoto coefficient, PubChem-ID, name and 2D structure. The button ‘Information’ provides detailed information about the mVOCs that are similar to the query compound.  

# Biological interpretation  

The website features the use of KEGG pathway maps (http://www.kegg.jp/) through Web service. KEGG pathway maps supply knowledge about metabolic pathways as well as compound target interactions and offer a possibility for biological interpretation (Figure 1). Compounds of the mVOC database are mapped onto the pathways showing information about metabolic pathways providing an opportunity for further analysis. Moreover, an investigation of medical effects is also possible. A link to gene or gene clusters responsible for mVOC production will be included in future versions of this database.  

Another important feature is a ‘signature table’ of an organism of choice (Figure 1). After selecting a species from the bacterial or fungal species dropdown menu from ‘browse mVOC’, a ‘signature’ button is available on top of the result page. The ‘signature table’ plots the emitted mVOCs of the chosen species compared with all microbial species, which emit these mVOCs. The table shows the uniqueness of the compounds, which is, for example, important for distinguishing between (more or less pathogenic) species.  

# Database extension  

To enlarge the mVOC database, an upload function ‘Add new mVOCs’ is included (Figure 1). The user can upload a compound by drawing its structure with the ChemDoodle application. After uploading the compound, it will be verified by biochemists, and after being proofed as mVOC, it will be included into the database. Users are also encouraged to contact the authors when new volatile spectra are ready to be uploaded.  

# DISCUSSION  

Microbes make up the majority of the world’s biomass; their numbers and diversity greatly surpass those of all other organisms (31). Microbial chemical ecology is an important part of our life, and the analysis of the microbiome and unravelling its physiology including immune response, metabolism as well as pathology are future goals (32). Although sequencing becomes cheaper, an analysis of volatiles will always be faster and less invasive. Therefore, the $\mathrm{\mVOC}$ database is an indispensable platform for this burgeoning field of microbial volatiles. Interest is particularly focussed on the identification of ‘signature volatiles’ of human, animal and plant pathogenic species (33). Based on these results, new possibilities for using diagnostic tools can be considered. The application of volatile antibiotics can also be envisioned.

# ABSTRACT  

With the technology’s accessibility and ease of use, CRISPR has been employed widely in many different organisms and experimental settings. As a result, thousands of publications have used CRISPR to make specific genetic perturbations, establishing in itself a resource of validated guide RNA sequences. While numerous computational tools to assist in the design and identification of candidate guide RNAs exist, these are still just at best predictions and generally, researchers inevitably will test multiple sequences for functional activity. Here, we present dbGuide(https://sgrnascorer.cancer.gov/dbguide), a database of functionally validated guide RNA sequences for CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout in human and mouse. Our database not only contains computationally determined candidate guide RNA sequences, but of even greater value, over 4000 sequences which have been functionally validated either through direct amplicon sequencing or manual curation of literature from over 1000 publications. Finally, our established framework will allow for continual addition of newly published and experimentally validated guide RNA sequences for CRISPR/Cas9- based knockout as well as incorporation of sequences from different gene editing systems, additional species and other types of site-specific functionalities such as base editing, gene activation, repression and epigenetic modification.  

# INTRODUCTION  

CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing has been an indispensable technology for understanding the biology of living organisms (1,2). As a result, a tremendous effort has been invested in aiding researchers in designing and executing CRISPR-based experiments by providing critical resources such as reagents and protocols as well as software tools that allow a user to rapidly identify guide RNA sequences with specific predicted on-target and off-target characteristics (3–18) (Table 1). However, these sequences are essentially predictions, often requiring assessment of multiple candidate guide RNAs.  

Over the last 7 years, there has been an explosion of literature utilizing CRISPR/Cas9 to knockout specific genes or genomic regions, of which the majority is in human or mouse model systems. The culmination of all of this work has provided an opportunity to mine this information for guide RNA sequences shown to be functional at either a genotypic and/or phenotypic level. Variation in reporting standards, typographical errors and relegation of sequences into supplementary materials are among a few reasons why curation of this information has been non-trivial.  

To this end, we present dbGuide, a database of functionally validated guide RNA sequences for CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockout experiments in human or mouse cells (http: //sgrnascorer.cancer.gov/dbguide). We have manually curated guide RNA sequences from over 1000 peer-reviewed articles with each sequence having direct reference to the original publication. We are also making results of targeted amplicon sequencing for ${\sim}2000$ unique sgRNA sequences tested individually in human (293T) or mouse (NIH-3T3 or P19) cultured cells publicly searchable in our database. In total, these efforts encompass nearly 6000 unique guide RNA sequences for which some level of validated activity exists. To our knowledge, this represents the largest database of functionally validated guide RNA sequences. We expect this to be a continually growing resource through multiple mechanisms. We have provided a downloadable template to encourage researchers to submit their newly published/validated sequences and our computational framework will also allow for the inclusion of sequences for CRISPR systems other than for Streptococcus pyogenes, modalities such as base editing, gene activation/repression and epigenetic modifications, and sequences used in other species.

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

# Master list of human and mouse sgRNA sequences  

In addition to functionally validated sgRNA sequences, in order to provide further utility to the database, computationally designed sequences were also obtained from a variety of sources, primarily focused on protein-coding genes (17,19–26). These sources are listed in Supplementary Table S1. CSV-delimited files containing all sgRNA sequences present in our database for human (https: //sgrnascorer.cancer.gov/downloads/hg guide info.csv.gz) and mouse (https://sgrnascorer.cancer.gov/downloads/ mm guide info.csv.gz) can be downloaded directly from the dbGuide home page.  

# Published sgRNA sequences  

A broad search of the PubMed database for ‘CRISPR OR Cas9’ was performed and yielded over $15000$ indexed citations. Subsequently, review articles, publications not using human or mouse cells, publications not using S. pyogenes Cas9 and publications not performing knock-out experiments were excluded. In total, guide RNA sequences were sourced from a total of 1322 peer-reviewed articles (Supplementary Table S2) from which the guide RNA sequences used could be ascertained. Although it is likely some published sequences have been missed, a data template is provided for which these missed sequences can be submitted and incorporated into subsequent database updates.  

# Targeted amplicon sequencing data  

Quantitative editing data for nearly 2000 sgRNA sequences were generated internally from either transfection of Cas9/sgRNA plasmids $(1~\upmu\upvarrho)$ or Cas9 protein $(4~\upmu\mathrm{g})/i n$ vitro transcribed (IVT) $(2.25~\upmu\mathrm{g})$ RNA into mouse (NIH3T3 or P19) or human (HEK293T) cells in a 24-well format. Cas9 protein was produced using plasmid Addgene62731, a gift from Niels Geijsen (Addgene plasmid # 62731; http://n2t.net/addgene:62731; RRID:Addgene 62731) (27). IVT RNA was produced using a similar protocol as previously published (28). Cas9/RNP complexing and transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 were also performed similarly to as previously described (29). Polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA was performed and amplicons were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq V2 300 cycle kit using the PE $(2\times150)$ format. List of all sgRNAs sequences tested are listed in Supplementary Table S3.  

# Mapping information and on/off-target scoring metrics  

For all sgRNA sequences obtained, genomic locations of the corresponding target sites were obtained/verified using UCSC BLAT against either the $\log38$ or $\mathrm{mml}0$ reference genome sequences downloaded from the UCSC

Figure 1. Structure of the dbGuide database. (A) Components of the dbGuide database. The user interface was developed using html and javascript and the application is managed on an Apache web server using django. All underlying data is stored in a MariaDB (MySQL) database. (B) Schema of the MySQL database. Each species, currently limited to human and mouse, has a table of sgRNA sequences with pre-computed metrics and a table with gene annotation information. sgRNA sequences obtained from publications are stored in a single table and the ‘species’ field is used to determine which species the guide RNA was used. Similarly, sequences from targeted amplicon sequencing data also have the ‘species’ field for this purpose.  

Genome Browser (30,31). Subsequently, sgRNA locations were cross-referenced with the Gencode V32 (human) or Gencode VM23 (mouse) gene/transcript annotations to determine which transcript(s) each sgRNA could target.  

For on-target metrics, sgRNA Scorer 2.0 (32), Rule Set 2 (17) and FORECasT (33) scores were downloaded/calculated for each sgRNA and if a score could not be obtained, a value of ‘NV’ was denoted. For off-target analysis, Guidescan 1.0 (34) values were generated for each guide and similarly, for those guides for which a score could not be obtained, a value of ‘NV’ was given.  

# Analysis of targeted amplicon sequencing data  

Paired end raw FASTQ files were merged using FLASH (35), filtered for low quality bases, subsequently mapped to the designated genomic locations in $\mathrm{hg}38/\mathrm{mm}10$ using bwa mem, and then sorted and indexed bam files were generated using samtools (36). A custom python snakemake (37) pipeline was made to calculate non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) mutation frequencies. This analysis pipeline is publicly available at https://github.com/rajchari2/ ngs amplicon analysis.  

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  

dbGuide uses a simple HTML interface which utilizes the datatables and highcharts javascript libraries for displaying data in tabular and graphical formats, respectively (Figure 1A). The application is built in python using django with a MySQL database used for data storage and retrieval. The database can be accessed without e-mail registration or login.  

Within the MySQL relational database, for both human and mouse, there was central sgRNA table with genome target position and all metrics pre-calculated and a gene annotation table which has the location of all protein coding genes based on Gencode annotation. Finally, there are two separate tables for summarizing the amplicon sequencing data and the publication-validated sequences. A depiction of the schema is shown in Figure 1B.  

# Opening user interface

Figure 2. Screen shots of the key user interfaces. (A) Opening window of the dbGuide database. The user must first select whether to search within the human/mouse genome and then can specify a HGNC gene symbol, chromosomal coordinate in BED format, or ENSEMBL gene/transcript ID. (B) Window depicting results of a search by gene symbol. Selectable rows of sgRNA sequences are returned with various pre-computed metrics and PubMed identifiers, if the sequence had been used in a peer-reviewed publication. (C) Graphical representation of sgRNA sequences for which targeted amplicon sequencing data were generated. Stacked bar plots display the percentage of NHEJ mutation events that results in an ‘in-frame’ (black) or ‘out of frame’ (blue) amino acid change.  

mal position (in BED format), gene symbol, Ensembl gene or transcript ID, or an sgRNA spacer sequence (without the PAM). In addition, a link to an excel spreadsheet template is provided for researchers wishing to contribute to the database.  

# Search results when searching by gene/coordinate/accession  

Upon entering a valid search term, the user will be shown a table of results detailing all of the guide RNA sequences identified based on the search criteria (Figure 2B). The table displays the following columns:  

Gene-Symbol: most recent official gene symbol for a gene, guide rna: sgRNA spacer sequence (without PAM),  

crispr system: Cas9 ortholog, currently restricted to SpCas9,  

position: genomic location of the sgRNA target site in either human (hg38) or mouse $\mathrm{(mml0)}$ assembly  

in protein coding exon: whether the guide RNA targets a protein coding exon,  

num transcripts: the number of GENCODE transcripts targeted,  

transcript id list: list of GENCODE transcripts (by EN-SEMBL ID),  

sgrnascorer: predicted activity using the sgRNA Scorer 2.0 algorithm ( $-3$ to 3). Higher the value, greater the predicted activity,  

rule set 2: predicted activity using the Rule Set 2 algorithm (0–1). Higher the value, greater the predicted activity  

guide scan off: guidescan off-target score (0–1). Higher the value, higher the specificity  

forecast: Favored Outcomes of Repair Events at Cas9 targets (FORECasT) score for predicting mutational outcomes (in frame indel $\%$ , lower values preferred for knockouts),  

total nhej rate: if amplicon sequencing data exists, value between 0 and 100, or ‘None’ otherwise  

oof rate: out of frame mutation rate which is the proportion of mutated reads which would lead to an out of frame mutation  

num publications: number of published articles using the selected guide RNA sequence  

ind pmids: list of articles by PubMed ID which used selected guide RNA sequence  

num screens: number of pooled CRISPR screens in which the guide RNA sequences was enriched or depleted  

screen pmids: list of articles by PubMed ID of CRISPRbased pooled screens in which this guide was enriched or depleted  

sources: list of sources from which the guide RNA sequence has been curated from  

status  

status: if the sgRNA sequence was functionally validated in a publication or targeted amplicon sequencing data exists, it is termed ‘validated’. Otherwise, it is termed ‘design’. This field allows the user to rapidly filter the list of returned sequences by typing ‘validate’ in the upper-right search box.  

# Viewing sequence editing data  

In addition to sorting by total NHEJ rate, one can view the data in a graphical format. By selecting sgRNA sequences for which data exists, the user can click the ‘View Data’ which will show a stacked bar plot breaking down the total NHEJ rate between ‘in frame’ and ‘out of frame’ percentage (Figure 2C). This can be specifically important for knockout experiments where a higher out of frame (OOF) mutation percentage gives higher probability of protein loss.  

# Downloading sequences for use in experiments  

Upon identifying guide RNA sequences of interest, the user can export the sequences in a ‘ready to order’ format by clicking on the ‘Design’. A tab-delimited text file is generated listing oligonucleotides needed for either ligation into a plasmid or in vitro transcription as well as a PDF protocol describing what compatible vectors can be used and how they can be obtained. It is highly recommended to select and download multiple guide RNA sequences when performing knockout experiments to ensure any functional consequences observed may not be due to spurious off-target activity from a single guide RNA.

# ABSTRACT  

NBDB database describes protein motifs, elementary functional loops (EFLs) that are involved in binding of nucleotide-containing ligands and other biologically relevant cofactors/coenzymes, including ATP, AMP, ATP, GMP, GDP, GTP, CTP, PAP, PPS, FMN, FAD(H), NAD(H), NADP, cAMP, cGMP, c-di-AMP and c-di-GMP, ThPP, THD, F-420, ACO, CoA, PLP and SAM. The database is freely available online at http://nbdb.bii.a-star.edu.sg. In total, NBDB contains data on 249 motifs that work in interactions with 24 ligands. Sequence profiles of EFL motifs were derived denovofrom nonredundant Uniprot proteome sequences. Conserved amino acid residues in the profiles interact specifically with distinct chemical parts of nucleotide-containing ligands, such as nitrogenous bases, phosphate groups, ribose, nicotinamide, and flavin moieties. Each EFL profile in the database is characterized by a pattern of corresponding ligand–protein interactions found in crystallized ligand–protein complexes. NBDB database helps to explore the determinants of nucleotide and cofactor binding in different protein folds and families. NBDB can also detect fragments that match to profiles of particular EFLs in the protein sequence provided by user. Comprehensive information on sequence, structures, and interactions of EFLs with ligands provides a foundation for experimental and computational efforts on design of required protein functions.  

# INTRODUCTION  

Nucleotide-containing ligands are indispensable in various biochemical transformations taking place in living cells (1). The ligands are comprised of several common chemical parts: nitrogenous bases, phosphate groups, ribose sugar and other moieties such as flavin and nicotinaminde. The chemical structure of ligands, particularly the presence of phosphate groups is responsible for their universal biological functions. For instance, ATP is well known for providing energy to enzymatic reactions, DNA repair machinery, cell division and activation of motor proteins (2). Transfer of phosphate groups in protein phosphorylation is a key mechanism in cell signaling, and many of these ligands are co-enzymes and essential vitamins (3,4). Importance of nucleotide-containing ligands in bioenergetics is reflected in high conservation of protein–ligand interactions, some of them resembling primordial nucleotide–peptide interactions in the origin of life (2). Walker A motif (or P-loop) responsible for interactions with the phosphate in nucleotides was among the first to be detected as a signature of nucleotide binding (5) and shown to be highly conserved (5– 7). Sequence/structure determinants (8–10) of nucleotide binding along with evolutionary implications (11) have been considered for individual ligands (12–15) or small groups of them (16–18). Despite the great importance and in-depth studies of protein-DNA complexes reviewed elsewhere (19), comprehensive study of major nucleotide-containing ligands with description of their generic characteristics is still lacking. Crucial role of nucleotide-containing ligands in the diversity of cellular functions and rich evolutionary history of enzymes call for accurate and systematic study of these ligands and their interactions with different proteins. Based on the previous theoretical studies, it was hypothesized that all natural enzymes could be represented as combinations of elementary functional loops (EFLs)––presumable basic units of protein function (20,21). Therefore, it is of special interest to explore EFLs that specifically recognize ligands or interact with particular chemical groups, and to characterize their conserved contacts, functional signatures and sequence/structure determinants.  

We present here a database of 249 profiles of EFLs that are involved in binding of different parts of the $24~\mathrm{most}$ common nucleotide-containing ligands, including mononucleotides formed by nitrogenous bases adenosine, guanosine and cytosine: ATP, AMP, ATP, GMP, GDP, GTP, CTP and their derivatives PAP, PPS; flavin- and nicotinamidecontaining nucleotides and dinucleotides: FMN, FAD(H), NAD(H), NADP. Additionally, the database includes cyclic nucleotides and dinucleotides such as cAMP, cGMP, c-diAMP and c-di-GMP (22,23). For completeness we also include nucleotide-like molecules and coenzymes, such as ThPP, THD, F-420, ACO, CoA, PLP and SAM (for complete information on ligands see Supplementary Table S1 and ‘Help’ section on the NBDB website). The set of profiles of EFLs contains several very conserved archetypal signatures, for instance the generalized signatures GxxGxG and GxGxxG of phosphate binding in various nucleotides and dinucleotides, respectively. These patterns of glycines expose protein backbone in a particular way so that the main chain amide groups form hydrogen bonds with oxygens in ligand’s phosphate groups. Other EFLs may interact with several chemical groups simultaneously, thereby facilitating molecular recognition and binding of specific ligands. We present here an example of a protein interacting with CTP ligand, illustrating how combinations of EFLs can form interactions with different parts of ligands.  

The website http://nbdb.bii.a-star.edu.sg/ is a suite of interactive tools for exploratory analysis of ligands, profiles of EFLs and their interactions. Additionally, the search function allows one to identify ligand-binding sites in a given protein sequence. The NBDB database presented here can be used as a starting point in exploring different aspects of evolution of protein–nucleotide interactions, it can be of help in functional annotation of sequences and it can give valuable insights for designing the enzymes that bind specific ligands.  

# THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND COMPUTATIONAL METHODS  

Based on our previous theoretical studies we proposed that all natural enzymes could be represented as combinations of EFLs––presumable basic units of protein function (20,21). Elementary function (EF) is defined as a chemical reaction step in enzymatically catalyzed biochemical transformation or binding of a substrate, product or intermediate molecule (24). Structural carriers of elementary functions––EFLs are defined as closed loops (returns of the polypeptide chain (25,26)), possessing one or few functional residues and bringing them to protein’s active sites (20,21). Rigorous statistics of the PDB database prompted us to hypothesized that polymer nature of polypeptide chains determines common structural characteristics of EFLs: (i) shape – returns of the backbone; (ii) typical size of $25-$ 30 amino acid residues (25,26). Further, we found strong indications that the most common EFLs with very basic and omnipresent elementary functions are apparently descendants of prebiotic ring-like peptides, which gave rise to the first enzymatic domains in the origin of life (2). Representatives of these EFLs and their evolutionary prototypes (20,21) can be found in different protein families, superfamilies and folds (27), allowing one to unravel deep evolutionary connections in the modern-day protein universe (2). These connections showed that the evolution of protein function (28,29) is complex, and, in addition to domain recombination, may have been driven by recombination of functional segments between protein domains (2,27,30,31). However, the specificity of molecular interactions in evolutionary conserved prototypes (20) and omnipresence of their descendants in protein folds and functions motivated us to develop a computational procedure for their derivation that differs from ancestral reconstruction due to the absence of any phylogenetic assumptions (20,21). In general, this procedure can derive profiles of elementary functions on different levels of conservation, from the most generic evolutionary prototypes (20) found in distant functional superfamilies and even in different protein folds to specific profiles of elementary functions in particular protein families (2,27). In brief, the procedure can be described as an iterative de novo derivation of sequence profiles in the form of position-specific scoring matrices from a collection of nonredundant sequences from UniProt, followed by their hierarchical clustering. The procedure’s unique scoring function weights profile positions according to their information content, thus emphasizing on the importance of the functional signature. Due to the limited size of the profiles, the estimates of statistical significance of profilesequence matches are based on the empirical distribution of scores obtained for the profile with shuffled positions. Here, we report one-sided p-values calculated for the z-scores of profile-sequence matches. Complete description of the procedure is available elsewhere (21), some relevant details are also provided on the NBDB website.  

# DESCRIPTION OF THE DATABASE  

The database is designed to provide fast and efficient access to the collection of sequence profiles of EFLs that bind most-common nucleotides and nucleotide-containing ligands. In particular, the database describes atomistic details of all hydrogen bonds between proteins and their cognate ligands. Thus, each position of the EFL profile is annotated by its interactions with different parts of ligands: phosphate and sulfate groups; ribose and other sugars; adenine, guanine and cytosine nitrogenous bases; acetyl, flavin, nicotinamide, pyridoxal and thiamin moieties. The database allows exploring the profiles of EFLs by the interacting ligand and ligand part, e.g. ribose in ADP. Each protein– ligand interaction is annotated by representative structural matches collected in the PDB database, with interacting proteins classified according to SCOP (32). The database allows searching for known EFLs and ligand binding sites given a protein sequence of interest. Below is a description of different pages and options available in the database along with a brief note on the implementation and usage.

There are eight main types of pages: (A) Homepage, (B) Ligands, (C) SCOP families, (D) Search, (E) Help, (F) Ligand view, (G) Profile view with ligand, (H) Profile view. Arrows show options for moving from one part of the data to another.  

# MATERIALS AND METHODS  

Sequence origins for derivation of profiles of EFLs were obtained in two-step procedure from the PDB structures crystalized with the ligands of interest. First, the hydrogen bonding interactions were determined with the precise geometric criteria with tolerances of 0.4 angstroms and 20.0 degrees using UCSF Chimera v1.10.1 (33). Second, structural motifs that interact with the corresponding parts of ligands were determined and their sequences were used as origins in the profile derivation procedure. By following a procedure described in detail elsewhere (2,20) the origins were iteratively compared to Uniref50 sequences from UniProt release 2014 08 (34) as the nonredundant source of proteomic sequences, until they converged to sequence profiles.  

The database contains 249 profiles of EFLs interacting with different parts of the following 24 nucleotidecontaining ligands: AMP, ADP, ATP, GMP, GDP, GTP, CTP, CoA, Acelyl-CoA, FMN, F-420, FAD(H), NAD(H), NADP; cyclic nucleotides and dinucleotides: cAMP, cGMP, c-di-AMP, c-di-GMP; other biologically-relevant cofactors: SAM, PPS, PAP, PLP, ThPP, THD. According to SCOP (32) classification, representatives of ligand-binding EFLs are found in 74 folds, 84 superfamilies and 195 families.  

# STRUCTURE OF THE DATABASE AND WEBSITE NAVIGATION  

Figure 1 shows the database sitemap scheme with logical connections between the pages. There are eight main types of pages: (i) Homepage, (ii) Ligands page, (iii) SCOP families page, (iv) Search page, (v) Help page, (vi) Ligand view page, (vii) Profile with ligand view page, (viii) Profile view (without ligand) page. The main menu on top of each page provides links to (a–e).  

Homepage introduces user to the database and provides matrix navigation for an overview of all interactions in the database and quick access to the data. Its 24 rows designate the ligands and 249 columns correspond to the profiles of EFLs. Existing interactions between the profiles and ligands are marked by color. User can directly navigate to a profile’s page with all relevant information describing its interaction with a particular ligand of interest.  

Ligands page shows the list of all ligands described in the database, their 2D structures and describes molecular moieties of each ligand. Clicking on the ligand leads to the ‘Ligand view page’ with detailed information about the selected molecule. We grouped ligands into several overlapping classes displayed on top of the page and allow filtering the list instantaneously according to the selected ligand class.  

Ligand view page shows the 2D view of the particular ligand’s structure and allows user to select different chemical moieties of the ligand thereby focusing on interaction with a specific ligand’s part. The table in the ligand view page shows the list of profiles of EFLs that bind to any (or selected by user) part of the ligand.  

SCOP families page contains an interactive circular diagram that shows a distribution of EFL profiles classified according to the SCOP hierarchy: class (inner circle), fold (second), superfamily (third) and family (outer circle). The segment sizes are proportional to the numbers of profiles in each SCOP class, fold, superfamily or family. Clicking on a segment within the circle shows a table with the corresponding set of EFL profiles.  

Search page requires a single protein sequence in FASTA format as an input. Optionally, user can provide a protein name or UniProt accession number, and the sequence will be automatically fetched. The search works similar to RPSBLAST; it identifies all EFL profiles and visualizes a map of hits within the subject sequence. Each hit is also listed in the table. The profile-sequence search procedure is described elsewhere in detail (2). The p-value threshold is set to the recommended value of $10^{-7}$ in order to guarantee reliable output. Search takes less than a few seconds even for large sequences.  

Profile view page shows the EFL profile and all of its interactions. If the ligand is specified, it shows interactions with a particular ligand. The sequence profile is shown as a logo generated with the help of Weblogo software library (35). Profile name consists of the most conserved residues in its sequence signature. Profile can also be downloaded as a position frequency matrix. Below the profile, there is matrix of interactions with various ligands and their atoms aligned with corresponding positions of the profile. Colored cells in the matrix indicate interactions between protein motifs and atoms of the ligand. The color of a cell denotes different ligand moieties. Color intensity indicates the level of conservation of corresponding interactions. The ‘zoom in’ button below the ligand picture will show atom labels for the ligand. Circular diagram shows the distribution of families in SCOP for the EFL’s profile. If profile is shown in the context of a ligand, it will be illustrated by the structural examples for a particular ligand listed in the table. Otherwise an illustration of the profile’s structural representative is provided. In case the profile is displayed in the context of a ligand the table of structural examples includes the links to the PDB structure viewer. Additionally, PoseView (36) plots, which are downloaded directly from the PDB show 2D projections of all ligand–protein interactions in a given protein for the ligand of interest. Protein name input box accepts complex expressions with UniProt query syntax and allows a PDB identifier as an input, thus helping to identify all ligand-binding EFLs in a given structure.

# DATABASE USAGE  

Altogether, the data collected in this database provides a detailed picture of important interactions (and their sequence/structure determinants) that work in binding of nucleotide-containing ligands and biologically relevant cofactors. Below we describe an example of 2-C-methyl-Derythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase from Thermotoga maritima with bound Cytidine- $5^{\prime}$ -triphosphate (CTP). Figure 2 shows the protein structure (panel a) with three ligand-binding EFLs displayed as colored ribbons. Figure 2B is a zoom-in to the binding site with three motifs found by the profiles ‘GGRK’ (yellow), ‘HDRP’ (magenta) and ‘GNKTD’ (green) loops, respectively. Yellow loop interacts with three parts of the ligand: base, ribose and phosphate groups (Figure 2C and D). Magenta EFL (found by the ‘HDRP’ profile) interacts with ribose (magenta), and green EFL (‘GNKTD’ profile) makes contacts with phosphate groups via a water molecule. These three EFLs found in one protein illustrate a comprehensive character of the database, showing how diversity of the accumulated data can help user build a detailed picture of interactions between the ligand of interest and the target protein. Figure 3 contains screenshots, showing examples of different data and outputs that can be obtained for CTP (ligand in the protein discussed in Figure 2). It starts from results of the sequences search for cytidyltransferase (Figure 3A), where hits are mapped onto the query sequence, and the list of profile hits and their sequence matches are provided in the

# CONCLUSION  

We believe that the most important advantage of this database stems from the strong theoretical foundation of the EFLs and completeness and the level of detail about interactions of representative EFLs with nucleotidecontaining ligands. The most common EFLs were proposed to be most likely descendants of the ancient ring-like peptides, which served as basic building blocks of the first enzymatic domains. Modern proteins and their EFLs follow the basic rules and requirements established in the very beginning of the protein evolution, hence many enzymatic functions can be considered as combinations of the corresponding EFLs. The NBDB database provides a comprehensive set of 249 EFL profiles that interact with 24 nucleotidecontaining ligands and other relevant cofactors. The set of profiles contains different entities, starting from the very common and ancient signatures existing from the origin of life (e.g. profiles of the phosphate binding in dinucleotides and nucleotides, GxGxxG and GxxGxG) and ending with distinct signatures that work in more specific ligands. Since interaction with nucleotide-containing ligand is a key element of many biochemical transformations and signaling processes, we expect that the database will be of great help for researcher working on different aspect of protein function, its evolution and design. Intended expansion of the EFLs collection and characterization of other elementary functions will provide an important theoretical background for experimental efforts in design of required protein functions.
