Task_description: 'Performing the trimming of low-quality reads and artificial sequences with Fastp. The parameters of Fastp are as follows: the window size option shared by sliding (-W) is set to 4, the mean quality requirement option shared by sliding (-M) is set to 20, the quality threshold for a qualified base (-q) is set to 15, the percentage of bases allowed to be unqualified (-u) is set to $40\%$ , one read’s $\mathbf{N}$ base number (- n) is set to 5, and the threshold for the low complexity filter (-Y) is set to 0.'
