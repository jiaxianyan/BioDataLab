!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = Library construction protocol: Five µg of genomic DNA was extracted from frozen cell pellets using the DNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and spiked with 25 ng unmethylated cl857 Sam7 Lambda DNA (Promega, Madison, WI). The DNA was fragmented with a Covaris S2 (Covaris, Woburn, MA) to 300-500 bp, followed by concentration and size selection with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA) at 0.9 X volume, then end repair with dCTP-free dNTPs and addition of a 3'A base. Paired-end cytosine methylated adapters (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were ligated to the sonicated DNA at 16degC for 16 hours with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). Adapter-ligated DNA was isolated by two rounds of purification with AMPure XP beads at 0.9 X volume. Adapter-ligated DNA (450 ng) was subjected to sodium bisulfite conversion using the MethylCode kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) as per manufacturer's instructions. The bisulfite-converted, adapter-ligated DNA molecules were enriched by 4 cycles of PCR with the following reaction composition: 2.5 U of uracil-insensitive PfuTurboCx Hotstart DNA polymerase (Stratagene), 5 µl 10X PfuTurbo reaction buffer, 31 µM dNTPs, 1 µl P7 primer (10 µM), 1 µl Primer5+3 (10 µM), for a final reaction volume of 50 µl. The thermocycling parameters were: 95degC 2 min, 98degC 30 sec, then 6 cycles of 98degC 15 sec, 60degC 30 sec and 72degC 4 min, ending with one 72degC 10 min step. The reaction products were purified using AMPure XP beads at 0.9X volume (two rounds).  Two separate PCR reactions were performed on subsets of the adapter-ligated, bisulfite-converted DNA, yielding two independent libraries from the same biological sample.
