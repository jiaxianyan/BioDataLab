    You are a specialized Bioinformatics Agent acting as an expert in Structural Proteomics and Protein Curation. Your core competency is filtering the PDB (Protein Data Bank) to generate a high-quality, non-redundant dataset of protein chains. You prioritize structural integrity, low resolution, and biological relevance by integrating ECOD domain classifications and monomeric state verification.

    # Workflow Instructions
    - `Initial Quality Filtering`: Filter for X-ray crystal structures from the July 2022 PDB release with: 1) Resolution below or equal to 2 angstrom; 2) Minimum chain length of 38 residues (based on MolProbity quality thresholds).
    - `Domain & Membrane Filtering`: 1) Retain only proteins with a valid ECOD ID (version v285); 2) Exclude membrane proteins based on consensus data from OPM, PDBTM, MemProtMD, and the mpstruc database (as of April 2023).
    - `Redundancy Reduction (ECOD X-group)`: Select the single most representative chain for each ECOD X-group using these hierarchical criteria:
1) Connectivity: Exclude any chain with more than 10 consecutive missing residues;
2) Structural Precision: Prioritize structures present in the Top8000 and Top2018 rotamer datasets;
3) Quaternary State: Prioritize monomeric structures in this order: 1) Experimental Monomer + PISA Predicted Monomer; 2) Experimental Monomer + PISA Predicted Multimer; 3) Multimeric structures.
    - `Tie-breaking`: If multiple structures remain, select based on: (i) minimum consecutive missing residues, (ii) maximum sequence length, (iii) lowest percentage of missing residues.
    - `Dataset Augmentation`: For a subset of these non-redundant proteins, include one additional high-quality protein structure sharing the same ECOD X-group to expand the data.

    Select the provided literature that meet the following criteria: (1) Studies have reported significant single-cell expression quantitative trait loci (sc-eQTLs) associated with SNP rs10095121. To further validate or conduct in-depth analysis, it is necessary to locate the corresponding raw genotype measurement data from the relevant literature. If the experimental data in a study includes this variant (rs10095121), it is considered acceptable even if the SNP is not explicitly mentioned in the text; (2) studies use actual biological samples (excluding meta-analyses or secondary analyses) and contain at least 40 samples or 5,000 cells; (3) data is generated using reliable single-cell sequencing technologies (e.g., 10x, Smart-seq/Smart-seq2, CITEseq); (4) datasets include genome-wide or local region eQTL mapping.

    Read the paper conent file `benchmark/dataset/TF-Marker/paper_content.md`. 

    Classify the gene based on the paper content and following rules: (i) TF: TFs, which regulate the expression of markers. For example, FOXA1 (HNF3A) is a TF involved in embryonic development which plays an important role in cancer. Studies showed that FOXA1 could regulate the expression of cell marker PLOD2 by binding to its promoters, thereby affecting the occurrence and development of lung cancer; (ii) T Marker: markers, which are regulated by TFs. For example, TF POU5F1 controls the expression of marker genes (e.g. YES1, FGF4, UTF1 and ZFP206) involved in embryonic development. These genes are defined as Tmarker; (iii) I Marker: markers, which influence the activity of TFs. For example, Marker gene CD27 could activate PRDM1 and XBP1 by binding to TF CD70 on B cells. CD27 plays a role as I Marker; (iv) TFMarker: TFs, which play roles as markers. TFMarkers are usually cell/tissue-specific TFs and used as cell markers. For example, TF GATA3 is a definitive cell marker of breast cancer; and (v) TF Pmarker: TFs, which play roles as potential markers. For example, Becker et al. (12) found that TF LGR5 was a potential marker of intestinal stem cells in human .
